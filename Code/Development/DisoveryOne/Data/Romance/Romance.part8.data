	First Draft Screenplay

	--------------------------------------------------------------

	INT.  BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT

	Dim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated,
	the congenitally impatient.  Everyone in this queue holds a
	reservation at least an hour overdue.  Tourists can't even make the
	line.  PAN ahead to...

	... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant
	service.  Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving
	by far the most lavish service of all.  Captains hover, presenting
	delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose
	person they screen from our view.  We can see, however...

	... the honored guest's companion.  Ignored, bemused, across the
	table.  This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive.  Kind eyes,
	an intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and
	conservative chalk-stripe suit.  He is gay, but you wouldn't guess
	it.  Loyal and wise and generous, and you might.  He watches with a
	quiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us...

	... their most unlikely icon.  JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears
	her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled
	together in fifteen seconds.  She is unkempt, quick, volatile,
	scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an
	original beauty.  Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender
	expressive fingers, which point to...

				CAPTAIN
		    A variation on our squid ink
		    risotto.  Trace of Moselle, to
		    sweeten the stock.

	She doesn't like that idea at all.  Shoots him a sharp look of
	doubt that makes him smile.  Murmur...

				CAPTAIN
		    Don't kill us on this one, it's
		    a long shot.

	Places the moist lump of black rice before her.  She takes a
	surprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue.  Makes dead
	flat eye contact with Digger.  And nods, it's actually quite nice.
	The Captain breathes with relief.  She turns her dark eyes to him.
	The tone says they're pals...

				JULIANNE
		    I'm writing it up as inventive and
		    confident.  Which it is.  Off the
		    record, I'll need an extra boat of
		    the ink.  Or a salt shaker.

				CAPTAIN
		    I'll toss a coin.

	As the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables,
	which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away.

				DIGGER
		    Is it ever embarrassing, having
		    your bum kissed in public?

				JULIANNE
		    If your ass isn't chapped, you
		    are not a good-writer of note.

	She glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn
	nearby.

				JULIANNE
		    Is it sad to be an editor, and bask
		    only in reflected insincerity?

				DIGGER
		    I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

	She leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial.

				JULIANNE
		    See the pull of a book like
		    Twenty Chefs, is not who I
		    put in.  It's who I leave out.

				DIGGER
		    Which is everyone you couldn't
		    get in.

				JULIANNE
		    Plus some guys whose food I don't
		    like.

	Pushes the risotte across to him.  He lifts a fork.

				DIGGER
		    This fellow from Newsday ever
		    call?

	She shrugs.  Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag.

				JULIANNE
		    I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive
		    and confident, yeh?

	She dials.  He tastes.

				DIGGER
		    Needs salt.

				JULIANNE
		    Is Newsday a real interview, or
		    just some cute guy you're setting
		    me up w...

				DIGGER
		    ... I don't send you men, anymore.
		    You don't know what to do with them.

	She's punching in her code.

				JULIANNE
		    Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.

				DIGGER
		    ... weeks.

	Over the phone, we hear her answering machine...

				MAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft)
		    Hey.  It's Michael.

	And her face changes.  Warms.  Just to hear the guileless voice.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    God, it must be, what, months, huh?
		    I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm
		    in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...

	She looks impressed and surprised.  Fancy place for this guy.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    Call me four in the morning,
		    whatever, we gotta talk.

	As she hangs up.  She still has that look in her eye.  Digger has
	never seen that, and he likes it very much.

				DIGGER
		    Who called? The man of the
		    moment?

	She smiles.  A sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too.
	The Bohemian sophisticate has vanished.

				JULIANNE
		    No, no, the opposite.  That's
		    my best friend, Michael O'Neal.
		    He sounds desperate to talk.

				DIGGER
		    The wandering sportswriter.

	He pushes the risotto back her way.

				DIGGER
		    I didn't know you two had a
		    past.

	Her gaze sharpens.  Hmmn?

				DIGGER
		    The look in your eye.

	She blushes.  Shakes her head, no way.

				JULIANNE
		    Sophomore year at Yale we had
		    this one hot month.  And, you
		    know me, I got restless...

	He knows her.  She got restless.

				JULIANNE
		    So I get up the nerve to break
		    his heart.  I tell him there's
		    this dreamy exchange student
		    from Pakistan who wants to,
		    you know...

	He knows.

				JULIANNE
		    And he gets this... look.  He
		    says, "I knew I couldn't hold
		    your interest", which, of course,
		    makes me feel like the shallow
		    bitch I've always been...

	He nods, yeah.

				JULIANNE
		    Then he says, "But what makes
		    me want to cry.  Is I'm losing
		    the best friend I ever had."

	Hears the feeling.  In her voice.

				JULIANNE
		    And when he said it, I knew.
		    I felt the same.

	Silence now.  She covers with a smile.

				JULIANNE
		    So I cried.  For maybe the third
		    time in my life.  And I kissed
		    him.  And we've been best friends
		    ever since.

	Ever since.  Fingers turning her wine glass...

				JULIANNE
		    Nine years, we've seen each other
		    through everything.  Losing jobs,
		    losing parents, losing lovers...
		    travelled all over, we've had the
		    best times.  The best times of my
		    life, maybe.  Just drinking and
		    talking.  Even over a phone.

				DIGGER
		    Kindred spirits.

				JULIANNE
		    No, he's nothing like me.  He's
		    like you.  Only straight.

	No offense taken.

				JULIANNE
		    He's the salt of the earth.  Kind
		    and loyal and generous.  The one
		    constant thing in my life, is he'll
		    always be there.

				DIGGER
		    He's still in love with you.

	That stops her.  She has to say...

				JULIANNE
		    Maybe.  But it never gets in
		    the way.

	Something she probably hasn't confessed out loud before.  Digger
	understands.

				DIGGER
		    Well, he has a true friend in
		    you.

	He wants her to know he sees that.

				DIGGER
		    Whenever George tells someone
		    how steadfast I am, he always
		    makes me sound boring.

				JULIANNE
		    Solid and genuine is not boring.
		    Michael can be completely insane...

	A young waiter arrives.  Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her
	plate.

				JULIANNE
		    There was this one night in
		    Tucson, like six years ago...
		    we got amazingly drunk, I mean,
		    Keith Richards time...

	The kid tops off her glass of meursault.  Looking at her.

				JULIANNE
		    God, I haven't thought of this
		    in so long...

	The waiter hanging now.  Openly listening.

				JULIANNE
		    I can even believe we did
		    this...

	Digger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes.  So
	she looks up.

				JULIANNE
		    Could you give us a minute?

	The kid stunned, speechless.  People lose jobs for a lot less.

				JULIANNE
		    You won't miss much, I promise
		    there was no sex.

	He reddens and disappears.

				DIGGER
		    I've lost interest.

				JULIANNE
		    He takes a razor from his dinky
		    little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,
		    takes my hand, does the same to me...

	She places the tips of her index fingers together.

				DIGGER
		    Blood oath.

				JULIANNE
		    He says, "Swear.  When we're both
		    28, if we've never been married...
		    we marry each other!"

	And laughs again.  Can you believe that?  But Digger isn't smiling.
	She wonders why.  Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto.

				JULIANNE
		    See, he figured that would be a
		    sign from God, or someone of
		    comparable authority, that we'd
		    misunderstood our destinies.

	He still has this real serious look.  She's still spooning ink.

				JULIANNE
		    We never talked about it again.  I
		    don't know what made me think of...

				DIGGER (quietly)
		    I do.

	And everything.  Stops.  She lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the
	gravity of his tone.

				DIGGER
		    You'll be 28 in three weeks.
		    How old is he?

	Holy.  Fucking.  Shit.  It hits her like a ton of lead bricks.  She
	shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking.

				JULIANNE
		    You think...

				DIGGER
		    Desperate.  To talk.

	She shovels in more drippy black goop.  It is really disgusting.

				JULIANNE
		    He's not proposing marriage,
		    there's no way I'm buying one
		    word of th...

				DIGGER
		    Then why are you compulsively
		    eating? If you're not hysterical?

	More goes in.  Her lips and mouth completely black.  Like a circus
	clown.

				JULIANNE
		    He can't do that to me!

				DIGGER
		    We're about to find out.

	Ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down
	her face.  She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from
	reaching her sweater.

				JULIANNE
		    When I turn him down...

	She realizes the full weight of the truth.

				JULIANNE
		    We'll never be the same.

				DIGGER
		    I have a suggestion...

				JULIANNE
		    I'll have to kill myself before I
		    call him.

	Staring in each other's eyes.

				DIGGER (sadly)
		    That was it.

	INT. JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

	Julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush.
	Gray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball
	jersey she wears as a nightshirt.  In the mirror, her troubled eyes
	dwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on
	the closed toilet lid.

	She spits, sticks her tongue way out.  Incredibly black.  Great.
	Depressed, terrified, and disfigured for life.  She snatches up the
	hated phone, and wanders aimlessly into...

	... her bedroom.  West Village view.  Defiantly jumbled, aggres-
	sively eclectic.  Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it-
	you-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing...

				JULIANNE
		    This is awkward timing, Michael,
		    I just joined this convent, and
		    they never give your deposit ba...

	Stops.  Full-length mirror.  She straightens her hair, to look her
	best.

				JULIANNE
		    Michael, I'm married.

	Not enough.

				JULIANNE
		    ... and I have two weeks to live.

	Changes tone...

				JULIANNE
		    Michael, I'm trying to be gay,
		    don't confuse me.

	She turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser.
	Stuns her, momentarily.  Enough, already! She punches up the
	number, primping absently in the mirror.  When it connects...

				JULIANNE
		    I was calling Michael O'Neal,
		    but seeing it's so late, I could
		    just leave a mes...

	No such luck.  Cut off.  Waits.  And then...

				JULIANNE (soft)
		    Good evening, sir.  You've been
		    enrolled in the Obscene Call Of
		    The Month Club, and th...

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    Hey! God, it's so good to hear
		    your voice.

	She forgets herself.  Because it's good to hear his, too.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    I've been calling for days!

				JULIANNE
		    Yeh, well my old machine kept
		    eating messages.  I tried
		    constructively ignoring it in
		    hopes of improvement, but finally...

				MICHAEL (V.O., urgent)
		    Look, I have to ask you something.

	She swallows.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    Something so incredibly important,
		    that if you turn me down, I don't
		    know what I'll d...

				JULIANNE (bright)
		    I just have to tell you this one
		    thing first, okay? I mean this
		    will hand you the biggest laugh
		    of your adult life...

	Silence.  Come on girl, suck it up.

				JULIANNE
		    I was thinking about you, and I
		    remembered this unbelievably insane
		    night we spent together in Tucson,
		    like a thousand years ago?

	More silence.  Really quiet.

				JULIANNE
		    I mean, there's no way you could
		    possibly remember the...

				MICHAEL (V.O., soft)
		    Are you kidding?

	Stops her.  Like a brick wall.  The sweetness in his voice.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    I think about that night all
		    the time.

	She's going to have a heart attack.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    But it's not why I called.

	She blinks.  It's not.  And just as a tsunami of relief begins to
	sweep away...

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    I called because I met someone.

	And her smiles breaks off.  Like a spine snapping.  Because there is
	something in his voice.

				JULIANNE
		    Well, that's great.  You haven't
		    really had anybody since Dingbat
		    Jennylee...

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    You don't understand.  I've never
		    felt this way about anybody!

	Never.  She sits down, hard.  Right on the floor.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    And she's all wrong for me!

				JULIANNE
		    Well, somet...

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    I mean she's a junior at Chicago
		    University, she's twenty years
		    old! Like when I first met you.

	Like when.  Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    And her dad is like this billionaire
		    who owns the White Sox and some cable
		    empire, and you know how I've always
		    been miserably awkward around those
		    kinda stuffed suits...

	She's finally making her mouth work...

				JULIANNE
		    Well, sure.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    But they're so down to earth, such
		    wonderful people...

				JULIANNE
		    You've met her parents.

				MICHAEL (V.O., quiet)
		    Well.  Sure.

	Wow.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    See.  We're getting married.
		    This Sunday.

	There's a knife in her heart.  She can scarcely breathe.

				JULIANNE
		    Michael, it's Wednesday night,
		    you can't possibly be getting
		    married on Su...

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    Actually, it all starts tomorrow.
		    It's one of those four-day weddings,
		    with all the traditional events, and
		    ten million people flying in from
		    Madagascar such.

				JULIANNE (incredibly lame)
		    Aren't you... working this weekend?
		    I mean, is that responsible?

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's
		    letting me do a profile on the Big
		    Hurt.  That's Frank...

				JULIANNE
			    (barely audible)
		    ... Thomas, yeh.

	She's staring at herself in the mirror.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    Jules.  I'm scared.

	A straw to lunge at.

				JULIANNE
		    Well, maybe we should talk ab...

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    I need you.

	So heartfelt.  A lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    If you can't come.  And hold my
		    hand.  I'll never get through this.

	Oh.

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    Please come, please.

				JULIANNE
		    W...

				MICHAEL (V.O.)
		    I can't wait for you to meet her!

	HOLD ON Julianne.  Staring in the mirror.  Like watching the end of
	her life.

	INT.  BEDROOM - LATER

	The closet, the armoire, all the drawers are wide open.  Two huge
	suitcases open on the bed, into which Julianne is flinging clothes,
	as she fumbles to smoke and dial at the same time.  Over the phone,
	now...

				DIGGER (V.O., machine)
		    You've reached Digger and George.
		    Brevity will be appreciated.

	BEEP.

				JULIANNE (in a rage)
		    IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS
		    UP HAVING SAFE SEX??

	SNATCHES up a tiny, clingy, sexy dress.  Pouts at it.

				JULIANNE
		    OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WHY AREN'T
		    YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER
		    THE PHONE??

	She holds the dress against her body.  It's hot.

				JULIANNE
		    YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT
		    YOU, ISN'T IT??

	She clicks OFF.  Checks the dress in the mirror.  Raises the short
	skirt a little higher.

	INT. DIGGER'S CHEROKEE, JFK AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

	Digger driving the open-air Cherokee up the ramp to United Airlines
	departures.  Julianne, wind-whipped, trying to light a fresh
	cigarette from the butt of the last one.  He glances over.  Hates
	to see this...

				DIGGER
		    You can't get lung cancer and
		    die in four days.  Go to Plan B.

	She sucks deep.  Really deep.

				JULIANNE
		    You have no appropriate sense
		    of emergency.  My best friend
		    is ruining his life.

				DIGGER
		    No, he's ruining yours.

				JULIANNE
		    Same difference.  If you love
		    someone, it's your duty to save
		    them from themselves.

				DIGGER
		    You have a real philosophy of
		    life.

				JULIANNE
		    It's called the Law of Love,
		    asshole.

	She is tight enough to snap.  And at the edge of tears.  Staring
	out at the skycaps, clinging to her cigarette, as he eases to the
	curb.

				DIGGER (gently)
		    Why don't we have a drink? You
		    could catch a later fl...

				JULIANNE
		    I'm a busy girl.  I've got four
		    days to break up a wedding, and
		    steal the bride's fella.

	She finally looks at him.  He doesn't say anything.

				JULIANNE
		    He's adored me for nine goddamn
		    years.

				DIGGER
		    I can see why.

				JULIANNE
		    She knows him maybe five seconds,
		    plus she has billions of dollars,
		    plus she's perfect, so don't go
		    feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!

	He's not.  So her voice softens.  Which shows the hurt.

				JULIANNE
		    And don't go feeling sorry for
		    me, you don't know me that well.
		    We're only friends.

				DIGGER (softly)
		    I stand corrected.

	Tears now.  Stand in her eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm making a big mistake, huh?

				DIGGER (shrugs)
		    Maybe you'll learn something.

	He wraps his hand over hers.  She looks down at it.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm gonna bring him back, man.
		    Against all odds, y'know.  Cos
		    if I don't...

	She wraps her fingers around his.

				JULIANNE
		    ... I gotta live with it forever.

	Looks in his eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    And at my wedding.  I'll be the
		    only bride with her own best man.

	And she kisses his cheek.

	Jumps out of his car.  Before she cries.  Yanks her bags from the
	back.  Brave smile.

	They trade small salutes.  And then she's gone.

	INT.  O'HARA AIRPORT, CHICAGO - MORNING

	The jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony
	called O'Hare.  Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull
	fly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl,
	looking all around, and...

	... there he is.  MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish
	grin, an unruly shock of hair.  He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just
	dangerous enough to be irresistible.  Worthwhile stakes.  His face
	lights to see her, and she...

	... RUNS to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off
	heedless civilians, to be...

	... SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like
	crazy, their cheeks tight together.  When he sets her down...

	... he kisses her nose.  His arms are still around her.

				MICHAEL (murmurs)
		    Can you believe it? Can you believe
		    I'm actually gonna do this?

				JULIANNE (lost in his eyes)
		    Not hardly.

	He beams.  Turns.  She follows his gaze, and...

	... there she is.  KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it
	is a body to die for.  The face is striking, not at all perky and
	vapid, but lovely and interesting.  Worst of all, intelligent.

	She walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in
	her fiancee's arms.  At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne
	and Kimmy...

	... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor.  HOLDS her tight,
	with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back.
	As Michael beams.

				KIMMY
		    This just makes everything so
		    perfect.

	Her arms stay around the slightly dazed Julianne.  The younger
	girl leans close, confides...

				KIMMY
		    All I've heard, from the day I
		    met Michael, is Julianne this,
		    and Julianne that...

				JULIANNE
		    Well, we're...

				KIMMY
		    I think the best part of marrying
		    this guy is finding you.

	Pale gray eyes.  Alive with joy and intimacy.

				KIMMY
		    I've never had a sister.

	INT.  KIMMY'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY

	Kimmy TEARING down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 SL, a
	dashing, confident driver.  Julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a
	total wreck, in the open convertible.  Michael is happily crouched
	on the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees.  The
	roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them.

				KIMMY
		    My heart's in my throat, here.
		    Right off, I have to ask this
		    monstrous favor...

				JULIANNE
		    You need a few dollars.

	Kim glances over.  At eighty miles an hour.  A bittersweet look.

				KIMMY
		    Dry.  Just like he said.

	Her eyes at once admiring and regretful.

				JULIANNE
		    Excuse me?

				KIMMY
		    I can be quick.  I can even
		    be funny.

	Shakes her head.  An endearing youngster.

				KIMMY
		    But I can't be dry.

				JULIANNE
		    Can you watch the road?

				KIMMY
		    See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.

	She looks back to the highway.

				KIMMY
		    This is a very presumptuous
		    and burdensome fav...

				JULIANNE
		    ... you want a menage on your
		    wedding night.

				KIMMY (straight back)
		    No, that wouldn't be burdensome.

	Julianne studying the delicate, angular profile.  Hard not to like
	this kid.

				KIMMY
		    My classmate Angelique shattered
		    her pelvis line dancing in
		    Abeline on Spring Break.

	Looks over.  The sweetest smile.

				KIMMY
		    Be my maid of honor.

	Julianne just blinks.

				KIMMY
		    You can't believe what it'd
		    cost to bring in a temp.

				JULIANNE
		    Uh.  How about promoting a
		    bridesmaid?  Someone you know
		    for at least forty-five minutes.

	We CUT OFF a huge SEMI who BLASTS his horn.  Kimmy fearless,
	oblivious, and analytical...

				KIMMY
		    The bridesmaids are my only two
		    female relatives under forty.
		    Identical twin debutantes from
		    Nashville, who are basically
		    vengeful sluts.  With amazing
		    bodies!

				JULIANNE
		    Which was the disqualifying
		    factor?

				KIMMY
		    The twin part.  I like to remain
		    impartial in my contempt.

	Sees the off-ramp, and SLICES across FOUR LANES of speeding bullets
	in a heart-stopping nanosecond.  This kid could drive for Penske.
	Julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started.  Looks
	back to see if Michael fell out...

	... he is absurdly wind-blown.  Gives her a beautiful grinning
	thumbs-up.  Loves this stuff.

				KIMMY
		    This means I have four days
		    to make you my new best friend...

	Brings Julianne's eyes back...

				KIMMY
		    And since I already know everything
		    about you.  Including intimate
		    facts I'm mortified to have heard,
		    but too envious to forget.  It's
		    time for you to learn about me...

	Easing off the freeway.  She meets Julianne's glance...

				KIMMY
		    Force yourself.  To get personal.

				JULIANNE (smiles)
		    Sounds like a plan.

	INT.  DRESS SHOP, NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE - MORNING

	The place is stunning.  High-ceiling, soft light, large rococo
	mirrors, Louis Quatorze sofas and chairs.  Michael wanders rest-
	lessly, fish out of water among designer displays and stylish
	female patrons.

	Takes a look at his watch.

	INT.  DRESSING ROOM - MORNING

	A period sitting room, ringed with mirrors along its tapestried
	walls.  Kimmy sits on a Louis Treize loveseat next to a stack of
	costly gowns.  Watching with an expertise beyond her years, as...

	... Julianne stands on a platform.  A seamstress fitting her into a
	sleek pale daffodil-colored gown.  There are pins everywhere, as
	the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit.  Continuously
	looking to Kim for approval.

				KIMMY
		    If you'd rather the lilac...

	Julianne shakes her head.  This one is beautiful.

				JULIANNE
		    I thought bridesmaids had to wear
		    the same dress.

				KIMMY
		    Not you.  You won't be comfortable
		    unless you're distinctive.

	Julianne glances over.

				JULIANNE
		    What else did he tell you...

				KIMMY
		    ... you hate weddings, you never go.

	Oh.  Well, yeah.

				KIMMY
		    You're not up for anything
		    conventional, or popularly
		    assumed to be female priorities.
		    Including marriage.  Or romance.
		    Or even...

	And she stops.  Not wanting to offend.

				JULIANNE (quietly)
		    ... not even love.

	The look holds.  The seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.

				JULIANNE
		    That's why Michael and I were
		    the wrong fit.  Right from the
		    start.

				KIMMY
		    He said that, too.

	She stands up.  Walks to the platform.  Smooths her hand over the
	fabric down Julianne's back, along her hips.  Communicating to the
	seamstress with her irritated expression.

				KIMMY
		    Well, I thought I was like you.
		    And proud to be.  Until I met
		    rumpled, smelly old Michael...

	Pins start to come out.  Kimmy points, these, too!

				KIMMY
		    And then I found I was just a
		    sentimental schmuck.  Like all
		    those flighty nitwits I'd always
		    pitied.

	She leans forward.  So they can look at each other.

				KIMMY
		    Funny world, huh?

	Julianne swallows.  It is that.

				JULIANNE
		    I need a smoke.

	And before anyone can breathe, she steps OFF the platform RIPPING
	the living shit out of the gown, right down the side.  The seam-
	stress' eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror.  Julianne, a deer in
	headlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in
	six different mirrors.

	Kimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...

				KIMMY
		    It's mostly the seam.  Let's
		    get this to Carlos.

	And UNZIPS Julianne down the back.  In her rush to step out,
	Julianne STUMBLES,  but her arms are pinned by the pulled-down dress
	and she just...

	... TOPPLES like a felled oak, THUDDING on her face, the gown
	RIPPING some more, the seamstress SCREAMING like an idiot.

	Then.  Silence.  Julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog,
	bound in her dress.

				KIMMY (firm)
		     Just.  Don't.  Move.

	Like you talk to a three-year-old.  Deftly, Kimmy pulls the
	dress free, leaving Julianne in her underwear.  Signals to the
	seamstress, let's go.

				JULIANNE
		    Don't you have to be somewh...

				KIMMY
		    ... just my bridal shower.  And
		    Michael has to meet our dads and
		    the groomsmen at Comiskey for a
		    one-thirty game.

	Opens the door...

				KIMMY
		    Other than that...

	Closed SOLID.  Gone.

	INT.  DRESSING ROOM - LATER

	Julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties, lighting one
	cigarette from the butt of another.  Suddenly, she hears...

	... an ARGUMENT outside the door.  Strains to listen.  It does sound
	like Michael and Kim.  We can't make out the words.  She jumps up,
	dashes for the door, STUBBING her toe on the platform, SHIT!, falls
	heavily AGAINST the door with a THUD that makes her wince, and...

	... the argument stops.  Damn.  She opens the door a crack.  Sees
	nothing.  Opens it wider to reveal...

	... a teenaged BOY looking right at her.  He sends a true shit-
	eating grin and she SLAMS the door hard enough to RATTLE walls.

	She PACES furiously, helplessly, arms around her half-naked self,
	until...

	... soft knock.  The door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown
	comes through it.

				JULIANNE
		    Come in, and shut the...

	Stops.  Because it's Michael who has entered.  With the dress.

				JULIANNE
		    ... door.

	So he does.  She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes, which
	were characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to
	untangle them enough to cover herself.  He is amazed and amused by
	her embarrassment.

				MICHAEL (laughing)
		    Should I turn around, or someth...

				JULIANNE
		    Michael, I'm in my underwear!

	She's TEARING at her clothes, only making more of a mess.

				MICHAEL
		    We've seen each other a lot
		    more naked than this.

	She seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them
	from her hands.  She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily
	untangles them.

				MICHAEL
		    I mean, we were skinny-dipping
		    in Greece, just as pals, less
		    than two years ago.

	She GRABS the clothes and covers the front of herself.  Looking at
	him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out.

				JULIANNE
		    Things are different now.

	He looks in her eyes.  And nods, a little sadly.  Guess they are.

				MICHAEL (softly)
		    Well.  I leave with two thoughts
		    in my mind.

	He walks to the door.  Puts his hand on the latch.  Looks back...

				MICHAEL (even softer)
		    You're still a very pretty
		    girl.

	The look holds.  And holds.  There is such feeling on both sides,
	she doesn't know what to make of it.  She swallows.

				JULIANNE
		    What's the sec...

				MICHAEL
		    Mirrors.

	And he's gone.  She looks around at six different VIEWS of her
	uncovered backside.  Hmm.

	INT.  HOTEL UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

	The parking valets wait by their stand as the convertible pulls up.
	These girls must be late for something, the way they're jumping out
	of the car.

				JULIANNE
		    ... luckiest guy in the Northern
		    Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...

				KIMMY
		    What? Because I'm a little
		    understand...

				JULIANNE
		    ... most sentimental schmucks I
		    pity want a honeymoon after their
		    wedding.  Just to top it off.

	The valet gives Kimmy her ticket.

				KIMMY
		    I can't expect the NBA to hold
		    up the playoffs...

	They're walking fast toward the garage elevators...

				KIMMY
		    I'm excited Sports Illustrated
		    gave him this kind of shot, he's
		    only there a ye...

				JULIANNE
		    So your honeymoon is exactly where?

	Well...

				KIMMY
		    It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps
		    Sacramento, we could start there.
		    Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana-
		    Clevel...

				JULIANNE
		    ... garden sports, all.  Little swing
		    of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit,
		    represents a packing challenge, but
		    there's fine food and cocktails at a
		    choice of Embassy Suit...

	At the elevator.  Kimmy SLAMS the button.

				KIMMY
		    It's his career, I'm supportive.
		    Look, I've been everywhere, I've
		    seen the world, I've laid on a beach.
		    I want to be with the man I love.
		    That's what makes it a honeymoon.

	End of story.  Okay?

				JULIANNE
		    I'm just saying he's lucky.

	An empty elevator arrives.  They get in.

				JULIANNE
		    Takes one woman in a billion to
		    put up with his array of shit.
		    The guy is a one-man festival of
		    idiosync...

	Kimmy SLAMS the penthouse button.  Looks at her calmly.  Go on.

				JULIANNE
		    Well.  You've been introduced
		    to the symphonic range of...

				KIMMY
		    ... his snoring, yeah.  He says
		    it's worse than ever.  That
		    snaffle one...?

	Julianne imitates an incredibly annoying high-pitched SNARL.  Three
	times.  Kimmy nods.

				KIMMY
		    Well now it has this sorta
		    phlegm rattle behind it...

	Stopped at the lobby.  A family of four gets in.  Oblivious, Kimmy
	DEMONSTRATES the phlegm rattle.  Really gets into it.  As the
	family watches, Julianne tries her own version.  Like that? No.
	More like this.  The family is looking at each other.

				KIMMY
		    Guess what? Earplugs work.

	Oh.

				JULIANNE
		    How about...

				KIMMY
		    ... cigars in bed? I broke him
		    on that.  But the bathroom's a
		    swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner,
		    tells the same, admittedly funny,
		    jokes three hundred times...

	Sucks in a breath...

				KIMMY
		    ... loves action movies, subscribes
		    to Playboy for godsake, reads over
		    my shoulder, can't keep track of
		    the checks he writes...

	Ninth floor.  The family gets out.  The door closes.

				KIMMY
		    He sucks soup through his
		    front teeth.

				JULIANNE
		    A trademark move, don't touch
		    it.

				KIMMY
		    But he sure can kiss.

				JULIANNE
		    It's been awhile.  I'll take
		    your word.

				KIMMY
		    After two weeks of cataloguing
		    all his faults, I made a command
		    decision that changed my life.

	She SLAMS the EMERGENCY STOP button.  We JOLT to a halt.

				KIMMY
		    I threw the list away.

	Shakes her head.

				KIMMY
		    He's not a balance sheet, so
		    many wonderful qualities, so
		    many faults.  He's Michael.

	From her heart.

				KIMMY
		    And loving him means loving
		    all of this.

				JULIANNE
		    Do you get nervous in small
		    confined spaces?

				KIMMY
		    So it's sweet of you to be
		    protective...

				JULIANNE
		    Let me rephrase that...

				KIMMY
		   But nothing ever could, ever
		   did, give me a moment's pause
		   about this marriage...

				 JULIANNE
		   Do you get hysterical in small
		   confined spa...

				KIMMY
		    ... except one.

	Julianne's face.  Stops.

				JULIANNE
		    Oh, yeah?

	Kimmy nods.  Confides...

				KIMMY
		    You.

	A stopper.

				KIMMY
		    You'll always be there.  In his
		    mind.  The perfect creature he
		    loved for all those y...

				JULIANNE
		    Well, perfection can get wearing
		    after whi...

				KIMMY
		    I'm not joking.  I had to face
		    up to all my competitive drives,
		    and believe me, I've got 'em.

				JULIANNE
		    No.

				KIMMY
		    And the answer was so simple.

				JULIANNE
		    I was gonna predict that.

				KIMMY
		    You win.

	Julianne blinks.  Excuse me?

				KIMMY
		    You're enshrined in his heart
		    and memory.  Unassailable.
		    Which works out great.

				JULIANNE
		    I've missed a step.

				KIMMY
		    He has you on a pedestal.  And
		    me in his arms.

	Oh.  Julianne smiles.  LUNGES for the EMERGENCY button, YANKING it
	so hard it comes OFF in her hand.  A terrifying BUZZER ensures.

				JULIANNE
		    Jesus, we're trapped!

				KIMMY
		    Ju...

				JULIANNE
		    No, this happened to me once,
		    almost, it was excruciating!

	Begins BANGING random buttons, out of control.  Kimmy watching
	this.  Julianne looks WILDLY up...

				JULIANNE
		    There's a panel up there, you
		    could boost me...

	RIPPING off her platform shoes.

				JULIANNE
		    You know how little air is
		    in these things? I've seen
		    statistics! Once you're trapped
		    between floors...

	Kimmy taps her.  Points to the lighted panel.  It says PH, they've
	reached the Penthouse.

				JULIANNE
		    God! Then the door is jammed!

	Takes a heavy platform and begins BANGING the metal door with all
	her strength, sending resounding BOOMS throughout the area, as
	Kimmy reaches and...

	... presses DOOR OPEN.  The metal doors part, opening directly onto
	the banquet room, just as a mighty blow comes down, and the platform
	FLIES from Julianne's hand straight BETWEEN...

	... two identical stunning YOUNG WOMEN, serving as twin hostesses
	for the shower.  A beat of mutually-stupefied looks, and we hear
	the shoe CRASH somewhere, to a small spattering of SHRIEKS.

				MANDY
		    Mah Gawd, it's the bride,
		    and the woman she'll nevah
		    live up to!

				KIMMY (mutters to Julianne)
		    That would be us.

				SAMMY
		    Did she say th' wrong thang
		    agin? It is so in character!

	AMANDA and SAMANTHA NEWHOUSE, 19-year-old twins.  True Southern
	belles, with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil
	wrestling.  Mandy's hair is dyed ash blonde, Sammy's is amber.
	Otherwise, the experience is similar.

				JULIANNE
			    (thrusts out her hand)
		    I'm Julianne Potter, and...

				SAMMY
		    ... we'd be the vengeful sluts.
		    We came in complementary colors.

				MANDY
		    Have you sized up the groomsmen,
		    Jules?  As M. of H., you get
		    first fuck.  Don't pick the
		    short, hairy, rich one.

				JULIANNE
		    ... unless he has a hump.

	The girls cast identical blank looks at Kimberly.

				KIMMY (to the sluts)
		    Dry.  I told you.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
		    Is this Michael's Julianne?

	All eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40.  She has her
	daughter's hair and eyes and slender form.  But the bearing rules
	half an empire.  Fonda would envy.

				ISABELLE
		    I'm Isabelle Wallace, and my
		    handsome new son scarcely did
		    you justice, girl.

	She takes both of Julianne's hands, and our heroine is sort of
	magically charmed.  As if touched by Glinda the Good Witch of the
	North.

				ISABELLE
		    Now, my husband says to scoot
		    you over to the ballpark, so
		    you can hang with Michael.  But
		    first, you have to meet a lot of
		    really old women.

	Looking warmly in her eyes...

				ISABELLE
		    That is, if you've absorbed
		    enough profanity.

	Flicks a glance at the twins.  Leads Julianne off...

				MANDY (O.S., pouting)
		    We sayed one fuck.

	INT.  TAXI, SOUTH SIDE - DAY

	Cab crawling toward COMISKEY PARK through stifling traffic.
	Julianne oblivious, cellular to her ear...

				JULIANNE
		    Desperate measures! Do you
		    hear me?  Digger, are you the...

	SQUAWK.  Static.  Then...

				JULIANNE
		    I don't know, hit men, whoopee
		    cushions, saltpeter, something!
		    The girl is impossibly impregnable.
		    Even I want her to get the guy!!

	Listens.

				JULIANNE
		    Tell him the what? The truth...??

	She shakes her head.  What a guy.

				JULIANNE
		    That desperate.  May I never get.

	INT.  LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON

	Game in progress.  Watched by Michael, three groomsmen his age, two
	middle-aged men, and one bodyguard.  Suddenly, a dull THUMPING at
	the door.  It keeps up.  They finally all look over.  The bodyguard
	gets the door, revealing...

				JULIANNE
		    Which of you gents ordered
		    two beers?

	One single tray.  Holding fourteen beers.  Balancing on one hand.
	Michael JUMPS UP, terrified at the impending mayhem this sight
	suggests...

				MICHAEL
		    Wow!  Lemme give you a ha...

				JULIANNE (sweetly)
		    Michael.  You'll unwittingly
		    imply that I'm clumsy.

	He stops in his tracks.  The guys whistle.

				MICHAEL
		    Think of that.  And as well as
		    I know you.

	She goes first to the bodyguard.

				  BODYGUARD
		    Sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty.

				JULIANNE (lovely smile)
		    It's Miss.  And thanks.  That
		    leaves two for me.

	Heads down the row...

				MICHAEL
		    Julianne Potter, this is Hank
		    and Gerry from SI, and you know
		    Daniel...

	She's nodding, flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter
	of the tray, keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center.
	Michael is flat dumbstruck.  Next, a tall patrician gentleman with
	rolled-up sleeves on his hand-stitched silk shirt...

				MICHAEL
		    Oh.  This is my father-in-law,
		    Walter.

	Once again, she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished
	father-in-law...

				MICHAEL
		    How are you doing this? You're
		    on drugs.

	Sets them down.  The man has a smile wonderful in its ease.
	Murmurs...

				  WALTER
		    If he gives you grief, I'll have
		    him skillfully beaten, where the
		    wounds won't show.

				JULIANNE
		    I guess getting him whacked would
		    be politically out of the question.

				WALTER
		    Under the circumstances.  Charmed
		    to know you, Jules.

				JULIANNE
		    Nice meeting you, too, Walt.

	A nod between equals.  She moves on...

				MICHAEL
		    And, this guy, you know...

	She sure does, and effortlessly balancing her one-hand load, she
	dips to kiss a porky, balding guy with big-time shoulders.
	Straight on the lips.

				JULIANNE
		    Papa Joe.

	They go way back.  He is uncomfortable at this rich man's wedding,
	even as gracious as everyone has been.  His watering eyes twinkle
	at her, and the voice has a trace of Boston...

				JOE
		   You gonna be my boy's best man?

	Despite SHOUTS from the others...

				JULIANNE
		    Best everything, Joe.  But I'm
		    going to dance with you.

				MICHAEL
		    Dance?  You don't dance!  You
		    learn to dance??

	Her innocent smile.

				JULIANNE
		    Moves.  You've never seen.

	BIG reaction from the guys, as she heads toward Michael with the
	last of the beers, not looking down at the FIELDER'S MITT which
	lies right in her path, and as his lips part to scream a warning,
	she skips...

	... neatly AROUND it.  He's in shock.

				MICHAEL
		    You're an impostor! What have
		    you done with my best friend?

	As he takes away the remaining beers...

				MICHAEL
		    And how was the hot dog?

	Hot dog? His eyes fix on her left breast.  HUGE mustard stain.
	She can't believe it.

				MICHAEL
		    Cheap and unnecessary.  We were
		    looking anyway.

	EXT.  LUXURY BOX ROOF - DAY

	Michael and Julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury
	box roof.  The game, the stadium, spread out beneath them.  Yet
	they are alone in the world.  She dangles her legs, and we can hear
	her kicking the glass below.

				JULIANNE
		    I just admire your maturity,
		    that's all.  I mean, there are
		    people who would find that kind of
		    perfection boring.  Day after day,
		    year after year...

				MICHAEL
		    ... see, that's what I thought at
		    first.  How can you like someone
		    that perfect? No potential for
		    long-range livability.

	Drinking their beers.  Side by side.  Both stare only at the game.

				MICHAEL
		    Luckily.  The closer I watched,
		    the more the fault came into
		    focus.  Each imperfection its own
		    adorable slice of vulnerability.

				JULIANNE
		    Such as.

				MICHAEL
		    She's too genuine.

				JULIANNE
		    Hate that.

				MICHAEL
		    How can you trust someone you
		    can never mistrust?

				JULIANNE
		    What's next?

	Keep sipping.  Never look at each other.

				MICHAEL
		    No matter how many times I
		    leave the toilet seat up, she
		    forgets and puts it down.

				JULIANNE
		    Endearingly absent-minded.

				MICHAEL
		    My very point.  Here's another one...

	Shakes his head.  This one really gets him.

				MICHAEL
		    Every day.  She makes the bed.

				JULIANNE
		    Quite the little eccentric.

				MICHAEL
		    At first, I thought it was a
		    gag, but she's always done it!

	This is not the ammunition Julianne was hoping for.

				JULIANNE
		    Is there a coup de grace in
		    here, somewh...

				MICHAEL
		    She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.

				JULIANNE
		    Waiter! Check, please!

				MICHAEL
		    She finds him "personable."

				JULIANNE
		    Can that kind of defect be
		    passed on genetically?

	She looks over now.  And Michael is looking back.  Smiling the most
	wonderful smile.  Her reaction shows that she thinks it's for her,
	until...

				MICHAEL
		    Then again.  She has a few good
		    traits.

	Hating herself for asking, but seeing no way out...

				JULIANNE
		    Gimme like, eight and nine off
		    the top ten list...

				MICHAEL
		    First girl I ever knew.  Who
		    lets me give her a bath.

	The look in his eyes.  She can hardly bear it.

				MICHAEL
		    And when I hug her, even in
		    public.  I don't have to let go
		    right away.  She lets me hold
		    her as long as I want.

	He seems so deeply in love.

				MICHAEL
		    Nice kid, don't you think?

	A beat.  A slow nod.  A quiet...

				JULIANNE
		    Looks like, from here.

	INT.  SOUTH SIDE CLUB - NIGHT

	A slender black woman sings a SOARING Gospel number, backed by
	three ladies who could each solo in any church choir.  It is
	mesmerizing, stirring, transcendent.  The unseen audience CLAPPING
	FIERCELY in rhythm, SHOUTING support.  SLOW PAN now...

	... every face is black.  We aren't in church at all, but a
	venerable blue club.  One of those places you'd swear everybody's
	played, from Robert Johnson to Bessie Smith and back again.  As
	the song ends, there is APPLAUSE, some RAPPING on tables with their
	knuckles or their drunks.  We keep PANNING to a far corner.  Three
	faces.

	Julianne leans across her beer to Kimmy...

				JULIANNE
		    How'd you find this pl...

	Kim shaking her head.  Looks admiringly to Michael...

				KIMMY
		    Lived here my whole life,
		    never heard of it.  Until
		    our first date.

	She reaches slender fingers.  Traces one back along his hair.

				KIMMY
		    He finds all these spots,
		    everywhere he goes, it's a
		    mystical gift.

				MICHAEL (shy)
		    Jesus, one d-back from the Bears
		    knows a place...

				KIMMY
		    It's not just clubs.  This guy
		    always knows the best everything.
		    The best guitar store, the best
		    beef ribs, the best Horowitz record,
		    was he always like the...

				JULIANNE
		    ... always.  The best dim sum, the
		    best camping stuff...

				KIMMY
		    Stop, we're embarrassing h...

				JULIANNE
		    ... best valley in New Zealand,
		    best... women's shoes...

				MICHAEL
		    I tried those on.  When you
		    weren't looking.

	Now he's grinning at Julianne.  And she likes that a lot.

				JULIANNE
		    Where was that, Florence, huh?

				MICHAEL
		    Firenze.

	Together in the memory.  As Kimmy watches.

				JULIANNE
		    The Vespa? Me hanging on behind
		    in the rain all night?

				MICHAEL
		    Till the gas ran out.

	And, the first sniff of left-out...

				KIMMY
		    I love Florence.

	Julianne's eyes flicker.  Could this be a teensy opening? Keeps
	her eyes, her easy smile, and her killer instincts trained on
	Michael.

				JULIANNE
		    Take her there.

	He nods, okay.

				JULIANNE
		    I mean, now.  She's perky,
		    she deserves a honeymoon.

	He draws a breath...

				JULIANNE
		    I heard.  If San Antone sweeps
		    Sacramento.  What is this shit?
		    You gotta get off the road by
		    September anyway, when does Fall
		    Quarter start?

	And the happy couple look at each other.  They are awkward.
	Julianne's heart soar like eagle.

				KIMMY
		    Uh.  I'm not coming back.  For
		    senior year.

	Could this be.  The Mother Lode?

				JULIANNE
		    Don't architects find a degree,
		    sort of... an asset?

	The couple still staring in each other's eyes.

				KIMMY
		    Well, the school will be here.
		    Architecture will still be around.
		    Right now...

				MICHAEL
		    I travel every week.  College
		    ball, motor sports, training
		    camps...

				KIMMY
		    The most important thing. Is
		    being together.

	And she smiles.  Beautifully.

				KIMMY
		    I'm just a baby.  I've got all...
		    the time... in the world.

	EXT.  CLUB - NIGHT

	Michael putting Kim in the back of a cab.  As Julianne watches.

				MICHAEL
		    Because I could come...

				KIMMY
		    To the twins' soiree?  So they
		    can paw you and drool...?

				JULIANNE (calls out, helpful)
		    They're gonna drool anyway!

	Kim smiles.  He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window.  She
	waves past him at Julianne.

				KIMMY (to both)
		   Enjoy each other.

	And drives off.  As he watches after, Julianne comes up behind him.
	Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle.  Starts giving a little
	massage.

				JULIANNE
		    Should I whistle down a cab?

				MICHAEL
		    Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm
		    cheap, remember?

	Turns his head, to see her.  She's still rubbing his shoulder.

				JULIANNE
		    Sometimes.  About the dumbest
		    things.

	Share a smile.  As always, it covers a lot of years.

				MICHAEL
		    The El's right down the street.
		    Unless you're afraid of the
		    neighborhood.

	She looks around.  It is an issue.  But she remembers...

				JULIANNE
		    No.  I'm always safe with you.

	She means that.  He takes her by the hand.  They begin walking...

				JULIANNE
		    Pretty amazing girl, you've got.
		    Make that kind of sacrifice.

				MICHAEL
		    What, leaving school...

				JULIANNE
		    ... all of it.  She's leaving her
		    family, her friends, everything she
		    knows.  She's putting her career
		    on hold, and she seems a pretty
		    ambitious, driven, kind of pers...

				MICHAEL (quietly)
		    In her way.

				JULIANNE
		    All to follow you in this dumb
		    job, where you travel 52 weeks
		    a year to College Station, Texas,
		    and such.  It's not a job for a
		    grown man, Michael, Peter Pan
		    never married.

	He's let go of her hand now.  Looking down at the pavement before
	him, fists in his jacket pockets.

				JULIANNE (softly)
		    I don't think she's naturally
		    the... submissive type.  Aren't you
		    afraid she's gonna choke on this
		    stand-by-your-man shit after awhi...

				MICHAEL (real quiet)
		    No.

	Hit a nerve.  This is promising.

				JULIANNE
		    I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable
		    sports... most girls in her spot would
		    be angling to get Daddy to offer you
		    some juicy gig right here in t...

				MICHAEL
		    She would never.  Never.  Even think
		    of that.

	Paydirt.  Julianne's Geiger Counter is going berserk.

				JULIANNE
		    I guess you're right.  That would
		    be deceitful... manipulative...
		    controlling... emascula...

				MICHAEL
		    I got the point.

	He looks over at her.  No smile on his face.  An edge we haven't
	seen.  She shrugs...

				JULIANNE
		    Still.  All's fair in love and
		    w...

				MICHAEL
		    That would be a girl.  I don't
		    even know.

	They've reached the stairs to the El.  A rickety train RATTLES
	above them.  As they start up, she slips her arm around his
	waist...

				JULIANNE (murmurs)
		    Forgive me, okay? I was talkin'
		    crazy.

	He slides his arm around her shoulder.  Pals.  They climb out of
	frame.

	INT.  HOTEL BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

	CLOSE on a shallow pool of water in a bathroom sink.  Green powder
	pouring in, a hand SWIRLING it around, until...

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    It's Albanian, I think.  Or Mongolian.
		    Or Canadian.  One of those.  I bought
		    it downstairs...

	... it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud.

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    I figure, what the hell.  Can it
		    make me look worse?

	Follow the hand up as it SLATHERS the shit across her face in great
	green dripping gobs.  She's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep
	it mudless, as she assures Digger...

				JULIANNE
		    Dig, of course.  Of course, of
		    course, of course, of course I
		    have a plan.  Certainment!

	More green slime.  The Julianne we know disappears.

				JULIANNE
		    How? I ask myself, what would
		    Lucy Ricardo do in this situa...

	Desecrates three hotel towels, wiping her hand.

				JULIANNE
		    Well, one worked, once.

	THROWS them in the bathtub.  Fastidiousness a short suit.

				JULIANNE
		    Ricky wouldn't let her in
		    the show.

	Reaches for her toothbrush, absently.  All her attention is on the
	conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror.

				JULIANNE
		    I recall it differently, but
		    we digress.

	Without looking, picks up a tube of hotel shampoo...

				JULIANNE
		    So in the version, you're Ethel,
		    with better fashion instincts.

	Squeezes it all over the toothbrush.

				JULIANNE
		    This puts you in charge of Plan B,
		    the unprincipled and insanely
		    dangerous back-up plan...

	Lifts it toward her mouth, liquid shampoo dripping from the
	bristles.

				JULIANNE
		    In case simple lying doesn't work.

	At the last second.  She stops.  We don't know why, because she's
	still never looked at the brush.

				JULIANNE
		    Question.  What happens if you
		    brush your teeth with shampoo?

	Turns on the tap.  Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and DROPS
	the phone into the green swamp, which SPATTERS all over her front.
	Euucch.  She's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down
	to it...

				JULIANNE
		    HOLD ON.  I'M COMING IN FOR YOU!

	She sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit.  Decides to
	YANK on the phone's cord, and the receiver SPRINGS out, BOPPING
	her in the face.  She's so filthy at this point, she just wipes it
	clean on her nightshirt.  Tells Digger...

				JULIANNE
		    You okay? This is one of those
		    problem phones.

	Lifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit.

				JULIANNE
		    Right.  Your role.  You know guys
		    from Sports Illustrated, yes? I
		    mean, you can walk right in there...

	Squeezes on the paste, lifts the brush to her mouth...

				JULIANNE
		    You could get access to letterhead,
		    for example.

	JAMS it in her mouth, brushing as...

				JULIANNE (mouthful)
		    ... or even, maybe, their fax.

	Stops.  The funniest look on her face.  Down to the toothpaste
	tube...

	Which says BEN GAY.

	Oh.

	INT.  TIFFANY'S - MORNING

	Julianne and Kimmy cruise the stately display cases.  Everywhere,
	the Tiffany logo, the silent, watchful staff in morning coats.  As
	they browse, Julianne takes a blueberry Danish from a paper sack,
	and begins to eat.

	The staff notices.  So does Kim.

				JULIANNE
		    It's an homage thing.

	Hmm?

				JULIANNE
		    Awkward girls grow up on Audrey
		    Hepburn movies.  You wouldn't
		    understand.

	Kimmy doesn't.  But wipes a blue glob from Julianne's face.

				KIMMY
		    Anyway, I think you're wrong.

	Wrong?

				KIMMY
		    What you were saying before.

	Before?

				KIMMY
		    About Michael's job.

				JULIANNE
		    Oh, that.  I forgot I even said
		    th...

				KIMMY
		    I just think you're wrong, is all.

				JULIANNE
		    Probably am.  Forget I brought it
		    up.

	Points to some jade pins.  Kimmy wrinkles her nose.

				KIMMY
		    I mean, he loves his job.

				JULIANNE
		    Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad
		    flights, bad hotels, real bad food.
		    Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe
		    your copy gets into one issue out
		    of four...

	Smiles.

				JULIANNE
		    What's not to love?

	None of this is lost on Kimmy.  She's wondered the same.

				KIMMY
		    But he always says...

				JULIANNE
		    ... whatever is manly and
		    independent.

	Kim nods slowly.  Way ahead of her.

				JULIANNE
		    Why would he trade that for
		    running, say, a big piece of
		    the PR at a powerful, complex,
		    challenging conglomerate like
		    your dad's?

	Kim stares back.  A strange look.

				KIMMY
		    That's just the sort of thing
		    my father and I discussed.

	Julianne just blinks.  Amazed.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm not stupid.  Say, how
		    about this?

	Pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case.  Kim so
	absorbed by the main topic, she has to force herself to focus on...

				KIMMY
		    For the twins? What in the
		    world is th...

				JULIANNE
		    Gold nose hair clippers.

	Points to the tiny hand-lettered sign.  Indeed.  Kimmy shrugs, not
	quite it.

				KIMMY
		    So you don't think Michael's
		    as happy with his job as...

	Julianne points to a matched pair of large...

				KIMMY
		    Gold dog collars? They don't
		    have dogs.

				JULIANNE
		    Hello.

	Kim nods, oh.  But can't keep her mind off...

				KIMMY
		    You think he'd accept?

	Hmm?

				KIMMY
		    Michael.  A job like that.

	Oh, well...

				JULIANNE
		    By any yardstick that involves
		    sanity, it would be the greatest
		    thing that ever happened to him.
		    Present company excepted.

	Kimmy nodding slowly.  Her yearing achingly apparent.

				JULIANNE
		    On the other hand, he's proud.
		    Last thing a man wants to admit,
		    is being trapped in a dispiriting
		    dead-end job that can never
		    support a family.

	A very sweet smile.

				JULIANNE
		    Throw a man a life preserver.
		    He'll say, "Thanks, anyway,
		    I'd rather drown."

	Kim nods again.  Right.  They are so bonded at this moment.

				KIMMY
		    So... one almost has to...

				JULIANNE
		    Exactly.

				KIMMY
		    Exactly what?

				JULIANNE
		    What you said.  Make it appear
		    that he's doing you the favor.

	Kimmy bites her lip.  Her eyes go down.  Self-conscious to admit...

				JULIANNE
		    I couldn't really... do that.
		    After, you know...

	Her voice trails off.

				JULIANNE (kind, but wise)
		    ... lying.  All the time.

	That brings the gray eyes up.  Julianne bats her dark ones...

				JULIANNE
		    Oh, darling, my pitiful desires
		    and ambitions are dirt beneath
		    the manly boots of your priorities!

	Kimmy has to smile small.  A self-awe gal.

				JULIANNE (pouring it on)
		    Two hundred seedy motels a year?
		    Dinners out of vending machines?
		    Waiting for you in vermin-infested
		    corridors of dark crotch-rot locker
		    rooms? This stuff makes me hot!!

				KIMMY
		    The very words I've used.

	Julianne 'thinks it over.' Kimmy waits for guidance.

				JULIANNE
		    We make Dad your co-conspirator.
		    Michael does a favor for Walter.

	Simple.

				JULIANNE
		    Walter's reorganizing his public
		    relations, needs a brilliant guy
		    who's close to him, who he can
		    completely trust.

	Kimmy nodding.  Hope overriding reason.

				JULIANNE
		    So you beg.  Michael, please do
		    this for Daddy, please, please,
		    please, blah, blah, blah... it's
		    only for six months...  it would
		    mean so much to me to help him out...

	Turns up her palms.  Viola!

				KIMMY
		    He'll see right through it.

				JULIANNE
		    Only.  If he wants to.

	They share a smile.

				JULIANNE
		    In six months, he'll be happy,
		    settled, successful...

				KIMMY
		    He won't get mad, huh?

				  MR.  MOONEY (O.S.)
		    May I be of any help, whatsoever?

	Mr.  Mooney is the most gracious Brit salesperson ever to offer
	kindness, intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer.  He is
	large, sixty, with disappearing hair, watering eyes, and a manner
	that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler.

				JULIANNE
		    Bridesmaid gifts for two, well,
		    assertive, outspoken, Tennessee
		    debutantes.

				KIMMY (still focused)
		    He won't be mad?

				JULIANNE (to Mooney)
		    Nothing here seems to quite capture
		    their distinctive personalities.

				  MR.  MOONEY
		    Something customized, perhaps?
		    We can fashion most any item
		    from gold.

	Ah.  Julianne nodding.  Reflecting.

				MR.  MOONEY
		    An object that might represent
		    what is closest. To their heart.

				KIMMY (under her breath)
		    Don't even think dildo.

	Julianne digs through her jumbled bag...

				JULIANNE
		    Could you do this...

	Tossing an object on the counter...

				JULIANNE
		    In 24 carat?

	It is a MASTERCARD.  A gold one.

				KIMMY (softly)
		    Bingo.

	They smile at each other.  More bonded than ever.

				KIMMY
		    You don't think he'll be mad.

	A beat.  Can Julianne even make herself do this?

				JULIANNE
		    Your call.  You can live a lie.
		    In a fabulous selection of Red
		    Roof Inns.  Or you can make one
		    desperate stab at hap...

				KIMMY
		    I just don't want to freak him
		    out.

	What do you think? Julianne stares into the soft gray eyes.  It's
	now or never.  The smile of a dear sister...

				JULIANNE
		    How mad could he get?

	INT.  FASHION RESTAURANT - LUNCH HOUR

	Julianne enters with a really nervous Kimberly in tow.  Approaches
	the maitre d'.  We CLOSE to hear...

				MAITRE D'
		    Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests
		    have retired to the humidor.

	Points to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine.  Behind a glass
	wall, what looks like a British men's club.  Thirty guys and a
	billion cigars.  As Julianne starts toward it...

				MAITRE D'
		    Oh.  Mademoiselle.

	She turns back.  Loves this shit.

				MAITRE D'
		    It's unofficial, of course.  But,
		    traditionally, the humidor is for
		    gentlemen, only...

				JULIANNE
		    Great.  I've got this girlfriend
		    at the Justice Department?  With
		    all this time on her hands?

	Her look is every bit as hard as his.  He gestures to the
	escalator.  She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go.  We can see
	Walter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie.  Kimmy
	licks her lips.

	They enter.  Every head turns.  A nice range of reactions, from
	offended to attracted and points in between.

				JULIANNE (murmurs)
		    Piece of cake.  I'll hang, and
		    think happy thoughts...

	Kimmy nods.  Heads over toward her father.  Julianne walks,
	confidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of
	cigars.  Every eye in the place is on her butt.

	She runs her fingers over a few contenders.  Plucks one out,
	examines it, puts it back.  Walks a little farther.  Selects
	another, big and black.  Rolls it expertly in her fingers.  Sniffs
	along its length.

	A guy comes over.  Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe.
	Nearly as attractive as he thinks he is.

				GUY
		    Know what you're looking for,
		    little lady?

	Little lady, huh? She glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend
	not to notice.  Then, straight to the guy's blue eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    Yeah.  Do you?

				GUY
		    I asked first.

	Ah.  Wit.  She holds up her cigar...

				JULIANNE
		    I like 'em long and hard.  Kind
		    of... big around.

	Runs it under her nose.

				JULIANNE
		    Smell is important, I'm a believer
		    in that.

	Takes a match from a cut crystal bowl.

				JULIANNE
		    But you never know what you've
		    got.  Till you run your tongue
		    over it.

	And she does.  Moistening the full length of the cigar.  The boys
	are laughing openly.  She STRIKES the match.  As she lights up...

				GUY
		    I meant.  What you're looking for
		    in a man.

	She glances at his wedding ring.  Then, straight into his eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    Actually, I'm partial to married
		    gentlemen.

	The way she says that.  The guy swallows.  We can see some of the
	air has been sucked from the room.

				GUY
		    Why is that?

				JULIANNE
		    It's so much time.  When I phone
		    the wives.

	Explosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery.  As she jams the big
	Clemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over
	from across the room.  Without even looking at the guy she's just
	put away...

	... she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very
	dapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable
	interest.  He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather
	hassock.

				WALTER
			    (simply)
		    Your idea?

	She can't read this guy.  Maybe that's how he built an empire.  She
	nods, yeah.

				WALTER
		    You're a woman of insight.

	He sits on the arm of his chair.  Close enough to speak quietly.

				WALTER
		    My wife and I love this marriage,
		    and deplore its circumstances.

	He puffs his cigar.  Julianne puffs her.  Kimmy looks on, a kid
	watching the grown-ups...

				WALTER
		    As you guessed, my daughter is
		    unhappy about giving up her life.
		    And, in my opinion, cowardly in
		    avoiding the necessary confrontation.

	Then he stops.  As if reading Julianne's eyes.

				WALTER
		    Mike has a world of ability.
		    I'd do anything to have him in
		    my company.

	One more puff.

				WALTER
		    Except ask him.

	Julianne is a little stunned.  Kimmy looks helpless.

				WALTER
		    He'd resent it.  And me.  And,
		    most important, Kim.

	No smile on his lips.  Straight talk.

				WALTER
		    He's a great kid, but he's still
		    a kid.  Instead of recognizing
		    that his resistance comes from
		    insecurity, he'd turn it to anger.
		    To protect himself...

	Spreads his hands...

				WALTER
		    ... from realizing that he's
		    ignoring my daughter's needs,
		    despite how very much he loves her.

	He looks to his daughter now.

				WALTER
		    They both have some growing up
		    to do.  But they're good people,
		    they're starting with love.
		    They've got time.

				JULIANNE
			    (softly)
		    I think you're making a mistake,
		    sir.

	His eyes come back to her.  A little sharply.

				WALTER
		    And that interests me.  How
		    someone who knows him so well
		    could be so wrong.

	A formidable guy.  She meets his gaze.

				JULIANNE
		    See, I love him, too, as much
		    as anyone here.  And for a
		    whole lot longer.

	From her heart.

				JULIANNE
		    I think I know best what would
		    make him happy.

	INT.  TOILET STALL - DAY

	Julianne, fully dressed, sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat.
	The stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut.
	Her cellular phone pressed to her ear, she is listening angrily,
	smoking ferociously, every call in her body running at red-line.

				JULIANNE
		    Okay, okay, okay, okay, I hear
		    you, all right?

	She closes her eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    It is stupid, dishonest, desperate
		    beyond belief, and can't possibly
		    ever work.  It can only end in
		    humiliation and disgrace.  Now can
		    I say two words?

	Deep drag on the cigarette.  For strength.

				JULIANNE
		    Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
		    Do it! Do it!

	She's striped her gears.  COUGHS horribly.

				JULIANNE
		    All right, twelve words.

	INT.  PUBLIC RESTROOM - DAY

	Julianne exits the stall.  To face three BLACK TEENAGE GIRLS.  Just
	staring at her.

				TEENAGER
			    (supportive)
		    You do it, girl.

	Julianne nods to the kids.  They nod back.  Damn straight.  She
	exits the restroom, into...

	... glaring sunlight.  We are in the middle of the BROOKFIELD ZOO.
	And sitting on a bench, eating popcorn from a bag...

				MICHAEL
		    Wow.  What was going on in
		    there?

	She shudders.

				JULIANNE
		    Some crazy person.

	EXT.  ZOO - DAY

	Michael and Julianne walking together.  He's eating his popcorn.
	She carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle
	cone, and a large drink.

				MICHAEL
		    You're not eating.

				JULIANNE
		    I never eat when I'm serene.

				MICHAEL
		    You never eat when you're
		    despondent.

				JULIANNE
		    I switched that around when you
		    weren't looking.

	She swirls a single nacho chip in cheese.  But her heart isn't in it.

				MICHAEL
		    Last zoo we were in was...
		    Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos
		    were fucking.

				JULIANNE
		    Boy, those were the days.

	And when she looks over.  His eyes are waiting.

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    Yeah, they were.

	They're passing the hippo pen.  But they don't notice.

				JULIANNE
		    That was nice.  The way you
		    said that.

	So was that.  He's feeling restless, something.  Doesn't know quite
	what to say.

				MICHAEL
		    It's weird being the groom.  All
		    these things Kimmy has to take
		    care of...

				JULIANNE
		    You need a baby-sitter.  That's
		    what I'm here for.

	He holds her eyes.  Then looks down.  Awkward.  And the way he's
	doing it begins to excite her.

				JULIANNE
		    Say it.

	He looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is
	about to...

	... CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts.
	We have followed him as she is WIPED from frame.  His face from
	shock... to amusement.

				MICHAEL
		    Now, there's my girl.

	... to tenderness.  PAN back to see her wearing everything from her
	cardboard container.  Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works.
	It is really awful.  Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly.  Her eyes
	fill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...

				JULIANNE
		    See, I can only do it with
		    beer.

	He takes out his handkerchief.  And with that and his hands, gently
	scoops the worst of the mess off her.  The fact that he's touching
	her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice.
	She laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't
	know why.  Such an odd, raw, confusing moment.  To the world
	looking on, they are lovers.

				MICHAEL
			    (murmurs)
		    See, better already.

	And he kisses her face.  Not quite her lips.  But only an inch away.
	We can feel her heart pounding.  He strips off his shirt, only a tank
	top underneath.

				MICHAEL
		    We'll go back to the bathroom,
		    you'll put this on...

	Okay? She sniffles, okay.  Swallows.

				JULIANNE
		    Bet you're glad I'm here to
		    take care of you.

	He puts his arm around her.

				MICHAEL
		    Bet I am.

	Holds her close, as they start toward the restroom...

				MICHAEL
		    Hope that crazy person's not
		    still there.

	We're on their backs...

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    She doesn't scare me.

	EXT.  BEACH CLUB, LAKE MICHIGAN - SUNSET

	Julianne in T-shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling
	beach club.  Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene...

	... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party.
	Young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people.  We SCAN
	with her to find a crowd around...

	... a three-on-three volleyball game.  Kimmy and two groomsmen on
	one side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs.  The twins wear
	spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as
	predictably uninhabited.  As the next point begins, Kimmy serves...

	... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for
	Michael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless
	defense.  The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives
	him a savage...

	... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be
	proud of.  It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt.
	Laughter, applause.  The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a
	hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react.  Kim plays good
	sport.  Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then...

	... dashes off.  Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been
	set up.  Manned by beach club staff and family alike.  Michael's
	pop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg.  Kim's mom, Isabelle, is
	coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table.
	Julianne races across the sand to...

	... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs,
	clearly enjoying himself.  Julianne runs up to him, says something
	into his ear.  He looks at her.  Then turns his station over to a
	club steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside.

	CLOSE now.  As they stroll together, she's a little breathless.
	He's watching her profile, curious, silent.  At the water's edge...

				JULIANNE
			    (whispers)
		    Is anybody watching?

				WALTER
		    I hope so.  This is all too
		    mysterious to waste on just me.

	She reaches into her big bag.  Pulls out a single folded sheet of
	paper.

				JULIANNE
		    I picked up Michael's messages
		    for him, at our hotel.  I stole
		    one...

	His face darkens.  The easy smile fades.  He holds up his palms...

				WALTER
		    Julianne, reading my son-in-law's
		    mail, is not something...

				JULIANNE
		    Sir, this is important! Haven't
		    you ever in your life cut one
		    corner, to make something important
		    turn out right?

	His smile returns.  Just a little.

				 WALTER
		    Matter of fact, that's how I got
		    married.

	The look holds.  She thrusts the paper out.  He still doesn't take
	it.

				JULIANNE
		    It's a fax from Sports Illustrated
		    from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.

				WALTER
			    (quickly)
		    I know Ben.

	She opens the paper.

				JULIANNE
		    "Mike.  We still have no answer to
		    our E-mail of Wednesday.  Which
		    option do you select? I don't mean
		    to rush you, but Personnel needs to
		    tie up the loose ends."

	He takes the paper.  We see it now.  Looks authentic.

				JULIANNE
		    I think he's been fired.

				WALTER
		    It doesn't say th...

				JULIANNE
		    He's said some things over the
		    past few weeks.  Look, this is why
		    I came up with the idea of you
		    offering him a job.

	He looks up.  He's listening.  Closely.

				JULIANNE
		    And why I couldn't say anything
		    before in front of Kim.

	She bites her lip.  Seems so earnest.

				JULIANNE
		    I just think of how... desperate
		    he must be feeling.  He's marrying
		    a rich man's daughter, and he's
		    about to become destitute.  You
		    know the kind of job market he'll
		    be facing?

	He does.

				WALTER
		    And you think he's kept this to
		    himself.

				JULIANNE
		    He's too proud to beg for help.
		    And if you wait till this comes out,
		    your offer will be like charity.
		    Completely humiliating.

	He's staring at her.  But his mind is working behind his eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    If you do it now, it's like he's
		    helping you.  He can accept with
		    dignity.

	He taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.

				WALTER
		    This fax could mean... any number
		    of things...

	She nods.  She knows that.

				WALTER
			    (softly)
		    Maybe.  I should call Ben.

				JULIANNE
		    Then it could all come out, sooner
		    or later.  Nobody should be in on
		    this.  Just you and me.  Or, more
		    correctly, I.

	She takes the paper back.

				JULIANNE
		    What if, what if I could find
		    that E-mail?

	The long straight look.  Maybe he's hooked.

				JULIANNE
		    I never noticed.  Kimmy has your
		    eyes.

	INT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - TWILIGHT

	Tall, gangly, young DESK CLERK.  Lank hair, pimples.  He looks up,
	beams to see...

				JULIANNE
		    Hello, again.

	She's flirting her ass off.

				JULIANNE
		    You still haven't straightened
		    that tie.

	And she reaches across the desk with her lovely, slender hands.
	Does it for him.  Her fingers brush his chest on the way back.  We
	can assume a woody.

				JULIANNE
		    You know, my friend, the one
		    whose message I picked up...  ?

	He does.  His eyes flick toward his stately female SUPERVISOR,
	helping another guest across the way.

				JULIANNE
		    Well, he's still with the wedding
		    party.  And he asked me to get
		    something he needs real badly from
		    his room...  ?

	The boy swallows hard.

				JULIANNE
		    He's in 1526.  If you could just
		    let me ha...

				BOY
		    See that woman?

	Not only does Julianne see her.  The woman is looking back, while
	she's talking to her customer.  Not a pleasant look.

				BOY
		    She said, if I ever pull a stunt
		    like that again...

				JULIANNE
		    You'll lose your job...

				BOY
		    ... tear my pecker off.  Is what
		    she said.

	INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - TWILIGHT

	An elevator OPENS, revealing Julianne, carrying a gym bag.  She
	looks down the long hallway, sees a maid's cart.  Heads the other
	way, briskly, to...

	... a small ALCOVE.  Opens the gym bag, pulling out a bath towel.
	Begins to yank her top up OVER her head...

	ANGLE... the young MAID now pushing her cart down the hall, wheels
	SQUEAKING, and from nowhere...

	... Julianne DARTS into her path, barely covered by the towel held
	tight across her, she is grinning, blushing.

				JULIANNE
		    Help me!

	The maid can only blink.

				JULIANNE
		    I locked myself out, 1526, please
		    hurry!!

	And looks frantically up the hall, mortified that any moment a
	stranger could happen upon her predicament.  Her eyes dart back to
	the maid.  PLEASE.  The maid just stares.  Stares.

				JULIANNE
		    Uno-cinco-does-ses.

	Oh.

	INT.  MICHAEL'S ROOM - TWILIGHT

	Julianne alone in his room, looking around frantically.  No worries
	about this guy making his bed every day, stuff, clothes, strewn
	everywhere, the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated.
	She's tramping through a bachelor's debris, wearing only her towel,
	looking, looking...

	There it is.  The corner of his LAPTOP sticking out from beneath a
	discarded bedspread.  She SNATCHES it up, OPENS it, sets it on the
	cluttered desk, and...

	... stops.  There are wallet-sized SNAPSHOTS of Kimmy.  Some alone.
	Some as a little girl.  Some with Michael.  And next to them...

	... the plastic fold-out wallet inset.  That he has not yet quite
	rearranged.  So she picks it up.  Leafs through, until she finds
	what she was praying would be there...

	... Julianne grinning.  Michael's arm around her.  On the deck of a
	boat.  They have drinks in their hands.  Happiness in their eyes.

	And she stares at it.  Jesus, God, how long has he carried this
	around?  She flips through further, all the rest have her in them.
	Maybe half a dozen.  Her heart is throbbing.  Her eyes are damp.

	Back to the one on the boat.  She slips it from the plastic window.
	Holds it.  Then, gently...

	... puts it back where it belongs.  PUNCHES up the goddamn laptop.
	This is it, girl!  Do or die.

				JULIANNE
			    (murmurs)
		    You wouldn't change your
		    password, would you?  You
		    never change anything.

	Those words make her bite her lip.  Damn, I'm becoming a senti-
	mental slob.  TYPES in...

				JULIANNE
			    (murmurs)
		    Shoeless... Joe.

	Yes!  We're in!  Punching keys.  Letters flying across the screen.
	Okay, we're ready.  Types...

				JULIANNE
			    (reads as she types)
		    Mike.  I hate this downsizing
		    shit as much as you do.  But I
		    know this can't become as a
		    complete surprise...

	INT.  BEACH CLUB CARD ROOM - EVENING

	Through the window, the wedding party barbecue has extended into
	night.  Lanterns, music, lots more food, lots more drinks.  In the
	distance, on the sand, Michael is slowdancing with Kimmy.  Some-
	where nearby, the soft CLICKING of keys.  We PULL BACK to see...

	... a small clubby room.  Books, leather, polished woods.  Only
	two people here.  Walter, looking on stony-faced, as a determined
	Julianne grimly "struggles" to "find" what she's looking for in
	Michael's laptop.  And then...

	... she stops typing.  Looks at the text on the screen.  Her eyes
	sharpen as she "reads" what Walter can't see.  It's an Oscar
	performance for our desperate girl.  She turns the screen around...

				WALTER
			    (reads)
		    Mike.  I hate this downsizing...

	He reads.  Reads.  Reads.  All the air comes out of him.

				WALTER
			    (softly)
		    And Kimmy doesn't know.

	She shakes her head.  Nope.  No way.

				WALTER
			    (signs)
		    I'll tell her I've reconsidered.

	She nods, gravely.  Right.  He looks in her eyes.

				WALTER
		    You're a smart girl, Jules.

	She forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude.  But Walter isn't
	smiling at all.

				WALTER
		    Wish my daughter.  Bad your
		    guts.

	INT.  CHARLES TROTTER'S BAR - NIGHT

	The hot saloon in Chinatown.  Upscale, downscale, jammed, Michael
	and Kimmy at a small table in a far corner.  CLOSE on them...

				MICHAEL
		    Sure you're okay?

	She looks really scared.  Turns her drink in her hand.  Looking
	down at it.

				MICHAEL
		    It's not just a gag, huh?

				KIMMY
		    No, it's, uh... a real big favor.

	He takes her hand, tenderly.

				MICHAEL
		    I wish you'd just... come out
		    with it.  I mean why are we
		    waiting for Jules?

	She smiles up at him.  The best she can.

				KIMMY
		    Moral support.

	She loves him so much, and she is sick with worry.

				KIMMY
		    What's good of having a big
		    sister, if she...

	Stops.  Gestures with her eyes.  Because her big sister has just
	entered...

	... looking fabulous.  Julianne wears a long sleek sarong, slightly
	see-through.  Her hair is bound up with silver pins.  As she moves
	through the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make-up
	is flawless, understated.  When she arrives at the table...

	... Michael is beaming, admiringly.  He stands up.

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    Wow and wow.  You have a date,
		    after this?

				JULIANNE
		    Never can tell.

	He holds her chair.  She exchanges an intimate smile with the
	anxious Kim.

				MICHAEL
		    You make me think of that song,
		    we used to...

	And he starts humming.  The song is, "The Way You Look Tonight."

				MICHAEL
			    (singing)
		    Someday.  When I'm awfully low...

	They sit.  He looks from Julianne to his bride.

				MICHAEL
		    Okay, kid.  You're on.

	Kim's eyes flick to Julianne, who nods, supportively.  The kid
	takes a breath.

				KIMMY
		    It's really my father.  Who
		    needs the favor.

	His face sort of comes to a stop.  Nothing she can read, yet.  He
	nods, yeah...?

				KIMMY
		    He's... he's reorganizing some of
		    the divisions of the company...

	His eyes flick to Julianne.  She looks down.

				MICHAEL
			    (quiet)
		    He never mentioned that.  Neither
		    did y...

				KIMMY
			    (blurting)
		    ... and public relations is a big
		    problem area for him.

	She can see it now.  In his eyes.  She just can't tell how bad.

				KIMMY
		    He needs someone incredible,
		    someone really close, who he
		    can trust...

				MICHAEL
		    Like family, huh?

	So quiet.  So cold.  She is terrified.

				KIMMY
		    It would only be, maybe, six
		    months? Or three or four? It
		    would mean so much to him...

				MICHAEL
		    To him.

	She swallows.  Straightens her spine.

				KIMMY
		    And to m...

				MICHAEL
			    (sharp, to Julianne)
		    ... and you knew about this.

	Real quiet.  Against the noise of this place.

				JULIANNE
		    I think you ought to listen to
		    her, Michael.  This is her life,
		    too.

	Just the thing.  To bring that anger near the surface.  He turns
	to Kim...

				MICHAEL
		    Well, which is it?

	A demand.  Sharp.  Accusing.  She doesn't like that...

				MICHAEL
		    You gonna tell me Daddy thought
		    this one up? All of a sudden, I'm
		    the only jerk alive who can help
		    him deal with the press?

	She's trapped.  Angry, scared.  A deer in headlights.

				MICHAEL
		    Why don't you start being honest
		    for one fucking sec...

				JULIANNE
		    Michael!!

				KIMMY
			    (near tears)
		    I am honest!

	Silence.

				KIMMY
		   All of a sudden, I'm supposed to
		   drop out of school, forget my
		   family, forget my career, forget
		   all the plans I had for my life...

				MICHAEL
		    Well, forgive me for screwing up
		    your plans!

	He can't even believe he's hearing this.

				MICHAEL
		    I'm sure glad I'm hearing all
		    this now, before it's too late!

				KIMMY
		    What is that sup...

				MICHAEL
		    And what am I supposed to do with
		    my life, huh? I am 28 years old!
		    I work in a low-paying, low-status,
		    zero-respect job which,
		    unfortunately, I happen to fucking
		    love.  How inconvenient.

	Shrugs.

				MICHAEL
		    No problem.  A little bullshit
		    about Daddy's "needs," and presto,
		    I'm a lap dog in high society.

				JULIANNE
			    (softly)
		    Michael, it sounds like a
		    wonderful opportun...

				MICHAEL
			    (whips around)
		    Does it, really? How come you
		    never took some sell-out
		    establishment job? You had plenty
		    of chances!

	Glares in her eyes.

				MICHAEL
		    I'll tell you why.  Because that
		    isn't you.  And it isn't me,
		    either!  We're the same person!

	Back to Kim...

				MICHAEL
		    What a sweet little picture.  Mommy
		    and Daddy aren't losing a daughter,
		    they're gaining a eunuch!

				KIMMY
		    Well, if that's the way you f...

				MICHAEL
		    Damn straight, it's how I feel!
		    What's their wedding gift, a little
		    gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"?
		    Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?

	She's crying now.  Real tears on her face.

				MICHAEL
		    Great!  Tears!  The big equalizer.
		    You wait till two days before the
		    wedding to drop this on me, and
		    I'm just supposed to roll over and
		    drool!

	She is sobbing now.  She can't help herself.  Which makes him
	totally crazy.  He jumps up.

				MICHAEL
		    Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist
		    asshole, and you're well rid of m...

				KIMMY
		    MICHAEL!!

	A wrenching cry from her heart.  It stops him cold.  And before
	Julianne's astonished eyes, Kimmy reaches out a trembling hand...

				KIMMY
		    Michael, you are so...

	Choking back the sobs.

				KIMMY
		    ... so right.  And I am so very
		    wrong.

	Michael blinks.  Julianne blinks.  For different reasons.

				KIMMY
		    We can't go down two roads.  And
		    still be together.

	Her fingers stretch, beckoning.

				JULIANNE
		    Uh, Kimmy...?

				KIMMY
			    (ignores her)
		    We settled this.  And I reneged.
		    That wasn't fair.

	Please, please, take my hand.

				KIMMY
		    You have to forgive me, and forget
		    this ever happened...

	People are watching, staring.  These two see only each other.

				KIMMY
		    ... or I'll die.

	A frozen, forever moment.  He steps to her...

	... LIFTS her up in his arms.  Into the deepest, most heartfelt
	KISS.  And as she clings to him, people begins to APPLAUD, and
	whistle, and laugh.

	Julianne.  In her pretty dress.  Closes her eyes.

	INT.JULIANNE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Julianne in her nightshirt, her back to us, sobbing into her
	cellular as she paces the room...

				JULIANNE
		    ... see that's what I never
		    counted on! I never heard of
		    a brilliant moron before!

	We CLOSE as she WHIPS around, startling us with her grotesque day-
	glo PURPLE face mask.  The green was better.

				JULIANNE
		    I mean, the little twerp
		    GROVELED!!

	Losing it.  We know the drill.

				JULIANNE
		    SHE IS SO WRONG FOR HIM!

	Clutching the phone.

				JULIANNE
		    Michael and I are the same person!
		    Self-absorbed and imperfect and
		    vaguely loveable! We deserve
		    each other!

	Tears are flowing.  Which, over this mask, is not a pretty sight.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm out of hope, I'm out of sneaky
		    ideas, I'm at the end of my
		    rapidly-fraying hysterical little
		    rope!  Help m...

	She TRIPS over an open suitcase, and DISAPPEARS from frame.  The
	THUD is slightly alarming.

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    God, I hate this hotel.

	HOLD.  On nothing is particular.

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    And I hate talking to your machine!

	INT. JULIANNE'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

	REAR VIEW of Julianne asleep on the floor, sunlight streaming in.
	A soft knocking on a door, somewhere nearby.  She barely stirs.
	The knock becomes a strong RAPPING, and she fights for conscious-
	ness.  Her back still to us, she...

	... rises, STUMBLES to the door, which is now pulsing with an
	insistent POUNDING, and THROWS it OPEN, as we SNAP to...

	REVERSE ANGLE... CLOSE on Julianne's face, still encased in a now-
	decomposing PURPLE MASK, her eyes SPRINGING wide, she SCREAMS in
	shock, and we SNAP BACK to...

	ORIGINAL ANGLE... Digger, watching impassively at the high-strung
	SHRIEK.  In the silence that follows...

				DIGGER
		    You stole my line.

	He touches his face, and she realizes!

				JULIANNE
		    Oh, shit!

	Starts CLAWING at the overripe mask, but he grabs her wrists.

				DIGGER
		    Chill.  We don't want your face
		    coming off with it.

				JULIANNE
		    Chill?  Since when do you say
		    ch...

				DIGGER
		    When I'm talking to children.

	She looks in his eyes.  Realizing at last.

				JULIANNE
		    You flew all the way h...

				DIGGER
		    I noticed.  I'm on the noon back.
		    We have this thing with George's
		    family in the Hamptons.

				JULIANNE
			    (soft)
		    You're butting in.

	He still holds her wrists.  She brings one of his hands to her
	lips.  Kisses his knuckles.

				JULIANNE
			    (softer)
		    I really resent this.

	INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

	Julianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger
	gently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask.  A
	paleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact.  By the side of the
	half-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron.

				JULIANNE
		    What I mean, when I say annoyingly
		    perfect, is that there is nothing
		    annoying about her perfection.
		    It is vulnerable and endearing.
		    And that is annoying as shit.

				DIGGER
		    You like her.

				JULIANNE
		    If I didn't have to hate her, I'd
		    adore her.

	She looks up at him and WINCES, as the movement makes him scrape
	her face.  He's sorry.

				JULIANNE
		    Last night, she was crying, these
		    big, real tears, when she thought
		    she'd lost him.  It was like there
		    was a knife in her heart...

	Looking in his eyes.  Needs him to hear.

				JULIANNE
		    ... and I put it there.  I hated
		    myself, I grieved for her, I
		    couldn't enjoy one second of it!
		    And then, when it didn't work...

	Can you believe this?

				JULIANNE
		    I was devastated.

				DIGGER
			    (softly)
		    Go figure you.

				 JULIANNE
		    Because I realized.  When I see
		    him say "I do," that knife will
		    be in my heart.  And it will be
		    there every...

	She holds his wrists now.  To stop him.  To plead for
	understanding.  Forgiveness.

				JULIANNE
		    ... every time I think of him,
		    forever, which could be a lot.

	She almost choked on that last part.  So she composes herself.

				JULIANNE
		    You watch a guy caress his
		    girlfriend's butt.  You see an
		    Old Spice commercial.  Sentimental
		    moments are everywhere, when
		    you're in the right frame of mind.

	She swallows hard.  Fights for a grip on her determination.

				JULIANNE
		    There are 18,250 nights in the
		    next 50 years...

				DIGGER
		    You've been working on this, huh?

				JULIANNE
		    ... and having "done the right
		    thing" will only really be
		    comforting, oh, maybe, five,
		    six times.

	She sets her jaw.

				JULIANNE
		    This is my whole life's happiness.
		    I have to be ruthless.

				DIGGER
			    (quietly)
		    And you believe that.

				JULIANNE
		 	    (unconvincing)
		    Sure.

	His eyes are gentle and merciless at once.  No way she gets off
	this hook.

				JULIANNE
		    He was in love with me every day
		    for nine years.  I can make him
		    happier than she can.

				DIGGER
		    It's not his happiness you're
		    feeling guilty about...

				JULIANNE
			    (proudly)
		    I don't know the meaning of the
		    word guilt!

				DIGGER
		    Impressive.

				JULIANNE
		    I am breaking her heart in the short
		    run, but doing her a gigantic favor!
		    She would be miserable tagging
		    along after this insensitive doofus!

				DIGGER
		    The man you love.

				JULIANNE
		    Beyond reason.  The feminist
		    warrior will rise up in this kid,
		    and she'll be standing over his
		    sleeping form with a butcher
		    knife, selecting from a short
		    list of body parts!

				DIGGER
		    Someday she'll thank you.

				JULIANNE
		    Let's not get carried away.

	And the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features.  The real
	Julianne is glimpsed.

				JULIANNE
		    I'd settle for.  Someday, I'll
		    forgive myself.

	For...?

				JULIANNE
		    For doing this terrible thing.

	Her eyes tear up.

				JULIANNE
		    Which, by the way, I can't
		    figure out how to do.

	As the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering...

				DIGGER
		    Jesus.  You're supposed to take
		    your make-up off before you
		    apply the m...

				JULIANNE
		    I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY
		    GRIEF!

	Oh.

				JULIANNE
		    Guess what I brushed my teeth
		    with last night?

	He thinks about this.  Following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he
	browses for a moment...

				DIGGER
		    Zit cream?

				JULIANNE
		    I wish.

				DIGGER
		    Neosporin?

				JULIANNE
		    Try less appropriate.

				DIGGER
		    Ben Gay.

				JULIANNE
		    That was Thursday.

	He stops on that note.

				DIGGER
		    Elmer's Glue?

				JULIANNE
		    DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING
		    A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!

	She's hysterical.

				DIGGER
		    I give.

				JULIANNE
		    I can't even say it.

	Now.  He's curious.

				JULIANNE
		    A hint.  The first word is
		    "Preparation." Then comes a
		    letter of the alphabet,
		    perilously close to G.

	She reaches to test her curling iron, BURNS her finger, SHIT!
	KNOCKING the appliance into the half-filled sink.  She LUNGES for
	it, and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm...

				DIGGER
		    Considering the circumstances,
		    I'm not wholly against suicide...

	Huh?

				DIGGER
		    Just not by electrocution in
		    front of me!

	Oh.

				DIGGER
		    I've got this noon flight.

	He reaches to pull the plug from the wall, and now she LUNGES to
	grab his arm, slipping, her face falling forward, stopping an inch
	above the sink.

				JULIANNE
		    How do you know you can touch
		    that plug? Are you a licensed
		    contractor?

				DIGGER
		    What do you suggest?

	She looks from the plug down the cord, to the submerged curling
	iron.  And back.

				JULIANNE
		    Maybe they just seal off this
		    room.  They have others.

	He's staring at her.  Sweet, but intense.

				DIGGER
		    I didn't mean about that.

	Oh.  Again.

				JULIANNE
		    If I hear the words "tell the
		    truth," or any paraphrase thereof,
		    I dive into the sink and pull you
		    with me.

	Looking at her.  Looking at her.

				DIGGER
		    Let's go meet Michael.  I'll
		    wait downstairs.

	INT.  ARMANI - MORNING

	Julianne has cleaned up pretty good.  She sits with Digger on a
	fashion-fabric sofa.  They are side-by-side, studying something
	with equal concentration.  And slight concern.

				DIGGER
		    I suppose it's too late to
		    start over.

				JULIANNE
		    It's too late to start over.

	PULL BACK to reveal Michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a
	final fitting from a stylish fitter.

				MICHAEL
		    You guys are heartless, my
		    bride picked this out.

				JULIANNE
		    Like I said, dazzling.

				DIGGER
		    Is she going to dress you
		    every day?

	Michael smiles over.  Digger smiles back.  They live each other.

				MICHAEL
		    Yeah, it's in the contract.

				DIGGER
			    (softly)
		    Well, then, I'll take it up
		    with her.

	Michael motions, okay, c'mon over.  Digger rises, goes to Michael,
	the fitter steps back as Digger shows him...

				DIGGER
		    The cut here, here... this
		    line...

	Fingers lightly traveling over the lapel, the side-stitching, the
	cloth straight down the spine...

				DIGGER
		    ... trouser width, this is all
		    classic.  Which means safe,
		    something I'd wear.

				MICHAEL
		    I should look different.

				DIGGER
		    You should look like you
		    dressed yourself.

	Yes? Michael's grin is back.  Playful and friendly.

				MICHAEL
		    And I'm supposed to respect
		    your fashion tips, because
		    you're what, a New Yorker?

				DIGGER
			    (quiet smile)
		    Something like that.

	Julianne loves that the boy are getting on.

				MICHAEL
			    (means this)
		    Long trip.  Pretty nice of you
		    to come.

				DIGGER
		    Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted
		    to meet the one that got away.

	Said so naturally.  That embarrasses Michael, who looks down, his
	smile suddenly awkward.

				DIGGER
		    What?

				MICHAEL
		    I'm just glad someone finally put
		    this thing in its proper perspective.

	Steals a glance at Julianne.  She rolls her eyes.  What a goofball,
	my outrageous friend.

				MICHAEL
			    (to Digger)
		    Stay, huh?

				DIGGER
		    I honestly wish I could...

				MICHAEL
		    I'll call George's parents.
		    Tell them I need a best man who
		    actually looks after me.

	Julianne comes over.

				JULIANNE
			    (softly)
		    They'd say that's my job.

	She runs her hands over his jacket, smoothing it everywhere.  With
	tenderness that approaches transparency.  Glances back at Digger...

				JULIANNE
		    I'll take it home from here.

	Pinches Michael's ear.  Looks in his eyes.

				DIGGER
		    Two words.

				JULIANNE
		    Major.  Dish.

				DIGGER
		    Manicure...

	She looks down.  Michael's nails are unclipped, with layers of
	impacted dirt.  She touches his fingertips, a little more softly
	than she may have intended.

				DIGGER
		    Fly.

	Everyone looks down.  She ZIPS Michael up.

				MICHAEL
			    (to Digger)
		    You don't miss much.

				DIGGER
		    Part of being a New Yorker.

	INT.  HAIR SALON - MORNING

	Cutting edge salon.  Loud, PULSING MUSIC.  Digger and Michael in
	adjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as
	their hair is styled.  Digger's stylist is a hot trashy female.
	Michael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day-glo vest.

	Each man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a
	manicurist, so Julianne goes from one to the other, removing their
	cigars so they can exhale.  A seraglio feel to the way she does
	this.

	Now she's arguing with Michael's stork-like stylist.  We can't hear
	over the music, but she keeps tugging on Michael's hair, pretty
	passionate about her point of view.  Suddenly, she GRABS the
	scissors to do it herself, and Michael...

	... BOLTS out of the chair.  WHOA!

	EXT.  O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY

	Skycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty
	Japanese tourists.  A taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb.  Out
	jumps...

	Michael.  Opening the door for Digger and Julianne.  Digger says
	something, Michael gives him a strong HUG.  Julianne raises one
	finger to Michael, back in a second.  Leads Digger off by the hand.

	CLOSE on them now.  Alone in the throng.

				JULIANNE
		    Bye, handsome.

	Digger just stares at her.  Those maddening judgemental eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    You're going to say it, aren't
		    you?

				DIGGER
		    Tell him you love him.  With
		    all your heart.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm taking my next book to
		    Viking.

				 DIGGER
		    Tell him you've loved him for
		    nine years, but you were afraid
		    to realize it.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm moving this book to Viking.

				DIGGER
		    Tell him you're afraid of love.
		    Afraid of needing.

				JULIANNE
		    Needing.

				DIGGER
		    To belong to someone.

	He touches her hair.

				DIGGER
		    We all do, beautiful.  I'm sorry
		    about that.

	Staring in her eyes.  Even Julianne has run out of words.

				DIGGER
		    Tell him you know this is the
		    worst, dumbest, cruelest moment
		    to do this to him.  But there
		    it is, and he has to choose.

				JULIANNE
		    And what will he do?

	Digger isn't smiling.  His voice low, beneath the crowd...

				DIGGER
		    He'll choose Kim.  You'll stand
		    by her at her wedding.  You'll
		    kiss him good-bye.  And you'll
		    go home.

	He holds up one finger.  Almost touching her nose.

				DIGGER
		    This is what you've come to do.
		    Now do it.

	Wow.  She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time.  She
	kisses him on the lips.

	And walks away.  He watches her go through the crowd.  Take
	Michael's hand.  Lead him back toward the taxi.

	EXT.  SKYLINE CRUISE BOAT - DAY

	The skyline of Chicago moves past us.  Slowly.  The NBC Tower,
	Cityfront Center...

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    Big weddings are so strange.

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    You keep saying that.

	Up ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer...

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    Kim has all this stuff to do,
		    I hardly see her.

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    Well, you've got the rest of
		    your lives.

	REVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down
	the Chicago River.  Wind-blown.  Close together.

				JULIANNE
		    Getting your bed made.  Every
		    day.

	They smile at each other.  Seem so comfortable together.

				JULIANNE
		    You miss her, huh?

				MICHAEL
		    No.  I've got you.

	She nods.  That you have.  Staring in her eyes...

				MICHAEL
		    Don't you throw up on boat?

				JULIANNE
		    If you like.

	And she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly
	disgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air.  He laughs, as he
	pulls her back down to the deck.  Of course, it was all a joke.  He
	brushes back her hair.  Sighs.  Stares.

				MICHAEL
		    I've been thinking a lot the
		    last couple days.  About us,
		    actually.

				JULIANNE
			    (casual)
		    Have you.

	He has.

				JULIANNE
		    Well.  There's a lot of memories
		    to choose from...

				MICHAEL
		    It's more than that.

	That tightens her throat pretty good.  When she tries to speak, out
	comes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again.  Softer, this time.

				MICHAEL
		    I mean, it's embarrassing to
		    say it this way, but...

	He stops.  Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation.  So he
	smiles.  She knows how to put him at ease.

				MICHAEL
		    You've sort of been... y'know,
		    the woman in my life.

				JULIANNE
			    (straight back)
		    You've been the man in mine.

	Passing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge.  No one knows quite what
	to say.

				MICHAEL
		    And I was thinking this could be
		    our last time.  Alone.  Together.
		    You know?

				JULIANNE
		    Except for the hot affairs we'll
		    have twice a year.

				MICHAEL
		    Except for that.

	She's smiling so easily.  Who would guess her stomach is double-
	knotted.

				MICHAEL
		    I can hardly wait for your
		    wedding.

				JULIANNE
		    Me either.

	She watches his surprise.

				MICHAEL
		    Boy, I never thought I'd hear you
		    say that.  Can I come?

	She holds herself together.  Real soft with...

				JULIANNE
		    I couldn't have it without you.

	He's glad to hear that.  And then...

				MICHAEL
		    It's normal to have... second
		    thoughts, huh? To be scared.

	Is this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been
	praying for.

				JULIANNE
		    I wouldn't know.  I never had
		    that many first thoughts.

				MICHAEL
		    I mean, you commit to a wedding.
		    And then it seems like... this...
		    momentum, you know?  You forget
		    you... chose it.

	She nods.  Understands.

				MICHAEL
		    You and I.  I mean, in all our
		    relationships with other people...
		    We didn't use the word "love"
		    a lot, did we?

	We didn't.

				MICHAEL
		    Kimmy says.  When you love someone.
		    You say it, you say it out loud.
		    Right now.  Or the moment...

	Long beat.

				MICHAEL
		    ... passes you by, yeah.  She's a
		    smart girl.

	Off in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET
	of water across the river.  For Michael and Julianne it goes
	unnoticed.

				MICHAEL
		    We don't have a song.

	Hmm?

				MICHAEL
		    Kimmy and I.  We don't have a song.
		    Is that a bad sign?

	All Julianne can do is shrug.  Then...

				MICHAEL
			    (sings, softly)
		    Someday, when I'm awfully low...
		      And the world is cold...

	She doesn't want to cry.  So she puts all the strength she has into
	fighting it back.

				MICHAEL
			    (sings)
		    I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...
		      And the way you look.  Tonight.

	He stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile.

				MICHAEL
		    Dance card filled?

				JULIANNE
		    I'll check.  I have it on
		    powerbook, these days.

	He holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance
	with her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching.

				MICHAEL
		    	    (sings in her ear)
		    With each word, your tenderness grows,
		      Tearing my fears apart...

	She holds him closer.  Bites her lip.

				MICHAEL
			    (sings)
		    And that laugh
		      That wrinkles your nose,
		    Touches my foolish heart.

	He stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms.

				MICHAEL
		    Where did we first hear th...

				JULIANNE
		  	    (straight back)
		    The night we met.

	Right to his eyes...

				JULIANNE
		    The night we fell in love.

	He doesn't know what to do with that.

				MICHAEL
		    So we heard it... like, right
		    that... that first...

				JULIANNE
		    We danced to it.  Just like this.

	Just like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say...

				MICHAEL
		    I won't lose you, will I?

	Her eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his.

				JULIANNE
		    No.  Because I won't let you.

	INT.  WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY

	Julianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress
	shirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through
	the Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors,
	silent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for
	the custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear...

	... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a
	glass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting
	for five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into
	her laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass.
	A comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her...

				WALTER
		    I thought Michael was picking
		    me up.

				JULIANNE
		    I told him, get the important
		    stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect
		    the inconsequentials.

	Meaning, you.  They smile at each other.  Then...

				WALTER
		    Kim said, when he turned down
		    the job, there was no friction.

	Julianne thinks back.

				JULIANNE
		    Friction.  No.

	He smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing.

				WALTER
		    I haven't caused... a problem,
		    have I?

				JULIANNE
		    Nobody has.  So far.

	Her bright grin.  His eyes linger on it.

				WALTER
		    Well, you're a little early...

				JULIANNE
		    I need to make some calls.
		    Could I use... your office?

	INT.  WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY

	Julianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city.
	Closes the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is
	practically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant
	cherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She
	is stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there.

	Talking to herself, her own desperate support network...

				JULIANNE
			    (softly)
		    You can do this.

	Sacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each
	other.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The
	screen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach
	water.  She pulls the paper from her pocket...

	... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type...

				JULIANNE
			    (mumbling to herself)
		    E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson,
		    Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated,
		    from... Walter Wallace.

	And stops.  Her heart is thumping.

				JULIANNE
		    See, you can do it.  It's easy.

	Doesn't look easy.  Licks her lips.

				JULIANNE
		    You do it fast, it's over.  Like
		    it never happened.

	She sits.  And recites as she types...

				JULIANNE
		    Ben.  I need a favor.

	Here we go.  This is it.  Types...

				JULIANNE
		    My daughter's every happiness.
		    And my wife's.  And, least of
		    all, my own, are in your hands.

	Nods, okay.  Breathing hard.  Types...

				JULIANNE
		    Knowing you value our friendship,
		    and the... cooperative
		    relationship between our companies...
		    I am hopeful of your help.

	Touch, that.  Thinks.  It has to be.  Types...

				JULIANNE
		    I have offered Mike O'Neal, my
		    new son-in-law, a great opportunity
		    in my company.  This would also
		    enable my daughter to settle in
		    Chicago, near us, and pursue her
		    dreams and plans.

	Almost there.  Almost.  Types...

				JULIANNE
		    To his own detriment, as well
		    as ours, Michael will not accept
		    our offer.  While he works for you.

	She stands up.  Stares at the screen.  Walks away.  Walks back.
	Still standing, types...

				JULIANNE
		    My daughter joins me in this
		    plea for your cooperation and
		    discretion.

	Is there a SOUND?  Outside the door.  She HOVERS over the ESCAPE
	key.  Waits.  Waits.  Silence.  Types...

				JULIANNE
		    With gratitude.  For your
		    understanding.  Walter.

	She hits a KEY.  The screen goes BLANK.  The computer asks... DO
	YOU WISH TO SEND?  She tells the computer...

				JULIANNE
		    Are you crazy?  Get him fired?

	Types NO.  The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER? And she types YES.

				JULIANNE
		    Just till tonight when I bring
		    him back.  To look for...

	She glances to her huge bag.  Rummages through, pulling out a manila
	folder.  Lays it by the blank computer.  Fans out a few pages in a
	natural, disorderly way.  Takes a step back...

	And stares.  Struck to her gut.  But when she has done.

	INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Walter alone with Deidre now, signing a stack of documents, as she
	efficiently places one after another before him.  When he glances up,
	he sees Julianne wandering the halls.  Stands, tells his secretary...

				WALTER
			    (going through stack)
		    Off to rehearsal.  Send out this,
		    and this, not this, this, and...
		    that's it.

	Slips on his coat.  Oh... and by the way...

				WALTER
		    I'm holding four or five E-mails
		    I wrote over lunch...

	On his way through the door...

				WALTER
		    Send 'em out.

	INT.  CHAPEL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY

	Julianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL,
	pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows.  We now
	see the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe SUIT,
	tailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie.  Solid
	dynamite.  She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted
	nave toward...

	... Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by
	the altar.  Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an
	obvious flowergirl.  Coming toward us, up the aisle...

	... the MINISTER, early 40s, lean and quite attractive.  Mandy is
	HANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk,
	murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear.  He's a really good
	sport, and really uncomfortable.  Sammy is walking backwards,
	right in front of them, DROPS her bag, and BENDS to retrieve it, as
	if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display.

	Julianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice,
	until...

				MANDY
		    Reverend Dyer, this is
		    Kimberly's somewhat butch
		    maid of honor...

				SAMMY
		    ... Mr. Julianne Potter,
		    prominent New York drag queen.

	Today, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with
	none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower.  The minister
	extends his hand...

				MINISTER
		    Billy Dyer, Julianne.  And I
		    love the suit.

	She shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to
	Michael, now approaching up the aisle.  The girls lead the minister
	away.  Michael arrives.  Looks her up and down.

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    Takes me back.

				JULIANNE
		    Well.

	She smiles.  One that glows a little.

				JULIANNE
		    You sang the song.  Least I
		    could do was wear the outfit.

	He nods.

				MICHAEL
		    Except now you're better-
		    looking.

	Oh, yeah?  Yes, ma'am.  As she loses herself in his eyes...

				MICHAEL
		    I got the ring.

	He pulls the box from his pocket.  Somewhere, an ORGAN sounds.  And
	as he is about to hand her the box...

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (sing)
		    Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow...
		       Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot...

	Such exquisite two-part harmony, Michael stops to watch.

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (sing)
		    Comin', to car-ryyy
		       Me ho-o-o-me...

	It is amazing.  Soulful vengeful sluts.  He is enthralled.  Julianne
	simply impatient.  She wants his attention.

				JULIANNE
		    No accents today.

				MICHAEL
		    Yeah, Kim told me they were
		    giving you their Dueling
		    Scarlet's act.  Actually,
		    they're sophomores at Juilliard.

	She takes the box from his hand.  Opens it, as the singing CONTINUES
	throughout.  The ring is delicate hammered gold.  One of a kind.

				MICHAEL
		    Will she like it?

				JULIANNE
			    (whisper)
		    Yes.

	She's staring at the ring.

				KIMMY (O.S.)
		    My groom-person!  Your family
		    needs you!

	His master's voice.  He gives Julianne a smile.  And goes.  She's
	left with the box.

	Gazes at the ring.  Lifts it out.

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (O.S., singing)
		    Well, I look over yon-der,
		       And what did I see-ee-ee?

	Slips it on her left hand.  Ring finger.

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (O.S., singing)
		    Comin too car-ryyy.
		       Me ho-o-ome...

	Touches it.  Turns it on her finger.  So many emotions.

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (O.S., singing)
		    It was a hand.  Of a-a-angels.
		       Coming' for me-e-ee...

	Tries to pull it off.

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (O.S., singing)
		    Comin' for to carry me home.

	It won't come.  Not even close.

	INT.  CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT

	CLOSE on a bowl filled with squares of butter.  HEAR the butt of
	conversation from a rowdy, friendly joint.  Julianne's right hand
	REACHES to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then...

	... SLIDE the bowl into Julianne's lap beneath the table.  Her right
	hand MASSAGES all the butter into a gooey revolving mess.  We can
	pick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer.
	As, hidden from view, Julianne brings...

	... her left hand from her pocket.  Yep.  The ring is still there.
	The finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it
	off.  And as APPLAUSE surrounds us, Julianne...

	PLUNGES her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically
	TEARING at the ring, butter SPLURGING on her pants, everywhere, as
	we PULL BACK to see...

	... the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far
	end, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as
	team of waiters with heaping platters of CRABS, which they...

	... FLING across the butcher paper, as APPLAUSE continues from
	everyone but Julianne, who still struggles secretly.  As the waiters
	set huge wooden MALLETS in front of each guest, Joe O'Neal rises,
	POUNDS the table with his mallet for attention.

				JOE
		    Like to welcome ever'body to
		    our little rehearsal supper...

	He COUGHS, unaccustomed to public speaking.  Walter and Isabelle
	clap and call out support.  So Joe lifts his mallet...

				JOE
		    Okay, everyone stand up!

	And everyone does.  With one exception.  Trapped.  She JAMS her
	left hand in her coat pocket, SMEARS her right palm sort of clean
	on the underside of the table, GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP.

				JOE
		    To the bride, uh, goes the
		    honor... of cracking the first
		    crab!

	Everyone applauses by banging their mallets.  Joe RAISES his high.
	Everybody imitates.

				KIMMY
		    But first, a toast!

	And everybody SNATCHES up their beers with their left hands, as
	Julianne DROPS her mallet with a HORRIFIC CRASH, grabbing her beer,
	looking up to...

				JULIANNE
			    (on the spot)
		    I'm right-handed.

	A hugely embarrassing half-second.  Bailed out by...

				KIMMY
		    To our host, my cuddly Papa
		    Joe.

	All turns.

				KIMMY
		    Who taught me to play "Blue
		    Hawaii." On my nose.

	With a look at Julianne, Kim sets down her mallet gently, and
	performs a nasal HUM of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril
	repeatedly for vibrato.  It is charming, and everybody watches.

	INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER

	CLOSE on an actual, living, if geriatric, LION.  He blinks from his
	cage, bored as hell.  HEAR the surrounding noise, chatter, LOUD
	Sinatra music, of a very large party.  PULL BACK to see...

	... and overdecorated BALLROOM, in dim and dramatic lighting,
	dripping with the trappings of ANCIENT ROME.  The mingling guests
	are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party, most of
	them older women.  They are served by wandering well-built ATHLETES
	in Roman togas or gladiator costumes.  PAN TO...

	...  Julianne, still in her suit, hiding by a table piled with a
	carload of grapes.  Her left hand still buried in her pocket.  The
	eyes of a hunted animal.  From nowhere...

				MANDY/SAMMY (O.S.)
		    Boo!!!

	She JUMPS a foot, both hands FLYING UP, left one awkwardly slamming
	back into its pocket.  The girls have snuck up behind her.  They
	have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons
	wrapped around their bodies.

				MANDY
		    I know why you're scared of our
		    party.  It's too hip.

	Sinatra singing "Stranger In The Night." Hugely-muscled, half-naked
	black and white studs, serving enchanted blue-haired ladies.

				SAMMY
		    Kimberly wanted to tickle the
		    grandmas, so we figured, give
		    'em a cheap thrill.  Walter
		    supplied the decorative
		    touches...

				SAMMY
			    (points out the jokes)
		    Nose tackle from the Bears...
		    power forward from the Bulls...
		    defenseman from the Black
		    Hawks... my personal favorite,
		    the designated hitter...

				MANDY
		    ... I'm partial to the tight end.

				SAMMY
		    This is USDA Prime, largely
		    available, beef.  With no notice-
		    able competition, present company
		    excepted...

	Now they stare at her.  With identical, really odd, smiles.

				SAMMY
		    And yet here you are.  All
		    celibate and reclusive.

				MANDY
		    With those big, dark, haunted eyes.
		    As if you were harborin' some...
		    unspeakably... guilty... secret.

	Oh.

				JULIANNE
		    Well, I'm worried about something.

	Something.  Their expressions are deliciously, identically
	expectant.

				JULIANNE
		    Oh.  I left this really important
		    file in Walter's office.  I have
		    to send my editor some...

	Some...

				JULIANNE
		    ... figures.  On territorial sales.
		    To close my book deal.

	Uh-huh...

				JULIANNE
		    So Kim gave me the key.  And
		    Michael's on his way, to drive
		    me down to Wal...

				SAMMY
		    Oh.  We thought it was the ring.

	Julianne blinks.  Ring...?

				MANDY
		    The one you better get the fuck
		    off your third finger left hand.

	Ah.  That ring.

				JULIANNE
		    Well.  See.  That was a...
		    reflex to see if it would...

				MANDY
			    (helpful)
		    ... look good on Kimberly.

				JULIANNE
		    Right.  And then it didn't want
		    to come off.  Exactly.

				SAMMY
		    Maybe it's happy there.

				MANDY
		    Oh the way out of the crab house?
		    We asked Michael if we could see
		    the ring?

				SAMMY
		    He said you told him.  It'd be
		    safer with you.

				MANDY
		    An so it is.

	Julianne for once is speechless.  To our amazement, the girls wear
	identical smiles of kindness and support.

				MANDY
		    Shut up, sugar, he's on his way.
		    Let's get to work.

	INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Huge gleaming chaotic kitchen.  Cooks, waiters, working at top
	speed.  The three women RACE in, look around frantically, half the
	guys stop to ogle the twins.  CUT TO...

	ANGLES... and industrial-sized jar of peanut butter.  Julianne's hand
	PLUNGES in, halfway to the rolled-up sleeve at her elbow.  SMOOCHES
	it around, real good.  PULL BACK to reveal...

	... she is surrounded by the twins and six guys, all SHOUTING
	conflicting instructions.  Julianne FLINGS off the excess SLOP.
	Tugs for all she's worth...

				EIGHT PEOPLE
		    TWIST IT!  TWIST IT!

	Nada.  It won't budge.  A sous chef WIPES her hand with a towel, a
	janitor CRASHES a tool kit onto the counter.  THROWS it open, pulls
	out...

	... a spray can of WD-40.  Instantly, her hand is BLACK.  The guy TUGS.
	No movement.  He can't believe it.

				JANITOR
		    It's mental, lady, you ain't
		    trying!

	Sammy is rummaging through her handbag, pulling out...

				SAMMY
		    There is nothing so tight, this
		    can't help it...

	... a tube of jelly.  The letter K-Y.  Julianne just gives her a look.
	Mandy pushes through with a butcher's CLEAVER...

				MANDY
		    I saw this on Hard Copy.  People
		    cut off body parts and the
		    hospital sew 'em back o...

	The look has turned toward her.

				JULIANNE
			    (cold)
		    I saw the show.

				MANDY
		    ... well, maybe it works on
		    fingers, too.

				FLOWER GIRL (O.S.)
		    Aunt Mandy...?

	Everybody turns.  The little girl in the doorway.  Southern accent...

				FLOWER GIRL
		    Mr.  Michael's here.

	Everything gets real quiet.  Mandy takes charge.  She rolls down
	Julianne's left sleeve, RIPS the hem out of the cuff, so that it
	flaps down over her hand, covering the ring.  Sammy wipes the black
	stuff from Julianne's fingers.

				MANDY
		    Don't worry, baby.  You could
		    pick your nose with that finger
		    and Michael would never notice.
		    He's a man.

	The twins lead her off.  We're on their backs for...

				MANDY (O.S.)
		    Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's
		    marrying the wrong girl.

				SAMMY (O.S.)
		    You're much more his type.

	EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

	VIEW through a heavy glass door of the empty, dimly-lit lobby.
	PULL BACK to see Julianne, just as she...

	... KICKS the shit out of the glass! Almost breaks her foot.

				JULIANNE
		    I can't believe this!

	PULL BACK farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key
	ring in the heavy lock.  Sign over the door says WALLACE ENTERPRISES.
	Traffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering.

				MICHAEL
		    It's no big deal, she just gave
		    you the wrong keys that's s...

				JULIANNE
		    ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR?
		    A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL
		    TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S
		    GOTTA BE IN TH...

	And she SLAMS her whole BODY against the glass, making it rattle ominously.

				JULIANNE
		    WHERE'S A BRICK?  FIND ME A
		    GODDAMN BRICK!!

	She looks around wildly, hysterical.

				MICHAEL
		    What is the big deal about
		    getting this file tonight?

	A good question.  She needs a good answer.

				JULIANNE
		    I promised Digger I'd E-mail him
		    those figures.

	From his face, that wasn't it.

				JULIANNE
		    They are very important figures.

	Apparently.  He's just staring at her.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm up against a deadline.

				MICHAEL
		    Me, too.  I'm getting married
		    tomorrow.

				JULIANNE
		    That's my point!!

	Now.  He really doesn't get it.

				JULIANNE
		    I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be
		    busy with more important things.
		    So...

	So?

				JULIANNE
		    ... tonight's my last chance.

	He sighs.

				MICHAEL
		    I forgot how cute you look.  When
		    you get impossible.

				JULIANNE
		    It's just... up there... right in
		    front of Walter's... y'know, computer.
		    If memory serves.

	Helpless.

				JULIANNE
		    We could use... his computer, to...
		    just E-mail those suckers right ou...

				MICHAEL
		    Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing
		    business.  Crack of dawn, Monday,
		    Walter'll take you up there...

	Her eyes fill with tears.  He is mystified.  Smiles tenderly.

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    Give it up, kid.

	Touches her hair.

				MICHAEL
		    You can't win 'em all.

	And slowly, he takes her hand.  Leads her way.  She takes one
	backward glance at the locked door.  Her last dream dies.

	INT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON - NIGHT

	Michael and a disconsolate Julianne board the elevator.  He presses
	15, she pushes 11.  Michael carries a handful of messages slips and
	an envelope.  As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her
	chest, at the edge of tears.  He doesn't know what to do.

				MICHAEL
			    (gently)
		    Listen up, huh? Even if you blow
		    this deal, how big could it be?

				JULIANNE
			    (voice nearly cracking)
		    You're right.  Easy come, easy go.

	He's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset.

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    Jules?

	She won't look at him.  She wants to die.  The bell RINGS, the doors
	open to her floor.  She just walks out.

	And he follows.  They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip
	trembling.  She can't believe how close she is to losing it.

				MICHAEL
		    This thing means that much to
		    y...

				JULIANNE
		    It means a lot.

	He nods.  Okay.

				MICHAEL
		    I'll call the house, Walter's
		    probably not even asleep...

	Her mouth drops.  She can't believe this.

				MICHAEL
		    I'll drive you out there, we'll
		    get the key, we'll go back to
		    the office...

	She THROWS her arms around his, HUGGING him so hard, so close.  He
	laughs, she is so weird.  She pulls back, beaming, glowing.

				MICHAEL
		    Come on, we'll call from your
		    room.

	She claps his hand.  As they head down the hall...

				MICHAEL
		    If I fall asleep on the altar
		    tomorrow...

	He's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand...

				MICHAEL
		    ... you better be there to...
		    funny, these are all from Ben.

	She's at her door, turning the key.  He looks at the envelope.

				MICHAEL
		    The fax is from Ben, too.  Man,
		    it's my wedding, and my boss can't
		    leave me alone...

				JULIANNE
			    (entering her room)
		    ... maybe it's congratulations.

	He follows her in, opening the envelope.  Stops.  Reads.  And his face
	suddenly... freezes.  To stone.

				JULIANNE
			    (turning to him)
		    Michael? What ha...

				MICHAEL
			    (reading)
		    Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing
		    this to you on the night before
		    your wedding.  But I think you
		    need and deserve to know...

	And he looks up to her.

				MICHAEL
		    ... what you're marrying into.

	He hands it toward her.  She takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past.
	Toward the phone.

				JULIANNE
			    (reading)
		    I received the following E-mail
		    this afternoon... "Ben, I need a
		    favor.  My daughter's every
		    happiness...  "

	Her eyes BUG OUT of her head.  Holy shit! We can hear him DIALING the
	phone.  She keeps reading, it's all there.  How did this happen?

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    Isabelle?  I need to talk to
		    Kim...

				JULIANNE
			    (reading)
		    "Mike, the funny thing is, he's
		    offering you a gig you'd be
		    stupid to turn down..."

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    I'm just tired.  Please put her
		    on?  Thanks.

				JULIANNE
			    (reading)
		    "Maybe you should take the job.
		    And dump the girl."

	And when she turns...

				MICHAEL
		    Jules.  Could you give me a
		    minute?

	He looks more sick than angry.  As if the heart has just been cut
	out of him.  She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands,
	staring dumbly.

				MICHAEL
		    Please?

	She nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her.
	Now she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag,
	sinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door.

	She doesn't look elated.  She seems frightened, distraught, and
	most of all, confused.  Because she can't understand why.  She digs
	absently through her bag.  Cigarettes.  Box of matches.

	She lights up.  Draws deeply.  Somehow, she seems near tears, and
	laughs bitterly at that.  Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds
	herself.  Squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them.

				BELLMAN
		    Miss, are you locked out,
		    or something?

	She looks up.  A small, wiry man of nearly 60, in a slightly faded
	but neatly-kept uniform.  On his cart, a ton of bags.

				JULIANNE
		    No, I just stepped out, because...
		    it's a non-smoking room.

	And inhales deeply.  Leans back against the door, to look up at him
	more comfortably.

				BELLMAN
			    (politely)
		    Well, it's non-smoking floor,
		    too.  Maybe you could go to the...

				JULIANNE
			    (seriously)
		    Why don't you have me arrested?

	That wasn't sarcastic.  He doesn't know what to say.

				JULIANNE
		    I mean that.  Arrested, convicted,
		    put in solitary.

	Another puff.

				JULIANNE
		    See, I'm a dangerous, criminal
		    person.  I do bad things to
		    honest people.  This, see, this
		    smoking?  Tip of the iceberg.

	Waves her hand.

				JULIANNE
		    Make a citizen's arrest, I won't
		    struggle.  It'll be like getting
		    Al Capone on tax evasion.

	Now she seems angry.  But not at him.  Her eyes fill with tears.

				BELLMAN
		    Can I... Can I help you, miss?

	She squints at his nameplate.

				JULIANNE
		    Do you smoke, Richard?

				BELLMAN
		    Yes, ma'am, I do, but it's...

				JULIANNE
		    ... a non-smoking floor, yeah.
		    Well, you know what?

	And she takes the cigarette from her lips.  Turns it around, holds
	it out to him.  Go ahead.  He doesn't move.  Please! And so...

	... he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand.  Staring in
	her eyes, he takes a deep drag.  Savors an expert nostril-inhale of
	his exhaled smoke.  Hands the cigarette back to her...

				BELLMAN
		    My grandmother always said,
		    "This, too, shall pass."

	She swallows.  Wipes at her eyes.  Finds a smile.

				JULIANNE
		    Thanks, Richard.  If you weren't
		    on duty, I'd buy you a drink.

	He just nods.  She waves.  He waves back, pushes his cart down the
	hall.  As she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly OPENS,
	and she...

	... FALLS through it, flat on her back at Michael's feet.  Staring up
	at him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep
	drag.

				JULIANNE
		    What happened?

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    It's over.

	And crouches down.  Close beside her.  The cigarette drops from her
	hand, unnoticed on the carpet.  So he lifts it, crushes it on the
	heel of his shoe.

				MICHAEL
		    I want you to quit this shit,
		    it'll kill you.

	She just nods, obediently.  Okay, I will.

				MICHAEL
		    She denied it.  Said I was crazy
		    and paranoid.

				JULIANNE
		    A bad combination.

	He tries to smile.  It's really hard.

				MICHAEL
		    There's this big brunch tomorrow
		    morning?  At her place.

	He lets the air out.  Slow.  So he won't cry.

				MICHAEL
		    She said "How can I call everything
		    off, what do I tell everybody?"

	Shakes his head.  Can you imagine that?

				JULIANNE
		    Michael...

				MICHAEL
		    No, it's for the best, it really
		    is.  We were so wrong for each
		    other.

				JULIANNE
		    Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...

				MICHAEL
		    The job thing would have broken
		    us up, eventually, anyway.  She
		    couldn't have lived with it.  I
		    know that now.

	Julianne nods.  Maybe that part is right.  Maybe it would have
	ended anyway.  Maybe she can pretend she's not a monster.

				MICHAEL
		     And she's right, I'm crazy to
		     fall for someone.  I hardly
		     knew.

	Looks deep in her eyes.  He's so glad she's there.

				MICHAEL
		    Hey.  You still got that ring?

	She holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away.  The
	ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.

				JULIANNE
		    I tried it on.  But it won't
		    come off.

	He smiles at that.  A sad smile of friendship.  Then takes her
	finger gently...

	... into his mouth.  It is something like a kiss.  And when he
	removes her moistened finger...

	... he pulls the ring OFF.  Nothing to it.  She blinks.

				JULIANNE
		    It's mental, you know.

	He doesn't understand that.

				JULIANNE
		    Should we take a walk?  Or
		    maybe some food sent up, or
		    something...

				MICHAEL
		    I just want to be alone.  Is
		    that okay?

	She nods, sure.  He kisses her cheek.  Stands up.

				MICHAEL
		    Maybe I'll go back to New York.
		    Hang with you for awhile, huh?
		    Ben'll understand.

	She nods again.  Whatever you say.  He steps into the open doorway...

				MICHAEL
		    Or we'll go somewhere.  If you
		    have the time.

				JULIANNE
		    If San Antonio sweeps
		    Sacramento...

	They smiles at each other.  For real.

				JULIANNE
		    I've never been to Texas.

	Imagine that.  The look holds.  Just above a whisper...

				MICHAEL
		    Thanks for coming to my wedding.

	And then he's gone.

	IN.JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

	Julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her
	image with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver
	RINGING.

				DIGGER (V.O.  MACHINE)
		    Digger and George are with
		    family in the Hamptons until
		    Monday morning.  Brevity is even
		    more in order than usual.

	BEEP.

				JULIANNE
		    Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...

	Her eyes find the pack of cigarettes.  Next to her toiletries kit.

				JULIANNE
			    (softly)
		    I won.

	Her fingers touch the pack.  As if an object of significance.  Takes
	it up.

				JULIANNE
		    Amazing, huh?  I didn't do things
		    quite your way.  But... I got it
		    down.

	Cradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top
	of the pack completely open.

				JULIANNE
		    And forty years and nine grand-
		    children later, when I sit with
		    Michael on some rustic porch,
		    slogging through our sweet swamp
		    of nostalgic memories...

	Reaches the pack toward the toilet.

				JULIANNE
		    No one is going to sweet the
		    details...

	Turns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john.

				JULIANNE
		    Of one weekend in Chicago.

	Drops the lid with a CLATTER.  Hits the FLUSH.

				JULIANNE
		    Talk about celebration...

	She lifts a tube from her toiletries kit.  Stares at it, real
	close.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm gonna brush my teeth with
		    actual toothpaste.

	Turns it over, reads all the writing.  Yep.

				JULIANNE
		    I guess I'm too exhausted to
		    feel the elation I so richly
		    undeserve...

	Squeezes some paste onto her brush.  Carefully.

				JULIANNE
		    So I'm gonna hold calls at the
		    desk... while I get my...

	Start brushing.

				JULIANNE
			    (around, her mouthful)
		    God, it is toothpaste, they
		    should sell this stuff
		    commercially! Anyway, a girl
		    does need her...

	Squints at her image.  Laughs, spewing a little foam.

				JULIANNE
		    ... well, we're a bit past
		    worrying about beauty sleep.
		    Let's just settle for not
		    frightening small animals.

	She SPITS.  Tells Digger's machine...

			 	JULIANNE
		    Anyway, I couldn't have done
		    it without you.  Even though I
		    did, if you follow that.

	Wipes her mouth.  Stares off.  The eyes a little dreamy.

				JULIANNE
		    Three words:  Happily.  Ever.
		    Well, you know.

						     SMASH CUT TO:

	INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

	Julianne sprawled all over the bed, mouth open like a carp,
	sleeping mask against the daylight.  A sudden RAPPING at the
	door, and she...

	... sits BOLT UPRIGHT.  Utterly disoriented, until she pulls off
	the mask.  Stumbles out of bed, walking toward the firm KNOCKING,
	when...

	... it stops.  A message slip SLIDES beneath her door.  She lifts
	it, barely conscious.  This wakes her up.  In one.

				JULIANNE
			    (to the slip)
		    You're going where?

	EXT.  WALLACE ESTATE - DAY

	Julianne climbs from her taxi.  Only slightly in awe, she sets off
	past the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone
	and timber.  It's a hike today, because the circular drives is
	clogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for
	space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance
	trucks, catering and florist and food vans.

	INT.  GREAT ROOM - DAY

	Julianne escorted into an enormous room, where brunch is in
	progress for more than a hundred.  She looks from the vaulted
	ceilings, to the frescoed walls, the inlaid floors, the massive
	pipe organ above the stone staircase, the oil portraits of Scottish
	ancestors and their favorite dogs.

	Isabelle has risen from the main table, and comes to her.  All
	smiles.  Julianne is in the Twilight Zone.  What are these people
	laughing about?  Do they still think there's a wedding?

				ISABELLE
		    Jules.  We're so glad you
		    slept in.

	Takes her arm graciously.  This woman would make Anne Bancroft look
	coarse.  As they walk...

				ISABELLE
		    Now, you have a choice.  The idea
		    is bride and groom shouldn't see
		    each other on the magic day...

	Julianne looking all around.  Magic day it seems to be.  Where the
	bell is a bride or a groom?

				ISABELLE
		    So Michael stays put in the garden.
		    Kimmy stays in here...

	Pointing.  THERE she is, obscured by a cluster of the appropriately
	fawning.  She has the same hunted eyes and false, slightly manic
	smile Julianne wore yesterday.  This, at least, makes sense.

				ISABELLE (O.S.)
		    ... and the guests go back and
		    forth.  Where will you start?

	CLOSE on Julianne.  Watching the brave, frightened bride.

				JULIANNE
		    She looks tense.

				ISABELLE
			    (O.S., calmly)
		    Nerves.  I would never have
		    guessed.

	EXT.  ROSE GARDEN - DAAY

	A steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden,
	altogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic
	tables, where nearly a hundred guests casually dine, served by
	rolling carts.

	There, at the head table, Michael staring at us.  He looks like a
	poor attempt to cover a hard night.  She locks onto his eyes.  What
	the hell is going on? He looks helpless, miserable.  She gestures
	with her head, follow me.  Stalks off.

	EXT.  SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY

	Bronze abstract pieces, some quite large, face a huge set of
	children's swings, regulation playground size.  Julianne sits in
	one, moving slightly back and forth.  Trying to hold on to her
	temper and her sanity.

	In the distance, trucks are winding their way to and from the pond,
	where crews are setting up tents, lights, heaters for tonight.  The
	circus has come to town.  When she looks back...

	Michael approaches.  Before he can draw a breath...

				JULIANNE
		    I had the craziest dream last
		    night?  Walter and Kimmy had
		    asked your boss to...

				MICHAEL
		    Look, I came down here to face
		    everybody.  I didn't want to
		    slink away like some coward...

				JULIANNE
		    But the Scotch salmon was so
		    fucking good, you decided to
		    stay for brunch!

				MICHAEL
		    She hasn't told anybody, what
		    am I supposed to do?

				JULIANNE
		    Get married, apparently.

	She comes OFF the swing, PUSHES him back two feet.

				JULIANNE
		    What the hell are you thinking
		    of, the goddamn wedding is SIX
		    O'CLOCK!!

	He swallows hard.  Trapped.

				MICHAEL
		    This is her family and her
		    fault.

				JULIANNE
		    And your point?

				MICHAEL
			    (ten years old)
		    Well.  How come she didn't...

				JULIANNE
		    BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS
		    YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR
		    EACH OTHER.

	He just blinks.

				MICHAEL
		    Hey.  This is a serious matter.

	Thank you.  She POKES his chest, punctuating...

				JULIANNE
		    I'll be right back.

	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

	A modern take on the Medieval castle kitchen, towering ceilings,
	dark wood, copper pots hanging, a series of walk-in coolers and
	freezers.  The place is a madhouse of activity, as prep cooks
	slice, chop, sort, every kind of food imaginable, and delivery
	teams bring more.

	The girls walk through.  Alone together in the eye of the
	hurricane.  Kim choked with excess sentiment...

				KIMMY
		    Look at all this beautiful food,
		    so lovingly prepared...

				JULIANNE
		    They'll eat it anyway, you ever
		    been to a walk?

	Kimmy's lip trembles.  This is not how she thought of her wedding.
	The din is so horrific, Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat
	locker.  Even here, two BUTCHERS are dressing Eastern-fresh corn-
	fed carcasses.

				JULIANNE
		    You guys want to give us a
		    minute?

	The men blink at each other.

				JULIANNE
		    We'd like to be alone with
		    our pork.

	On that basis.  They leave.  Kimmy sits on a stack of packaged
	frozen fowl parts.  Stares up with big, sweet, wet eyes.

				KIMMY
		    How's he doing?

	Julianne cannot believe this.

				JULIANNE
		    Who?  The jerk who's running
		    your life?

				KIMMY
		    This must be... very, very,
		    hard on him.

				JULIANNE
		    What with the psychosis and
		    all, yeah.

	Leans in.  Listen...

				JULIANNE
		    When are you gonna come clean
		    with your folks?

				KIMMY
		    Don't you see...

				JULIANNE
		    If you're waiting for "Do you
		    take this man?", that's
		    considered poor form.

				KIMMY
		    ... that this is all my fault?

	Stops Julianne cold.  Your fault.

				KIMMY
		    Whatever delusions I drove him to,
		    there is truth at the heart of it.
		    I want him to work for my father.
		    I want to stay in school.  I want
		    a life of my own!

	Harder and harder for Julianne to push.  Her mouth is dry.

				JULIANNE
		    Yeah, well, lots of couples are
		    imcompat...

				KIMMY
		    I love him.

	Fragile and strong at once.  A plea.

				KIMMY
		    Tell him it's my fault and
		    that I love him.

	A long beat.

				JULIANNE
		    I'll be right back.

	EXT.  TENNIS COURT - DAY

	The court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's BALLOONS.
	There are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all
	directions, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread
	across the top of the court's chain-link fence.

	Michael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a
	prisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate.  From somewhere, we
	hear high, squeaky, alien voice-like SOUNDS.  Incongruous
	against...

				MICHAEL
		    How is she?

	Julianne absorbs this.  As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS
	around...

				JULIANNE
		    KNOCK IT OFF!!!

	We now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS, who have been filling the
	endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court.
	Clearly, they've been inhaling their working materials.

				  STONER KID
			    (Minnie Mouse)
		    YES, SIR!

	A Nazi salute.  When she turns back...

				MICHAEL
		    I asked you...

				JULIANNE
		    She admits it's her fault.

	He absorbs that.  And then...

				MICHAEL
		    Do you think she still loves
		    me?

	We watch the struggle inside her.  Her voice drops...

				JULIANNE
		    Sure, she does.  She's crazy
		    about you.

	Now tears stand in both their eyes.  The stoners are doing their
	Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing
	in castrato harmony.  But our two don't notice.

				MICHAEL
		    I keep asking, how can I explain
		    what happened? And I keep
		    getting that same answer all
		    night long.

	Which is...

				MICHAEL
		    I can't.  And it doesn't matter.
		    I drove her to it, because I
		    want things my way.  And even
		    if she did something tricky and
		    unfair... she was blinded by
		    love, okay?

	Julianne swallows.  For obvious reasons.

				JULIANNE
		    Does that make it right...

				MICHAEL
		    Love doesn't have to be right.
		    It just has to be love.

	The stoner are now helium-crooning "Bridge Over Troubled Waters."
	Actually, they're getting better.

				MICHAEL
		    She's giving up half her life
		    for me, and I'm bitching because
		    it hurts her.

				STONERS
			    (singing)
		    Sail on silver girl
		       Sail on by...

				MICHAEL
		    She's a saint!  And I'm a
		    worthless ingrate!

				STONERS
			    (singing)
		    Your time has come to shine,
		       All your dreams are on their way...

				MICHAEL
		    Tell her.  I'll marry her at six
		    o'clock, if she'll still have me.

	The stoners blend on the high note.  It's pretty moving.

				JULIANNE
		    I'll be right back.

	INT.  ORGAN LOFT - DAY

	PAN along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents.  Nearly
	twelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the
	diners in the Great Room, extending al the way to...

	... an organ loft.  Alone, above the noise of the party, Julianne
	and Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase.  Trapped
	between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth
	organ.  Dwarfed by their surroundings, Kimmy draws the hardest
	breath of her life...

				KIMMY
			    (whispers)
		    So.  What did he say?

	Julianne's eyes move over the young girl's face.

				JULIANNE
		    He said.  Marry me.

	Kimmy YELPS in her ecstasy, FLINGING herself against Julianne, and
	they go DOWN full length across the organ's pedals, BLASTING the
	room with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying
	disharmony.

	As grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy
	begins to...

	... LAUGH.  And KISS and hug her new sister.  And holds her tight.

	EXT.  WILLOW POND - DAY

	Julianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking
	POND, ringed with WILLOWS that dig heavy branches to the water's
	surface.  He is relieved, reflective.  Head down, he never notices
	that she is...

	... dangerously freaked.  Too petrified even to hyperventilate,
	we're lucky she's breathing at all.  We watch her life unraveling
	before her glassy eyes.

				MICHAEL
			    (never looks up)
		    Thank God you were here.

				JULIANNE
			    (mumbles to herself)
		    Oh, yeah.

				MICHAEL
		    I was so confused, so conflicted,
		    so... unstable.

				JULIANNE
		    Well, it happens.

	They pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking
	area.  Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans.  Everything
	that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.

				MICHAEL
		    I might have thrown away...

	Searching for the right words.

				JULIANNE
		    ... your one chance for true
		    happiness?

				MICHAEL
		    ... yeah, that.

				JULIANNE
		    You never want to do that, see,
		    that's always a... costly
		    turnover.  As they say in the
		    sport biz.

	There's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice.  He hears that
	now, and looks at her.  Maybe he can't tell she's frightened.  But
	he can tell she's something.

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    Are you okay?

	She stops walking.  She can't look at him, so she looks around.
	Across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly-
	colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and
	chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be
	strung.  At the center of it all...

	.... a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous
	swing.  He's maybe fifteen feet tall.  She points to it...

				JULIANNE
		    The Big Hurt, huh?

				MICHAEL
		    Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the
		    past.  And he likes the little
		    guys.

	So Julianne nods.  Because she does too.  Squints up at Michael.

				JULIANNE
		    Got a minute?

	He nods, you bet.  Worried for her.  What is this? She looks in
	another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached...

	... a stage that's been set up for the band.  Chairs, music stands,
	sound equipment.  A gleaming dance floor, already in place over the
	lawn.  Next to it, a shimmering white GAZEBO.  Like the centerpiece
	of a wedding cake.

				JULIANNE
		    Why is the dance floor by the
		    gazebo?

	She takes his hand.  They walk toward it.

				MICHAEL
		    Kimmy's idea.  She thought it
		    would be such a romantic place.
		    For our wedding dance.

	Looking down at her.

				MICHAEL
		    What's up?

				JULIANNE
		    Shhh.

	Up the white steps now.  Together.  The gazebo floor has been
	covered with hardwood.  The perfect place.  For a wedding dance.
	And Julianne...

	... turns, suddenly.  He almost runs into her.  She is staring up
	at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart.  He is caught,
	transfixed by the intensity in her eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    I have to say this quick, okay,
		    or I'll have this massive
		    coronary and you'll never have
		    to hear it.  Which you need to.
		    Does that make any sense at all?

	The coronary part does.  We can feel her heart beating from here.

				MICHAEL
		    Jules, what's wrong...

				JULIANNE
		    This is the dumbest thing I will
		    ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that
		    I can't.  I don't think.

	And then, she does.  She puts her hands flat on his chest.  Looks
	in his eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    Michael, I love you.

	A heartbeat passes.

				JULIANNE
		    I've loved you for nine years,
		    but I was too arrogant and
		    scared to realize it.  Now I'm
		    just scared.

	He stares at her, dumbstruck.  She moves even closer.

				JULIANNE
		    I know this comes at an
		    inopportune time, but I have to
		    ask this one really gigantic
		    favor, okay?

	Holds her breath.  And...

				JULIANNE
		    Choose me.  Marry me.  Let me
		    make you happy.

	And in a half beat of excruciating silence...

				JULIANNE
		    I know.  It sounds like three
		    favors.

	His eyes are loving.  They care for her.  She swallows, lost in
	them.

				JULIANNE
		    But when you think about it...

	Slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth...

	... to his.  The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer.  All of
	her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body...

	... a SCREAM rips the world to pieces.  They whirl to see...

	... KIMMY, halfway up the path.  Her hands across her mouth, as if
	to stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul,
	and...

	... runs.  Back Down the path.  Michael BOLTING after her, SHOUTING
	her name.  A frozen moment, and...

	... Julianne TAKES OFF after him.  All three running, SCREAMING
	their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop
	to watch from neighboring countries.

	Kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead.
	LEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT, just TEARING up the
	gravel as she ROCKETS out of sight.  No way to catch her.  Still...

	... Michael is racing for the cars.  Julianne, sprinting her guts
	out, losing ground with every stride.  Michael JUMPS into a
	Cherokee...

				JULIANNE
		    MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER
		    CATCH HER!!

	He GRINDS the gears.  She keeps RUNNING.  His engine FIRES.

				JULIANNE
		    SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE
		    DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!

	He BLASTS OFF.  She keeps going.  Gasping for air, clutching her side,
	she's dying here.  Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit!
	Next, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus!

				JULIANNE
			    (to the world at large)
		    DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS
		    ANYMORE?  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO
		    TRUST??

	Up ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee.  She still has a chance,
	DASHES to the next van.  BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome
	rendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the
	door open.  Stumbles in.  Keys!

				JULIANNE (O.S.)
		    THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!

	Michael SPEEDS away.  She KICKS the ratmobile in gear.

	LURCHES off.

	INT.  RATMOBILE, DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY

	Julianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep
	Michael's Cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular...

				JULIANNE
		    IT IS NOT GOING WELL!

	Down the block, Michael WHIPS around a corner.  We follow suit to see
	his destination dead ahead.  Union Station.  The DISPATCHER RADIO
	intrudes...

				DISPATCHER (O.S.)
		    Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie,
		    how we cookin' on that Skokiie
		    infestation?

	Now she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and
	screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder...

				JULIANNE
		    THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING
		    THE TRUTH!

				FIELD MAN (O.S.)
		    Copy, dispatcher...

				JULIANNE
		    OR EVEN PART OF IT!

				FIELD MAN (O.S.)
		    Uh, what happens if you got
		    that methyl-ethyl shit on
		    your hands?

	Michael RIPS into the train station's parking lot.  We SWERVE
	around a taxi, CUT OFF Harley, CAREEN into the lot...

				JULIANNE
		    GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS
		    NOT FAIR!

				DISPATCHER (O.S.)
		    Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds
		    before you're sterile.  For God's
		    sake don't touch yourself, or
		    anything.

	Up ahead, Michael is OUT of his jeep and running.

				JULIANNE
		    AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR
		    MACHINE!

	She SLAMS on the brakes, THROWING herself against the wheel.

				YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
		    Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra.
		    It wasn't bees in the gal's
		    wall, it was cats!

	She TEARS the door open.  SCRAMBLE OUT...

				YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
		    She says gas 'em, anyway,
		    she'll pay cash.  Uh... how
		    do I pay this?

	WITH Julianne now, RACING through the lot, Michael vanishes INTO
	the Station, she PLUNGES in after him, BOUNCING off bystanders,
	apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion,
	threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk,
	catching a lucky glimpse as he heads...

	... DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS.  My God, what's he doing?  A
	second wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down
	the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the
	concourse to see him, running for...

	... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she
	SPRINTS after him.

				JULIANNE
		    MICHAEL!!

	He DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up,
	pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS
	AWAY...

				JULIANNE
		    NNNOOOO!!!

	But he's just standing there.  His back to us.  Watching it go.

	Her body nearly collapses with relief.  She pushes herself on, but
	her legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she
	lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him.  He's still lost
	in thought, staring after the train.

	She tries to speak, but there's no breath.  So she puts her hands
	on her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog.  Wheezing, panting,
	trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually
	turns and...

	... JUMPS out of his skin!  A heart attack seeing her.

				JULIANNE
			    (croaks)
		    Don't speak!

	He just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure.

				MICHAEL
		    Uh.  I saw that moving...

				JULIANNE
		    DON'T SPEAK!

	FLINGING both her hands across his mouth.  A frozen beat.  He nods,
	okay.  Cautiously, she takes her hands away.  At least she has made
	him smile, in spite of everything.  At least she's done that.

				JULIANNE
		    I have to make a confession.
		    Another confession.  Besides
		    that I love you.  This is even
		    worse.

	This.  He's waiting to hear.

				JULIANNE
		    The E-mail?  You thought Walter
		    sent your boss?  I wrote that.

	You.  WHAT?!  Synapse overload.

				MICHAEL
		    You're not saying you actually...
		    you're saying that y...

				JULIANNE
			    (stricken with remorse)
		    ... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the
		    bad guy.

				MICHAEL
		    ARE YOU CRAZY?

	She nods her head wildly, hair flopping.

				MICHAEL
		    ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE??

	Bigger nodding.

				MICHAEL
		    ARE YOU ON DRUGS???

	Shakes her head, like a two-year-old.

				MICHAEL
			    (pacing in circles)
		    I mean, do you realize what
		    you've... well, of course you
		    realize, that's why you're
		    confessing, I mean... I mean...
		    how could you do that?

				JULIANNE
		    I didn't know it would get
		    sent.  I just wanted you to...
		    get mad at Kimmy... and...

	And watching.  As this begins to sink in.

				JULIANNE
		    I've done nothing but slimy,
		    underhanded, despicable, not
		    even terribly imaginative,
		    things.  Ever since I got
		    here.  Trying to...

	Staring in his eyes.  Eyes she can't read at this point.

				JULIANNE
		    ... to win you.  To win you
		    back.

	Tears in her own eyes now.  Big ones.

				JULIANNE
		    And I was blinded by love.
		    Like you said.

	Shaking her head...

				JULIANNE
		    But that doesn't excuse any
		    part of it.  I am pond scum.

	No...

				JULIANNE
		    Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus
		    that feeds on pond scum.  Lower.
		    The layer of mucous that cruds up
		    the fung...

				MICHAEL
		    Lower.

				JULIANNE
			    (agreeing)
		    Lower.

				MICHAEL
		    The pus that infects the mucous
		    that cruds up the fungus.

	And to her amazement.  The trace of a smile...

				MICHAEL
			    (softly)
		    On the other hand, thank you.

	She blinks at that.  Which squeezes out a tear.

				MICHAEL
		    For loving me that much, that
		    way.

	He shrugs.  Just above a whisper...

				MICHEL
		    It's pretty flattering.

				JULIANNE
		    Except it makes me fungus.

				MICHAEL
		    Well, that part I knew.

	She's never loved him more.

				JULIANNE
		    So you have to marry Kim.
		    Because she will actually make
		    you happy.  I, in contrast, am
		    a shallow, neurotic psychopath,
		    with relatively little to offer.

	Okay?

				JULIANNE
		    Kim.  Nod your head.  Do as
		    you're told.

	He nods his head, still smiling.  Her tears are running now.  Maybe
	she doesn't notice.

				JULIANNE
		    Just promise you'll never tell
		    me who you would have chosen.
		    If I hadn't confessed.

	She chokes back a sob.

				JULIANNE
		    Cos if you would have chosen me.
		    Then I threw away a perfectly
		    good life.  Just to be a decent
		    person.  Which is a questionable
		    trade-off.  Right?

	He nods, slowly.  Because he's supposed to.

				JULIANNE
		    And if you would have chosen
		    some 20-year-old punk over me.
		    I'd have to kill myself.

	Ah.  His smile keeps getting smaller.  More loving.  More wonderful.

				MICHAEL
			    (whispers)
		    I'll take it to my grave.

	Good.  She looks around.

				JULIANNE
		    I'm so glad you didn't jump on
		    that train, before...

				MICHAEL
		    I came here, looking for her.

	For her.  The words leave a silence.

				JULIANNE
		    Why would she come here...

				MICHAEL
		    This is where I proposed.

	Stares deep in her eyes.  She needs to hear this.

				MICHAEL
		    I had to cover a game in
		    Milwaukee.  She saw me off.
		    And when the train started to
		    leave... I jumped up on the
		    step, I help the handle, and
		    without...

	He grins.  Has to admit...

				MICHAEL
		    ... without a thought in my head.
		    I shouted, "Marry me."

	I did.  Now her eyes tear up again.  And she doesn't know why.

				MICHAEL
		    And she gasped, and covered her
		    mouth, and the train was pulling
		    out, and suddenly she screamed
		    YES!  Just once.  And blew me a
		    kiss.

	What a girl.

				MICHAEL
		    I never forgot that.

				JULIANNE
		    It's two weeks.

				MICHAEL
		    Almost three.

				JULIANNE
		    That is so romantic.

	Which makes him reach and touch her hair.

				MICHAEL
		    I just wonder if you know why.

	Do you?

				MICHAEL
		    It's because romance isn't
		    mystery, and tricks, and doubts,
		    and halting, unspoken longings.
		    That's not the real romance.

	Tears in his eyes now.  First time.

				MICHAEL
		    The real romance is saying yes.

	Does she know that now?  He looks at his watch.

				MICHAEL
			    (sighs)
		    Woulda been a nice wedding.

	Oh.  That.

				JULIANNE
			    (urgently)
		    You can't believe you've lost
		    her!  Sooner or later, you'll
		    find her, and you'll look in
		    each other's eyes, and you'll
		    see all that love...

				JULIANNE
		    Course, if it's later rather
		    than sooner, I'd hate to be you
		    at six o'clock.
			     (beat)
		    You've got a lot of explaining
		    to...

				MICHAEL
		    I'm just thinking of how she's
		    hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like
		    her life is over.

				JULIANNE
		    That's little egotistical.

	He glares at her.

				JULIANNE
		    But, undoubtedly accurate.

	She claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency.

				JULIANNE
		    Okay, we'll split up.  You go
		    to every romantic place you
		    guys have, I'll go... someplace
		    brilliant, and the first one
		    who...

				MICHAEL
		    If you find her...

	Strange tone.  A gentle warning.

				MICHAEL
		    The kiss.  May be hard.  For
		    you to explain.
			    (beat)
		    Because the only fear she
		    really has, is...

				JULIANNE
		    ... me, yeah.  And she likes
		    Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.

	Looks at her own watch.  Shit!

				MICHAEL
		    But if you do get to her first...

	She looks up.

				MICHAEL
		    There is something you are
		    authorized to say.

	EXT.  TAXI STAND - DAY

	Julianne sits on the fender of this guy's taxi.  The driver smokes,
	paces, while she waits for a connection on her cellular.  Then...

				MANDY (V.O.)
		    Wallace egregious residence,
		    Mandy speaking.

				JULIANNE
		    It's Jules, you guys haven't
		    had a call from, say, Kimberly,
		    have you?

				MANDY (V.O.)
		    Oh, she's slipped out, the
		    little monkey.  Prob'ly with
		    Michael, doin' the nasty.

	A shallow laugh...

				MANDY (V.O.)
		    Or crying in her nachos, down
		    at Comskey Park.

	Julianne's face SNAPS to alert.

				JULIANNE
		    Ex-cuse me?

				MANDY (V.O.)
		    I had this crank call?  From
		    some guy who thinks he saw her?
		    I said, what would a bride be
		    doin', on her wedding...

				JULIANNE
		    You are so right.  What a
		    nerve on that guy!  Bring my
		    dress to church, huh?

	Signals the driver, let's GO!

				JULIANNE
		    I want to pick up a little
		    something for the ceremony.

	INT.  LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON

	Game in progress.  Julianne and the bodyguard stand in the doorway
	of the deserted skybox.  Everyone Walter knows is going to a
	wedding.  The box is empty except for one cardboard container of
	nachos, extra cheese, sitting alone before a pulled-back chair.

				BODYGUARD
		    She wouldn't confide in me,
		    so I called the house.

	He sighs.  Feels terrible about all this.

				BODYGUARD
		    Luckily, I got her cousin.

	Julianne nods.  Yeah, big break, there.

				JULIANNE
		    Going to the john, she said?

				BODYGUARD
		    Could be there awhile.

	INT.  WOMEN'S RESTROOM - AFTERNOON

	Julianne BURSTS into the enormous chaotic restroom.  Looks around
	wildly, no sign of Kim.

				JULIANNE
		    YO!  IMMIGRATION!

	Everybody stops.  Pays attention.

				JULIANNE
		    I GOT A WARRANT FOR MS. KIMBERLY
		    WALLACE!

	Silence.  From the long line of stalls...

				KIMMY
			    (O.S., sobbing)
		    In here, you bitch!

	Now everybody's really interested.  Julianne ignores them, strides
	to the stall.  KNOCKS, like it's a door.  No answer.

				JULIANNE
		    Let me in, baby, or I'll rip
		    this damn thing off its non-
		    code-compliant hinges...

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		    GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY FACE OR
		    I'M GONNA MESS YOUR SHIT UP!!

	Some scattered APPLAUSE.  From down the line...

				KIMMY
		     	    (O.S., still sobbing)
		    Over here, nitwit!

	Oh.  Scattered laughter.  Julianne moves down the line.  Stares at
	the door.  We hear the soft, muted crying from within.  Slowly,
	Julianne...

	... drops to her knees.  Bends her head low.  PEERS under the door.
	What she sees, prompts a sad warning...

				JULIANNE
		    Incoming.

	And she crawls UNDER the door, on her belly.  We go WITH her to
	see...

	... Kim fully dressed, perched on the closed toilet lid, her knees
	drawn up, her arms around them.

				JULIANNE
		    Pitiful.

	And pulls herself up to her knees.  Kimmy tries to glare, but it
	just isn't in her.

				KIMMY
		    Haven't you done enough?

	The world gets real quiet.  An entire bathroom is listening.
	Julianne cocks her head to one side.

				JULIANNE
		    In one minute.  You are going
		    to feel so foolish.

				KIMMY
		    WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A
		    STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?

				JULIANNE
		    Have you ever heard of.
		    Irony?

	Irony? Kimmy sniffles.

				JULIANNE
		    I threw my arms around your
		    husband.  And kissed him with
		    all my heart.  Because I was
		    so happy.  For you.  Nitwit.

	And leans close.  As Kimmy flinches.

				JULIANNE
			    (whispers)
		    He's going to take...
			    (big grin)
		    The job!

	A stunned pole-axed moment.  And Kimmy's eyes SPRING open.  You
	mean...?

				JULIANNE
			    (beaming)
		    With your dad, yeah.  Can you
		    guess why?  Bitch?

	Everything inside Kimmy BURSTS free in a torrent of tears...

				KIMMY
		    HE LOVES ME!!

	And DISSOLVES, sobbing, into Julianne's arms.  A beat, for Julianne
	to reflect, and then she strokes her tenderly.

				JULIANNE
		    Well, of course, he loves
		    you.

	Kisses the top of Kimmy's head.

				JULIANNE
			    (very soft)
		    Hell, even I love you.

	Kimmy holds her tight.  From her heart...

				JULIANNE
		    I never want to go through this
		    again.

				KIMMY
		    That's entirely understandable.

	ANGLES... outside the stall.  Julianne's feet sticking out under
	the door.

				KIMMY (O.S.)
		    Shit!  THE TIME!

	The two BURST out of the stall, hand-in-hand, at a desperate DEAD
	RUN past us.  HEAR them EXPLODE out the door, and...

	... five stalls OPEN.  Women exit, crying.

	EXT.  UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - TWILIGHT

	A taxi pulls up in front of an ivy-covered CHAPEL, fronted by nearly
	a hundred souls, milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated
	curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety.  Our girls JUMP out of the cab,
	and half the crowd starts running toward us, twins in the lead...

				SAMMY
		    Whatever hap...

				JULIANNE
			    (cutting this short)
		    We were bonding, we lost track,
		    we're officially sorry, now
		    let's put it behind us.

	Kim WAVES at her mom by the chapel entrance.  And takes Julianne's
	hand for support.

				JULIANNE
		    Believe me, we got a bride who's
		    worth waiting for, yes?

	Everybody nods.

				JULIANNE
		    Out of our way.

	EXT.  DRESSING ROOM - TWILIGHT

	White.  Pure blinding white.  Across FRAME floats more white, this
	gauzy and ethereal.  It settles, its roots planting deeply in the
	bride's hair.  TILTS UP to...

	... the face of the woman who placed it there.  Julianne's eyes,
	appraising this bride we cannot see.  And so softly...

				JULIANNE
		    Don't worry, sugar.

	Don't worry.

				JULIANNE
		    When he looks at you, it will
		    be as if...

	The words stronger.  Because there is no smile.

				JULIANNE
		    ... he's never seen a woman
		    before.

	PAN DOWN the white until we are...

	CLOSE on the bride's perfect slippers.  HOLD.  And...

	INT.  CHAPEL - EVENING

	Begins to slowly PAN BACK UP the length of an exquisite gown.  We
	can tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that
	we are nearing the moment.  We reach...

	... Kimmy's hand.  Firmly clasping Walter's.  Keep PANNING, the
	bodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are CLOSE on...

	... the face of the bride.  Now we understand the word radiant.  We
	also understand scared senseless.  Our perfect, unflappable Kimmy
	is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic
	seamlessly blend.

	The organ's noddling stops.  Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small
	animal bearing a predator approach her thicket.  Suddenly, the
	CHORD.  The Wedding March from Wagner's Lohengrin.  Here.  Comes.
	The bride.  And we SNAP TO...

	FULL ANGLE... Kim and Walter.  This is it.

				WALTER
			    (whispers)
		    Left foot.

	REVERSE ANGLE... Kim's POV, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck
	craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to
	where...

	Michael waits.  Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness.  From which
	he attempts a smile.  Not comforting.  Kim's POV WHIP PAN the
	groomsmen, the twins, LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne, standing strong
	and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress.  She sends
	her little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle.  You
	can do this, kid.  So...

	... Kimmy does.  On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the
	world's intrusive admiration.  One step at a time.  The most beautiful
	she will ever be.  She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw
	up at the same time.

	And she's there.  At his side.  She glances back to her maid of
	honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net.  So
	Julianne...

	... CROSSES her eyes.  Which lets the kid smile and finally take a
	breath.  Have a little fun, huh? Kim nods, got it, turns to...

	The Minister.  Who stands before them with a calming presence.
	Thank God someone has done this before.  The crowd has hushed.
	The Minister's eyes are only for two.  His words are for all...

				MINISTER
		    Michael and Kimmy wrote these
		    words.  She asked me to confide,
		    mostly Michael.

	A ripple of laughter.  Gentle and fine.  They are setting in.

				MINISTER
		    So he gets to say them.

	A surprise.  A pleasant one.  The crowd adjust in its seats.  As
	Michael begins...

				MICHAEL
		    Why do people get married
		    anymore?

	And on these words.  We SNAP to Julianne.  Share her interest in
	the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    Why not live together amicably,
		    with no sense of obligation
		    beyond the moment?

	Her eyes.  She's listening.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    As long as the sex is good.  As
		    long as no one more interesting
		    has wandered into view.  As long
		    as the thousand conflicts of two
		    individual wills remain
		    comfortably compromised.

	PANNING now.  Other faces.  Isabelle.  Proud to the bone.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    And when one feels the urge to
		    move on, to explore the new.
		    No guilt, no disgrace, no
		    promise broken.

	Walter.  His eyes damp.  Against our expectation.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    No agony of having dishonored
		    a time.  When our hearts.  And
		    the world were different.

	Joe nods, as he hears...

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    Marriage is a lot to put up
		    with.

	Julianne once more.  No breath.  Rapt.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    The answer must be.  That there
		    is some need basic to the human
		    heart.  That embracing... the obligation
		    of commitment... fulfills.

	Her eyes have clouded.  As if Michael is talking to her.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    Some need to belong to one another
		    in a way which rages against the
		    notion... that all is impermanent.
		    Against the notion of mortality.

	And suddenly, ALL the feeling rises in her throat.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		    Our love is bigger.  And longer.
		    Than life itself.

	And the tears come.  They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed.  As if
	they were needed.

	Michael now.  Looking at his bride.

				MICHAEL
		    That's what we want.  And marriage.
		    Is what we do about it.

	Kimmy smiles at him.  With love bigger than life itself.

				MICHAEL
		    We are fools in this.  Thank
		    God Almighty.

	He is done.  There is a silence.

				MINISTER
		    Boy, that was good!

	People LAUGH.  The Minister holds up a sheet of paper.  For the
	crowd to see.  Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink.

				MINISTER
		    Michael and Kim also edited what
		    they want me to say...

	More laughter.

				MINISTER
		    The idea was, we're only marrying
		    once.  We have to remember it
		    forever.  Let's keep to the good
		    stuff.
			    (squints at the sheet)
		    You may kiss the bride.

	Bigger LAUGHTER.  The Minister waves this off, his little joke.
	Turns to the best man, pantomimes the ring.  As the hammered gold
	circle is handed to Michael, Julianne absently scratches her still-
	swollen finger.  Mandy taps Julianne on the arm, and produces...

	... a matching ring.  Take it! Gives it to her.  So Julianne steps
	forward.  Places the second ring into Kimmy's waiting hand.  Their
	eyes meet, and hold throughout...

				MINISTER (O.S.)
		    If anyone here can show just cause
		    why this man and woman should not
		    be married, speak now.  Or forever
		    hold your peace.

	Julianne CLEARS her throat.  Kimmy's heart flutters.  In the
	silence... Julianne's wonderful smile.  Just kidding.

	Michael reaches for Kim's hand, turns her gently to him.  Places
	his ring on her finger.  Holds her hands.

				MICHAEL
		    Kimberly.  I promise to love.
		    And respect and comfort you.
		    To hear your voice and your
		    heart.  Until we are parted
		    by death.

	She swallows.  Smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile.  Fumbles
	slightly, putting the ring on his finger.

				KIMMY
		    Michael.  I promise to love and
		    respect and comfort you.  To
		    hear your voice and your heart.
		    Until we are parted by death.

	Staring in each other's eyes.  A moment so fragile, the Minister
	waits an extra beat.

				MINISTER
		    For the record, you each agree
		    to marry the other?

				KIMMY
			    (quickly)
		    I do!

				MICHAEL
			    (smiling)
		    I do.

	The Minister joins their right hands.

				MINISTER
		    We haven't said much about God
		    this evening, I know.  But He
		    is here.  And He is happy.  To
		    bless His wonderful children.

	CLOSE now on Julianne.  For the inevitable moment.

				MINISTER (O.S.)
		    In that Michael and Kimberly have
		    given themselves to each other by
		    solemn vows, and the exchanging
		    of rings...

	Unnoticed by the world.  Her eyes are close.

				MINISTER (O.S.)
		    I pronounce them husband and wife.
		    Those whom God has joined together,
		    let no one put asunder.

	The eyes open.  Wet, brave, ready for...

				MINISTER (O.S.)
		    Now.  Kiss the bride.

	Julianne watching.  As Michael does.

	EXT.  WALLACE POND - NIGHT

	This is what all the preparation was for.  Tables, lights, balloons,
	the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo.
	The bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy.  Two who are one.
	PAN TO...

	... the stage, the band playing.  Julianne conferring with the twins
	and the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions.
	Then, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone...

	... KLUNKS it, for silence.  The band stops.  The dancers follow.
	All eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor.  She looks to
	the couple.  Just below her.  Then, to the crowd...

				JULIANNE
		    I'm a writer, too, not as
		    good as Michael.  But I do
		    steal from quality.

	She raises her glass.  Everyone at the table does the same.

				JULIANNE
		    This is to my best friend.  On
		    the occasion of his wedding.

	Shouts of support, a few whistles.  Silence.  She tells Michael...

				JULIANNE
		    If I have truly come to know
		    your bride as my new sister.
		    This is in her heart...

	She has to stop.  Swallows.  Because she will not let herself cry.

				JULIANNE
		    "Understand.  I'll slip quietly
		    away from the noisy crowd when
		    I see the pale stars rising,
		    blooming, over the oaks."

	Deep breath.  Looks in his eyes.

				JULIANNE
		    "I'll pursue solitary pathways
		    through the pale twilit meadows,
		    with only this one dream: You
		    come too."

	A hush.  SHARP applause.  From four hundred hands.  But not from
	his.  He is too moved.  Too understanding of what he has heard.

				JULIANNE
		    I don't have a wedding gift.
		    But this is on loan.  Until
		    you two find your song...

	And with that the band begins.  The opening phrases of a song we
	have come to know.  Michael seems overwhelmed.  Julianne nods
	toward the gazebo...

	... Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into
	his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to
	applaud an unscheduled wedding dance...

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (singing)
		    Someday, when I'm awfully low,
		       And the world is cold,
		    I will feel a glow just thinking of you,
		       And the way you look tonight.

	Soft two-part harmony.  As perfect as the words.

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (singing)
		    You're lovely.  With your smile so warm,
		       And your cheeks so soft,
		    There is nothing for me but to love you,
		       Just the way you look tonight.

	Julianne can cry now.  Because she's tied with half the place.

				MANDY/SAMMY
			    (singing)
		    With each word, your tenderness grows,
		       Tearing my fears apart...
		    And the laugh that wrinkles your nose,
		       Touches my foolish heart.

	Julianne begins to sing.  Unheard.  Unseen.  Even by the man she's
	singing to...

				JULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY
			    (singing)
		    You're lovely, please don't ever change,
		       Keep that breathless charm,
		    Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...
		       Just the way you look tonight.

	The band keeps playing.  The dance goes on.  Two people lost in each
	other.  The way it's supposed to be.

	INT.  GREAT ROOM - LATE NIGHT

	Bedlam.  Julianne caught in the middle of the throng.  A young
	couple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase.
	The SHOUT are deafening.  The bride has her bouquet...

	... she spots Julianne far below.  THROWS it her way, Julianne
	reflexively GOES FOR IT...

	... not a fucking chance.  The twins nearly TRAMPLE her in the
	stampede, Mandy WRESTING the prize from Sammy's grasp.  Everyone
	CHEERS, and then the couple is...

	... FLYING down the stairs, RACING through the crowd with a
	protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door,
	for freedom...

	... Julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple,
	struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty
	that she will never see him before...

	And then, he's THERE.  He has Julianne in his arms.  Holding her
	so tight.  An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad
	from the confusion alone.  Against the din, he murmurs in her
	ear...

				MICHAEL
		    Wherever I go.  However far...

	She sobs.  Holds him.

	Deep, deep breath.

				JULIANNE
		    You win a few, you lose a few.
		    Some get rained out.

	And to her surprise...

				DIGGER
			     (V.O., very softly)
		    You have a good time?

	To her greater surprise.  There are a few tears left, after all.

				JULIANNE
		    I did what I came to do.

				DIGGER
			    (V.O., even softer)
		    Good girl.

	She just can't speak now.  So she doesn't.

				DIGGER (V.O.)
		    I was thinking.  Maybe you might
		    visit us for awhile.  We've got
		    the room made up.

	This fucking guy.  God, she loves him.

				JULIANNE
		    I'll think about it.  I'm okay.

				DIGGER (V.O.)
		    Oh, you're more than okay.

	Just above a whisper...

				JULIANNE
		    You, too.

	And with the last of her strength...

				JULIANNE
		    If the sun comes up, I'll see
		    you tomorrow, huh?

	A chuckle.  At the other end.

				DIGGER (V.O.)
		     I'll play those odds.  You have
		     sweet dreams.

	We hear the CLICK.  She turns her back on the stars.  Shoulders
	straight.  Chin up.

	She walks from frame.

	FADE TO BLACK.  HOLD END CREDITS.

        Setting: MADISON, PENNSYLVANIA 1972

        CLOSE UP OF VADA

                                 VADA
                        (to camera)
                I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet 
                seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. 
                And i've learned to live with this chicken 
                Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the 
                past three years, so I knew Dad would be 
                devastated when he learned of my latest 
                affliction.
                        (to Harry)
                Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left 
                breast is developing at a significantly faster 
                rate than my right. It can only mean one 
                thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

                                 HARRY
                        (ignoring Vada)
                O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of 
                the fridge.

        FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE

        Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group 
        of boys

                                 VADA
                All right, who's in raise your hand.

        All the boys raise their hands except Thomas J

                                 BOY
                Are you coming or not Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't think so.

                                 VADA
                I knew he wouldn't come.

                                 THOMAS J
                I can't, I have to go home.

                                 BOY#2
                Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.

                                 VADA
                Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

        Group of boys enters house lead by Vada

        Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped

                                 VADA
                        (to boy#2)
                Hey, you didn't pay me!

                                 BOY#2
                How do I know you were gonna show us one?

                                 VADA
                You're such a baby.

                                 BOY#2
                All right, here.

        Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it 
        to Vada

                                 VADA
                All right, follow me and don't say a word.

        They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns 
        around

                You ready?

        They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the 
        coffin in the middle of the room

                You sure you wanna see it, or is someone 
                gonna go yellow belly?

                                 BOY#3
                I'm not chicken!

                                 VADA
                Okay. Lean forward.

        A tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and 
        the boys gasp as they look inside

                                 GIRL#1
                It's empty!

                                 BOY#2
                You're so weird!

                                 BOY
                I want my money back!

                                 VADA
                I was afraid of this.

        They begin to move into another part of the house

                                 BOY#2
                Of what??

                                 VADA
                Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not 
                completely dead, you know, like when they cut 
                a chickens head off and it still runs around 
                crazy.

                                 BOY#3
                You're full of shit.

                                 VADA
                I bet she's roaming around this house 
                somewhere.

        They open the door into the living room, where Grammoo is 
        in her rocking chair

                There she is, in the rocking chair.

        Pause, then Grammoo begins to rock the chair gently. The 
        boys all gasp and then all exit very quickly

                                 VADA
                Hi Grammoo.

        Vada seats herself upon Grammoo's lap

                                 HARRY
                        (in distance, from 
                        downstairs)
                Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?

        Vada gets up and begins to leave

                                 VADA
                Seeya later.
                        (kisses Grammoo on forehead)

        BASEMENT, HARRY & ARTHUR WORKING ON MR. LAYTON

                                 HARRY
                Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher.

                                 ARTHUR
                You took woodshop?

                                 HARRY
                Yeah, I made a tie rack.

                                 ARTHUR
                I made a tie rack.

        Vada comes down the stairs and stops just before the corner 
        that would allow her to see the corpse of Mr. Layton

                                 VADA
                Ahem.

                                 HARRY
                Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

        Vada places the packet on a stool

                                 VADA
                Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly 
                yesterday.

                                 HARRY
                        (completely ignoring Vada's 
                        comment)
                Ya, that rack holds six ties.

                                 ARTHUR
                I still have mine.

        Vada recognizes Arthur's voice

                                 VADA
                Arthur!!

                                 ARTHUR
                Vada!!

                                 VADA
                I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.

                                 ARTHUR
                Good for you baby.

                                 VADA
                Once you put the hotels on board walk and 
                Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.

                                 ARTHUR
                I like to buy off all the railroads.

        Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them

                                 HARRY
                Vada, we're trying to work here.

                was gonna make a fur out of 'em!

                                 HARRY
                        (to Arthur)

        Vada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in

                                 HARRY
                        (annoyed)

                                 VADA

                                 HARRY
                I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't 
                sing.
                        (beat)
                All right Arthur, just a slide of the 
                needle.....
                        (fades out as Vada climbs 
                        stairs)

        Vada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, CAUSE OF 
        DEATH - CANCER OF PROSTATE

                                 HARRY
                        (to corpse)

                                 VADA
                Sure, come on in.

        Vada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the 
        foyer, and sit down

                So, have you had the unfortunate experience 
                of recently losing a loved one?

                                 STRANGER
                        (puzzled look)
                Could I see your Dad, just for a second?

        Vada runs across to call downstairs

                                 VADA
                DAD, SOMEBODY'S HERE!!

        Vada runs back to the desk

                He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton. 
                Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate, 
                you're a goner.

                                 STRANGER
                Oh.

        Harry enters

                                 HARRY
                How may I... Help you?

                                 STRANGER
                I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day 
                regarding the make up artist job.

                                 HARRY
                Oh yes.

                                 SHELLY
                It's still available I hope?

                                 HARRY
                I think it's still available.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for 
                two years, at the "Dino Raphael" Salon, all my 
                customers cried when I told them I was 
                leaving.

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, Miss devoto...

                                 SHELLY
                I have a wonderful disposition, I put people 
                right at ease.

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at 
                ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a 
                Funeral Parlor.

                                 SHELLY
                They're dead?

                                 HARRY
                Yes they are.

                                 SHELLY
                Stiffs??

                                 HARRY
                        (for want of a better word)
                Deceased.

                                 SHELLY
                The add just said "Makeup Artist"

        Doorbell rings

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, excuse me a second will you?
                        (opens door)
                Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I 
                didn't want the burnished handles.
                        (door closes off scene)

        Vada looks out the window at Shelly's camper

                                 VADA
                Is that your camper?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes it is.

                                 VADA
                That's really cool.

        Grammoo walks past in a fixed stare

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Grammoo)
                Hello.

        Grammoo keeps walking as if she hadn't heard

                                 VADA
                She's shy.

                                 SHELLY
                Oh.

        Harry is standing at the door directing the men with the 
        coffin

                                 HARRY
                Just put it back in the display room fellers.

                                 MEN
                Okay Harry.

        The men move off, Vada walks over to Harry

                                 VADA
                Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?

                                 HARRY
                They come in all sizes honey, just like 
                shoes.

                                 VADA
                Is it for a child?

        Harry hesitates

                                 HARRY
                Of course not.

                                 VADA
                Then who's it for?

        Small pause while Harry thinks of a reply

                                 HARRY
                Short people, very short people.

        Shelly walks over to Harry

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me, what about the job?

                                 HARRY
                Pardon?

                                 SHELLY
                I need the job.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...

                                 SHELLY
                Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my 
                former clients will eventually die, and all 
                your clients used to be alive, so they have 
                something in common.

                                 HARRY
                You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering 
                the phone.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.

                                 HARRY
                Great, you can start right away. Call me 
                Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally 
                wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, 
                very much, but the....

                                 SHELLY
                I promise i'll take good care of these 
                people, they deserve it, they're dead, all 
                they've got left is their looks.

        Harry and Vada exchange weird looks

        OUTSIDE SHOPPING MALL-AREA DAY

        Vada and Thomas J are riding their bikes through town

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey look at this, no feet!

                                 VADA
                Oh wow, a real evil canieval.

        Vada and Thomas J ride up through a garage

                                 PSYCHO MECHANIC
                WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY GARAGE, GET 
                OUTTA HERE!!!

        Vada and Thomas J arrive outside the entrance to the 
        Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a 
        small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room

        INSIDE DOCTOR WELTY'S WAITING ROOM

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Hi Vada, what's wrong today?

                                 VADA
                I'm very sick.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor 
                can see you.

        She picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the 
        doctor

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in?

        Vada opens door to doctors surgery and enters

        OVER DR WELTY'S SHOULDER, CLOSE UP OF VADA HAVING HER EAR 
        EXAMINED

                                 VADA
                Well, what is it? I can handle it.

                                 DR WELTY
                You are perfectly healthy.

                                 VADA
                That can't be, I have all the classic 
                symptoms.

                                 DR WELTY
                Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your 
                house today?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada you've gotta stop this, there's 
                absolutely nothing wrong with you!

        Vada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door, 
        stopping and says with condescending intonation...

                                 VADA
                I'll just have to get a second opinion.

        OUTSIDE DOCTORS SURGERY DAY

        Vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike

                                 THOMAS J
                So, what'd he say was wrong with you?

        Vada is turning and beginning to ride away

                                 VADA
                The whole medical profession is a crack.

        Thomas J is trying to catch up

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey wait up for me!

        BIKE RIDE DOWN MAIN STREET IN TOWN

        VADA & THOMAS J ARE SINGING

        Vada slows down, stops and looks at a person on a ladder 
        painting a house

                                 VADA
                Hey look!

        Thomas J stops also

                                 THOMAS J
                At what?

                                 VADA
                That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!

                                 VADA
                Hi Mr. Bixler!

        Mr. Bixler turns around and sees Vada and Thomas J

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. 
                J! How's the summer treating you?

                                 VADA
                It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the 
                books for summer reading.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Really? Already? The summer's just begun.

                                 VADA
                Yes, and now I'm reading War & Peace for fun.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about 
                you Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I haven't started yet.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Better get on his case Vada.

        Mr. Bixler gets down off his ladder

                                 VADA
                Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old 
                house?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.

                                 VADA
                This is one big house for one single person.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well, you never can tell...
                        (Vada gets worried look on 
                        her face)
                I might get a pet.
                        (Vada's expression relaxes, 
                        she smiles)

                                 VADA
                How are you gonna get the money for this old 
                house if you're not working?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this 
                summer, so, I'm doing some work.

                                 VADA
                How much does it cost?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Thirty five dollars.

                                 VADA
                What do you get for that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. 
                This an interrogation Vada?

                                 VADA
                No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off 
                War & Peace.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                It's summer! You're kids! Go play!

        Vada and Thomas J ride off down street

        SIDE ON SHOT OF VADA AND THOMAS J RIDING DOWN STREET, 
        CAMERA IS MOVING WITH THEM

                                 THOMAS J
                Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some 
                peaches?

                                 VADA
                No, I'm going home.

                                 THOMAS J
                Why? It's not dinner time yet.

                                 VADA
                Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go 
                home to eat.

        Vada accelerates leaving Thomas J in her tracks

                Don't pee on the hydrant!!

        VADA'S BEDROOM

        Vada puts a record on to play.
                        (song is "Wedding Bell 
                        Blues")
        She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph, 
        with Mr. Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape. Music begins to 
        play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking 
        at the photo longingly

        SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON THE 
        FLOOR SPRAWLED OUT, HARRY AND PHIL ARE HAVING A 
        CONVERSATION, AND GRAMMOO IS SITTING STARING INTO SPACE, 
        SHELLY ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's 
                hair. He kinda looked......
                        (she sees Vada lying down 
                        sprawled out on the floor)
                Harry, what's wrong with her??

                                 HARRY
                Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here 
                and eat your broccoli!

        Shelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada

                                 VADA
                        (very sick sounding voice)
                I think it's my prostate.

        All of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing

                                 GRAMMOO
                I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who 
                could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in 
                green pastures, I got my man, who could ask 
                for anything more?

        As this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a VERY 
        weird expression, this is too much for her

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J SITTING ON STEPS 
        DAY

        Shelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then 
        crouches down beside Vada and Thomas J

                                 SHELLY
                Who's winning?

                                 VADA
                I am.

        As Vada and Thomas J continue to play, three Vada-aged 
        girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway

                                 GIRL#1
                Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND
                        (very mocking voice)

                                 VADA
                He is not my boyfriend!

                                 GIRL#2
                I bet she kissed him on the lips!

                                 VADA
                Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yeah anyway.

                                 GIRL#2
                Come on let's go.

                                 GIRL#1 & GIRL#2
                Judy's father owns the movie theater and we 
                get to see all the movies WE want for free.

                                 JUDY
                Maybe you can come some time.

                                 GUY#2
                Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to 
                bring her boyfriend.

        The two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly 
        looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends

                                 GIRL#2
                        (together)
                Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-
                I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage, 
                then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage.

        Judy wanders off screen, looking sorry for Vada

                                 SHELLY
                You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls 
                upset you.

                                 VADA
                I'm not upset. I will never play with those 
                girls. I only surround myself with people who 
                I find intellectually stimulating.

        Thomas J looks at Shelly and smiles, he is proud to be the 
        friend of such an intelligent girl

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Vada)
                Want a piece of chocolate?

        Vada shakes her head

                                 SHELLY
                Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm allergic to it.

                                 SHELLY
                To chocolate?

                                 VADA
                He's allergic to everything.

                                 SHELLY
                Chocolate?

                                 VADA & THOMAS J
                TO EVERYTHING.

        Shelly notices a ring that Vada is wearing on her right 
        index finger

                                 SHELLY
                Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.

                                 VADA
                It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.

                                 THOMAS J
                It doesn't work, it always stays black.
                        (NOTE ring is BLACK)

                                 VADA
                It's only black when you're around 'cause you 
                put me in a bad mood.

                                 SHELLY
                Maybe black means you're happy?

                                 VADA
                I don't think so.
                        (pause)
                Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?

                                 THOMAS J
                She's crazy, she wants to go to school over 
                the summer.

                                 VADA
                It's not a real school, it's a writing class, 
                I wanna be a writer.

                                 THOMAS J
                She only wants to do it because her sweetie 
                pie's the teacher.

        Vada is annoyed that Shelly now knows her little secret and 
        pushes Thomas J

                                 VADA
                Shut your big fat mouth!

                                 SHELLY
                I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask 
                your Dad?

                                 VADA
                He won't give it to me.

                                 SHELLY
                Well you don't know that. Ask him.

        SULTENFUSS' LIVING ROOM, GRAMMOO AND HARRY WATCHING TV, 
        VADA ENTERS

        Vada passes Grammoo and Harry who are watching a TV show, 
        she then seats herself next to Harry

                                 VADA
                Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?

                                 HARRY
                That's a lot of money for a little girl.

                                 VADA
                It's for school, for summer writing class.

                                 HARRY
                        (engrossed with TV show)
                Any more soda left?

        Vada pours Harry another soda

                                 VADA
                Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

                                 HARRY
                Last month you wanted to play the violin. 
                Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

        Harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the TV 
        screen

                                 VADA
                Dad?

                                 HARRY
                        (referring to TV)
                I love this guy!
                        (he laughs)

                                 VADA
                Dad??

                                 HARRY
                What?

                                 VADA
                The money?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, maybe next summer.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                He forgot about the time I wanted to be a 
                magician, I was really great at making myself 
                disappear.

        FOYER OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA BOUNCING BASKET-BALL, 
        ARTHUR ENTERS

                                 VADA
                Wanna play?

                                 ARTHUR
                No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your 
                head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

        Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a 
        demonstration

                See. You were looking at the ball. All right? 
                Keep your head up. Gimme some skin,

        They both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands, 
        Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which 
        accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the 
        basement

        SCARY MUSIC

        Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the 
        corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the 
        corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the 
        ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking 
        through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut 
        unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and 
        tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts 
        to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the 
        noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits 
        on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on 
        the step

                                 SHELLY
                Vada? VADA?? What happened??

                                 VADA
                        (extremely frightened and 
                        timid)
                My ball, I lost my ball.

                                 SHELLY
                        (picking Vada up onto her 
                        feet)
                Come on sweetie.

        The two exit the scene

        SHELLY PUTTING MAKEUP ON DEAD LADY, BASEMENT OF SULTENFUSS' 
        HOUSE

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry?

                                 HARRY
                Uh huh?

                                 SHELLY
                Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?

                                 HARRY
                Yeah.

        Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and 
        observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed

                Didn't I give you a picture of what she 
                looked like?

                                 SHELLY
                Yeah,
                        (searches pockets, eventually 
                        pulling out a photo)

        Harry compares photo with Mrs. Porter's face

                                 SHELLY
                You don't like it?

                                 HARRY
                This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have 
                her looking like a two dollar hooker.

                                 SHELLY
                        (a little offended)
                I think she looks nice! Her lips are very 
                thin so I used the gloss to give them a more 
                sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a 
                little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, 
                nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.

                                 HARRY
                She did. This photo was taken a month ago at 
                the church food drive.

                                 SHELLY
                I just wanted to get past this "old school 
                Marm" image.

                                 HARRY
                That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school 
                Marm.
                        (beat)
                Fix it.

        Harry begins to leave

                                 SHELLY
                Harry?
                        (Harry stops and turns 
                        around)
                I was just wondering, if there is anything 
                wrong with Vada.

                                 HARRY
                What do you mean??

                                 SHELLY
                Well the other night at dinner...

                                 HARRY
                Oh that, she just likes to play.

                                 SHELLY
                I don't think so, I think she's confused 
                about death.

                                 HARRY
                She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a 
                thing or two about it.

                                 SHELLY
                Harry, I really think she.....

                                 HARRY
                        (annoyed)
                She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, 
                look, don't give me any advice about my 
                daughter, okay?

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE TURNING A 
        SKIPPING ROPE AND PHIL IS JUMPING IN IT PUFFING AWAY, VADA & 
        THOMAS J ARE SAYING A RHYME THAT GOES WITH SKIPPING GAMES, 
        SHELLY PULLS UP IN HER CAMPER

                                 VADA
                There's Shelly!

        Vada and Thomas J stop turning the rope leaving Phil 
        standing there exhausted, and run over to Shelly's camper, 
        Shelly gets out

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 VADA
                Can we look around in your camper?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.

        Vada and Thomas J rush inside the camper

                        (surprised at Vada and Thomas 
                        J's eagerness to get inside)
                Woah! Gosh!

        Thomas J seats himself at the drivers seat and makes "vroom 
        vroom" noises, Vada sits at the table, selects a book from a 
        small bookshelf on the side, and begins to read it

                                 THOMAS J
                Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you 
                really eat and sleep here?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.

                                 SHELLY
                Liverpool?

                                 VADA
                Big Ringo fan.

                                 SHELLY
                Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?

                                 VADA
                I would.

                                 SHELLY
                Thomas?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes please.

        Thomas uproots himself and sits opposite Vada at the table

                                 THOMAS J
                What are you reading?

        Vada makes a gesture at Thomas J with her finger up to her 
        lips implying that he should be quiet

        Shelly notices Vada reading the book

                                 SHELLY
                Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a 
                little too old for you.

        She takes the book away from her

                                 VADA
                Did you read ALL these books?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh.

                                 VADA
                What are they about?

                                 SHELLY
                Mostly love, and romance.

                                 THOMAS J
                Eeeeuuuww, gross.

                                 SHELLY
                They're just fun to read.

        Shelly hands the soda around

                Here, cheers.

        Everybody takes a mouthful of drink

                                 VADA
                Are you married?

                                 SHELLY
                No, I'm divorced.

                                 VADA
                Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.

                                 SHELLY
                Well, sometimes married people just find out 
                they can't live with each other.

                                 THOMAS J
                Mine aren't divorced.

        Thomas J gets up and reaches for the cookie jar

                Shelly, can I have a cookie?

                                 SHELLY
        With bottle of soda in mouth
                Hmmmph gurgle gurgle...

        Thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey, where are all the cookies??

        Vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows 
        she has an idea

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I guess you found my secret hiding 
                place.

                                 THOMAS J
                What are you saving for?

                                 SHELLY
                Nothing in particular, just putting it away 
                for a rainy day.

        Cuckoo clock goes "Cuckoo." Lunch time, 12 o'clock

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch, 
                thanks Shelly.

        Thomas J leaves

                                 SHELLY
                Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head 
                back?

                                 VADA
                Can I use your bathroom first?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure.

                                 VADA
                You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if 
                you're late.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay.

        Shelly exits and Vada enters toilet with a VERY guilty look 
        on her face

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS, FOCUS ON MR. BIXLER

                                 MR. BIXLER
                The great way, is not difficult for those 
                with no preferences, with the absence of both 
                love and hate, everything becomes clear and 
                undisguised. That was written by a Chinese 
                Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I 
                choose to bring that up in a creative writing 
                class? Because, the absence of judgment helps 
                us to appreciate reality. In other words, I 
                want you to listen to your classmates writing, 
                with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's 
                gonna go first?

                                 GUY
                I got one.

        He gets up

                I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a 
                picture for you to see, I picked a rose for 
                you to smell, I planted grass for you to 
                touch, But you did not hear my song, You did 
                not see my picture, You did not smell my rose 
                and YOU did not touch my grass.

                Woman
                Maybe she was outta town?

                                 GUY#2
                That's not funny, his poem is about futility, 
                we toil in unrewarded obscurity.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Now, I hear judgment, let's not forget the 
                part about the open heart...

        The door at the back of the room opens and Vada enters 
        holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous

                Vada, is there, something I can do for you?

                                 VADA
                        (very nervous)
                I paid the money.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                For this class?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, this is an adult writing class.

                                 JUSTIN
                Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She want's 
                to be a writer.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, you sure you wanna do this?

        Vada nods her head

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Welcome to the class, go find a seat.

        The class applauds

                Okay ahh, who's next?

                                 RONDA
                I experienced something with my boyfriend the 
                other day, and I wrote a few words down.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                The floor's yours Ronda.

                                 RONDA
                He covers me like a blanket, from the cold, 
                dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know 
                it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's 
                real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I 
                can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in 
                Lighter joint.

        Several looks glance around the room. Vada raises her hand

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.

                                 VADA
                I wrote a poem too.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Please.

                                 VADA
                Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss
                I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good 
                when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, 
                This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate 
                or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.

                That's all I got so far.

                                 JUSTIN
                I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky 
                Road, it's about desire.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes 
                and that's also good  but, you're not 
                expressing to me what's in your soul. I want 
                you to show me how you see the world, your 
                fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my 
                mother.

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, THEN INSIDE ON SHELLY AT DESK, 
        TUBA IS BEING PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND

        Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and 
        proceeds to the living room

        Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a 
        tune to Grammoo on his tuba

                                 HARRY
                        (sung, to Grammoo)
                Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let 
                you know that the flowers were delivered. And 
                the room's all set up.

                                 HARRY
                Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the 
                other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a 
                little harsh.

                                 SHELLY
                I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's 
                business. It's just that I like Vada, very 
                much.

                                 HARRY
                After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to 
                help take care of Vada. They were very close, 
                but lately as her mind's been wandering more 
                and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm 
                sure she'll snap out of it though.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm sure she will.

        VADA AND THOMAS J AT THEIR FAVORITE SPOT, EDGE OF LAKE WITH 
        VERY LARGE BEAUTIFUL WEEPING WILLOW JUST UP THE BANK A 
        LITTLE FROM A SMALL PIER WHERE TWO FISHING POLES ARE SET UP, 
        ONE HELD BY VADA AND THE OTHER BY A HOLDER AS THOMAS J HANGS 
        UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE TREE

                                 THOMAS J
                Nothing's biting today.

                                 VADA
                Maybe they had a big breakfast.

                                 THOMAS J
                        (hanging from tree)
                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.

                                 VADA
                Big deal, I can do that too.
                        (Thomas J's reel begins to 
                        click)
                Thomas J, you got something!

                                 THOMAS J
                Oh no!
                        (he jumps down from the tree)
                UUH.

                                 VADA
                Hurry!

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm trying.

                                 VADA
                Reel it in.
                        (Thomas J reels the fish in)
                He's only tiny, throw him back.

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't like touching fish, how do you pull 
                the hook out without touching it?

        Thomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls

                                 VADA
                You're hurting him, don't kill him!!

        The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier

        Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor 
        error in film} and in the process pricks herself

                                 VADA
                Ouch! Darn hook!

        Vada puts the fish back

                                 VADA
                I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look.

        Thomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of 
        the water

                                 THOMAS J
                Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.

                                 VADA
                Hey, we can become blood brothers.

                                 THOMAS J
                Naah, I don't wanna.

                                 VADA
                You could pick that scab on your arm.

                                 THOMAS J
                It's a mosquito bite.

                                 VADA
                It'll bleed.

                                 THOMAS J
                If I do it, can we go?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, OW!

        Thomas J picks the scab on his arm which begins to bleed

                                 VADA
                Okay, rub them together.

        They rub their cuts together

                                 VADA
                Now we're blood brothers for life.

        HARRY IS TYPING UP A DEATH NOTICE IN HIS STUDY, SHELLY 
        ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                Oh Hi, what can I do for you?

                                 SHELLY
                Nothing, I was just wondering what you were 
                doing.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you 
                know when someone dies people want it in the 
                paper usually, it's a service we provide for 
                the family.

                                 SHELLY
                Oh right, right,
                        (she picks up the newspaper). 
                Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 
                1972 Devoted husband to 
                Nicolette. Cherished father of 
                Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu 
                of flowers, please send 
                donations to the holy names 
                society.

                                 HARRY
                I wrote that.

                                 SHELLY
                No kidding?

        Harry gives Shelly a matter-of-fact look

                                 SHELLY
                Oh it's good, "In lieu of" I love that word 
                lieu.

                                 HARRY
                I prefer it to "instead", it has more 
                dignity.

                                 SHELLY
                In lieu... "instead".... No contest.

                                 HARRY
                It's no big deal.

                                 SHELLY
                You have to learn how to take a complement.
                        (Shelly turns the newspaper 
                        over)
                Movies, movies, ahhhh, "Love Story" at the 
                drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?

                                 HARRY
                I haven't been to the movies in AGES.

                                 SHELLY
                I love going to movies, especially at the 
                drive in. I don't think there's anything more 
                romantic than going to the drive in.
                        (subtle HINT)
                I'll let you get back to work.

        Shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face

                                 HARRY
                I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to 
                join me for a game tomorrow night at church 
                you're welcome to.

                                 SHELLY
                        (considers for a moment)
                Okay.

        Harry resumes typing

        VADA IS RUNNING THROUGH FOYER AND BEGINS TO PASS BATHROOM 
        WHERE SHELLY IS PUTTING ON MAKEUP

                                 SHELLY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Are you going out somewhere?

                                 SHELLY
                No.

                                 VADA
                So how come you're putting lipstick on?

                                 SHELLY
                A girl's always gotta look her best.

                                 VADA
                I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are 
                that color.

                                 SHELLY
                Have you ever tried any?

                                 VADA
                No.

                                 SHELLY
                Come here, sit down.

        Vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet 
        seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of 
        Vada. Vada gets some lipstick put on her

                                 SHELLY
                Now, first we blot.

        Vada blots her lips on some tissue

                                 SHELLY
                Take a look. I think it looks real nice on 
                you.

        Vada looks in Shelly's mirror

                                 VADA
                Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've 
                got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest 
                little nose, an amazing mouth.

                                 VADA
                The boys at school don't think I am.

                                 SHELLY
                They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna 
                bring out the gorgeous color in them. The 
                first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can 
                never wear enough blue eye shadow.

                                 VADA
                Do you like putting makeup on people?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to 
                Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the 
                stars, I haven't gotten there yet.
                        (she finishes her work)
                All right, open your eyes.

        Vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror

                                 VADA
                Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that 
                Hollywood thing.

        VADA EXITS HOUSE THROUGH FRONT DOOR, RAUNCHY MUSIC IS 
        PLAYING AND SHE DOES A GROOVY WALK TO THE STEPS WHERE THOMAS 
        J AWAITS HER, SHE LIES DOWN LENGTH WAYS ACROSS THE STEP AND 
        LOOKS AT HIM

                                 THOMAS J
                Your lip bleeding?

                                 VADA
                No.

                                 THOMAS J
                What's wrong with your eyes?

                                 VADA
                A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

                                 THOMAS J
                Where's your bike?

                                 VADA
                Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

        The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is 
        parked

                                 VADA
                It's only a garage, come on.

        Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone

                                 VADA
                Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably 
                fell off in here.

        Thomas J walks over to a model of a head

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey look at this!

                                 VADA
                That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, 
                they used to study the bumps in your head to 
                see if you had a good personality or not. Come 
                here, i'll diagnose your head.

                                 THOMAS J
                No, I don't wanna.

                                 VADA
                Come on, it's fun.

        Vada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the 
        chart

                                 VADA
                Hmmmm, interesting.

                                 THOMAS J
                What?

                                 VADA
                You have no personality.

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey, where does it say that?

                                 VADA
                Never mind.

        Thomas J knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo

                                 THOMAS J
                Is that your Dad?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 THOMAS J
                Who's that with your Dad?

                                 VADA
                It's my mother.

                                 THOMAS J
                Do you remember her?

                                 VADA
                No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

                                 THOMAS J
                What do you think it's like?

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
                Heaven.

                                 VADA
                I think, everybody gets their own white 
                horse, and all they do is ride and eat 
                marshmallows all day, and everybody's best 
                friends with everybody else, when you play 
                sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets 
                picked last.

                                 THOMAS J
                But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

                                 VADA
                It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular 
                horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal 
                if you fall, you just land in cloud.

                                 THOMAS J
                That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll 
                never find that streamer.

        As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then 
        returns to Thomas J

        HARRY'S BEDROOM, HARRY IS DRESSING AND GETTING READY FOR 
        HIS DATE WITH SHELLY

        The tune "Moonglow" is playing on the radio

                                 PHIL
                Well well well, what's going on in here?

                                 HARRY
                Nothing, I'm dressing.

                                 PHIL
                Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry 
                Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to 
                lie to your big brother?

        Phil then proceeds to give Harry a noogie

                                 HARRY
                HEY! WATCH THE HAIR!! THIS SHIRT GIVES!!! ALL 
                RIGHT!!!!

        Phil stops

                I'm going out with Shelly.

                                 PHIL
                Oh yes, oh that's great.

                                 HARRY
                I'm very nervous.

                                 PHIL
                Why?

                                 HARRY
                The last date I had was twenty years ago.

                                 PHIL
                That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me 
                fill you in on today's women, since the last 
                time you dated, something happened, "The 
                Sexual Revolution", now before that, you used 
                to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull 
                her chair out, pick up the check, no more no 
                more, you wanna know what else is missing? 
                BRAS!

                                 HARRY
                Oh come on.

                                 PHIL
                Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this 
                woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her 
                like every Tom Dick and Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Are you sure about all this?

                                 PHIL
                Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?

                                 HARRY
                Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any 
                minute.

                                 PHIL
                Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the 
                right track.

                                 HARRY
                No, she's just driving over here, then we're 
                taking my car. How do I look?

                                 PHIL
                Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.

        Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way

                                 HARRY
                Goodnight Vada.

                                 VADA
                Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, I just wanna look nice.

                                 VADA
                You never cared before.

                                 HARRY
                Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go 
                together.

                                 VADA
                Why?

                                 HARRY
                She likes to play bingo.

                                 VADA
                Can I go too?

                                 HARRY
                Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep 
                Grammoo company.

        Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out 
        the door

        OUTSIDE THE SENNET'S HOUSE, VADA IS CREEPING ALONG NIGHT

        Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the 
        window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does

                                 THOMAS J
                Vada? Vada?? Where are you??

        Vada springs up from her hiding place

                                 VADA
                Here.

                                 THOMAS J
                Don't DO that!!

                                 VADA
                Sorry.

                                 THOMAS J
                What do you want? My mom will skin me alive 
                if she finds I'm out here.

                                 VADA
                Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo 
                tonight.

                                 THOMAS J
                I told you i'll get in trouble.

                                 VADA
                Pacifist!

                                 THOMAS J
                I am not.

                                 VADA
                Bed wetter!

                                 THOMAS J
                I stopped that!

        AT THE CHURCH, FOCUS ON THE BINGO ANNOUNCER WHO IS CALLING 
        OUT THE NUMBERS

                                 HARRY
                Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For 
                instance, on a given night anybody can win, 
                but I play the odds, when choosing bingo 
                cards, I use a range of theories from the laws 
                of probability to avoiding duplicate number 
                systems. This way you get much more activity.

                                 SHELLY
                        (hopeful)
                Does it make it easier to win?

                                 HARRY
                No. Just, more activity.

        Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting 
        Shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down

                                 HARRY
                        (as he sits down, to the 
                        person next to him)
                Hi Carl.

        OUTSIDE THE CHURCH NIGHT

        Vada and Thomas J are walking up to the church

                                 THOMAS J
                They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.

                                 VADA
                We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.

                                 THOMAS J
                Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.

                                 VADA
                Duck!

        Vada and Thomas J are ducking behind a counter on one side 
        of the church, Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on 
        the other side of the room

                                 SHELLY
                        (in the distance, as a number 
                        is announced)
                Oh great!

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

                                 VADA
                Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.

                                 SHELLY
                        (in the distance again, as 
                        another number is announced)
                Aarrggh.

        CLOSE UP OF HARRY AND SHELLY

        As Shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that 
        everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big 
        way

                                 SHELLY
                I just had a terrible thought Harry.

                                 HARRY
                What's that?

                                 SHELLY
                I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these 
                people very soon.

                                 HARRY
                Why d'you think these seats were empty.

        OUTSIDE

                                 THOMAS J
                Can we go yet?

                                 VADA
                Go???

                                 THOMAS J
                You know I'm not allowed outside my myself 
                after dark.

        CLOSE UP AGAIN

                                 SHELLY
                Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending 
                upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 
                10 cards could win just as easily as a guy 
                with 100.

                                 SHELLY
                Kinda like men.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, how do you mean?

                                 SHELLY
                You can be in a room with 100 men, and not 
                like any of them, or you can be in a room with 
                just one man, and he's exactly the one you 
                want.

        Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other, Vada sees 
        this and doesn't look too happy about it

                                 VADA
                        (in semi-deep fake voice)
                BINGO!

                                 BINGO ANNOUNCER
                We have a winner. Will the winner please 
                raise their hand?

                                 CARL
                There was no bingo, it came from outside.

                                 VERNON
                How could someone outside get a bingo?

                                 CARL
                Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone 
                outside yelled bingo you moron!

                                 VERNON
                Who are you calling a mowon?
                        (false teeth)

                                 VERNON'S WIFE
                Put a lid on it Vernon!

                                 CARL
                Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years 
                old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!

        The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break 
        it up

                                 HARRY
                Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.

        Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing

        OUTSIDE

                                 VADA
                We can go now.

        Vada and Thomas J run off down the street

        VADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING

        As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her 
        window and looks out it through the venetian blinds

        OUTSIDE STOPPED CAR

        Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side 
        and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers 
        advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, 
        eventually

                                 SHELLY
                I had a good time tonight.

                                 HARRY
                I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

        They walk up to Shelly's camper

                                 SHELLY
                Would you like to come in and see my house? 
                Just for a minute.

                                 HARRY
                Okay, sure.

        They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room

        INSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER

                                 SHELLY
                Home sweet home.

                                 HARRY
                It's nice.

                                 SHELLY
                I did it myself. I read a magazine article 
                about how to maximize small spaces.

                                 HARRY
                Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.

                                 SHELLY
                You can look in the bathroom if you want. 
                People are always curious about that, like 
                what happens when you flush.

        Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the 
        bathroom, and then flushes the toilet

                                 HARRY
                Yeah.

                                 SHELLY
                Are you mad at me?

                                 HARRY
                No, why?

                                 SHELLY
                I don't know, tonight you just seemed a 
                little cool, not opening car doors and...

                                 HARRY
                Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice 
                on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of 
                touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not 
                since my wife died.

                                 SHELLY
                What happened to her?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, complications during child birth, she 
                died two days after Vada was born.

                                 SHELLY
                Did she ever see Vada?

                                 HARRY
                I brought the baby into the room a couple of 
                times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think 
                she saw Vada. It was.....

        Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling 
        with to calm his nerves

                Did I ruin this?

                                 SHELLY
                Dance with me?

                                 HARRY
                Here?

                                 SHELLY
                This is where we are.

                                 HARRY
                Is there enough room?

        Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more 
        room

                                 HARRY
                I haven't danced in.....

                                 SHELLY
                In ages, I know, me neither.

        They begin a slow dance

                                 HARRY
                Rock?

                                 SHELLY
                See, you're not that out of touch.
                        (they dance)
                You're good.

                                 HARRY
                At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot 
                date, I did a killer frugue.

        Shelly smells Harry's neck

                                 SHELLY
                What are you wearing?

                                 HARRY
                Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

        They continue to dance

                                 SHELLY
                Do you want to?

                                 HARRY
                Want to what?

                                 SHELLY
                Kiss me.

                                 HARRY
                Yes.

                                 SHELLY
                Good.

        They then have a long kiss

                                 SHELLY
                Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very 
                optimistic.

        They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock 
        cuckooing

                                 HARRY
                I ahh, better go.

                                 SHELLY
                It's only eight o'clock.

                                 HARRY
                Goodnight Shelly.

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

        Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the 
        door

        OUTSIDE CAMPER NIGHT, HARRY HAS JUST GOT OUT OF SHELLY'S 
        CAMPER

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I guess it's official we had a date, 
                maybe we can play bingo again sometime.

                                 HARRY
                I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that 
                drive in of yours.

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

        Harry waves

        VADA'S ROOM

        Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS DAY

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Before the class started, Ronda and Justin 
                wanted to lead the class in a group 
                meditation.

                WOMAN
                Ooooh that's really cool.

                                 JUSTIN
                Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes 
                out into the group.

        Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play 
        weird music

                                 RONDA
                Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. 
                Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.

                                 JUSTIN
                Now, try to feel what the other person is 
                feeling, without speaking any words, send out 
                your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at 
                the same time. Can you feel it?

                                 RONDA
                Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody 
                feel?

                                 GUY
                I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

                OTHER GUY
                I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, 
                she's so cosmically in tune.

                                 RONDA
                So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, 
                and I felt like, you were full of inner peace 
                and harmony.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, what did you feel.

                                 VADA
                I felt Justin's hangnail.

                                 JUSTIN
                No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a 
                hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, 
                feel my aura.

                                 VADA
                I don't think I'm allowed to.

                                 JUSTIN
                I tell you what, let's try it again, hold 
                hands.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. 
                It got infected and traveled to her vocal 
                chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't 
                think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.

        VADA'S ROOM, VADA LYING ON BED THINKING

        Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, 
        she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed 
        and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual 
        healing

        SUPERMARKET DAY, VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING

                                 HARRY
                Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get 
                lettuce.

        Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out

                                 SHELLY
                Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                I'm just picking some things up for the 
                barbecue.

                                 SHELLY
                Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

                                 HARRY
                Not at all. Lot of potatoes!

                                 SHELLY
                It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

                                 HARRY
                I'm looking forward to that.

        Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and 
        Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly, 
        and she rams her cart into Harry

                                 HARRY
                HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're 
                doing.

                                 VADA
                Sorry.

                                 SHELLY
                You know this is gonna be my first 4th of 
                July picnic in a long time.

                                 HARRY
                Really?

                                 VADA
                        (picking up large can of 
                        prunes)
                Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL 
                bad?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the 
                cart, anything at all.
                        (to Shelly)
                I don't know what's gotten into her today.

        Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the 
        shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not 
        giving a stuff what they contain

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie 
                dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas 
                I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do 
                was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't 
                too upset when they took that wrong turn and 
                went over a cliff.

        CLOSE UP OF AMERICAN FLAG DAY, HARRY - PLAYING TUBA, 
        SHELLY, PHIL & VADA SINGING "STAR SPANGLED BANNER" AND 
        GRAMMOO STANDING NEXT TO THEM WATCHING

        MUSTANG PULLS UP NEXT TO SHELLY'S CAMPER, IT STOPS AND TWO 
        MEN GET OUT

        HARRY COOKING MEAT PATTIES ON BARBECUE, WHICH ARE BEGINNING 
        TO LOOK CHARRED, PHIL IS STANDING NEXT TO HIM

                                 PHIL
                Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to 
                use fewer briquettes and now look what you've 
                done. You've cremated them.

                                 HARRY
                That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??

                                 PHIL
                No, no no....

                                 HARRY
                Look if you think you know how, why don't you 
                pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, 
                put out a product, support me for a while!

        Phil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry

                                 SHELLY
                How's it going chef?

                                 HARRY
                Okay.

        Vada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly, 
        she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close 
        together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between 
        Harry and Shelly

                                 VADA
                Are they ready yet?

                                 HARRY
                No, sweetie, not yet.

        Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which 
        Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off

                                 VADA
                When?

                                 HARRY
                Soon honey, soon.

        Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair
                        (which there doesn't appear 
                        to be anything wrong with)
        And Vada shakes her off again

                                 VADA
                When??

                                 HARRY
                In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll 
                burn your nose, look out.

        Vada backs off, followed by Shelly

        THE TWO MEN THAT GOT OUT OF THE CAR ARE PROCEEDING UP THE 
        SULTENFUSS' DRIVEWAY

        FOCUS ON PHIL, HARRY, VADA, SHELLY AND GRAMMOO AT THE TABLE 
        OUTSIDE, SHELLY SAYS A SEMI-GRACE

                                 SHELLY
                Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.

                                 HARRY
                I'll second that.

                                 VADA
                Hey Shelly, like seafood?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh, why?

                                 VADA
                See food!

        Vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed BBQ cuisine 
        to Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                        (laughing)
                That's attractive.

        Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side 
        of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing 
        looking around

                                 SHELLY
                        (under her breath)
                Oh shit! Excuse me...

        Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and 
        Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can 
        already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space

                                 MAN
                Hey Shelly, who lives here?
                        (pointing at hearse)
                The Addams Family?

                                 SHELLY
                Danny, what are you doing here?

                                 DANNY
                What am I doing here????? What am I doing 
                here?

                                 SHELLY
                        (to other man in background) 
                Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?

                                 DANNY
                You told everybody where you were going, I'm 
                here for the motor home.

        Scene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment

                                 PHIL
                These two people do not have a good 
                relationship.

                                 SHELLY
                        (in background)
                No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it...

        Scene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing

                                 SHELLY
                I've been living in it for over a year, the 
                camper is mine.

                                 DANNY
                Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the 
                lawyer said, it's supposed to be "OUR MUTUAL 
                ASSET", not "Shelly's recreational vehicle". 
                Gimme the keys.

                                 SHELLY
                Keep your voice down!

                                 DANNY
                What?

                                 SHELLY
                The boss is watching us...

                                 DANNY
                        (sarcastic)
                I'm impressed.

                                 SHELLY
                God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.

                                 DANNY
                Yeah, all right...

        Shelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of 
        the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind

                                 SHELLY
                        (Talking to Danny, pointing 
                        at the people respectively)
                This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada 
                Sultenfuss...

                                 DANNY
                Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.

                                 VADA
                        (matter-of-fact)
                I like my name.

                                 SHELLY
                        (to the Sultenfuss')
                This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino 
                Raphael salon in Detroit.
                        (pointing at Danny)
                We used to be married.

                                 VADA
                        (extremely hopeful, to Danny)
                Are you here to take Shelly back?

        Danny shakes his head at Vada, then Harry gets up and walks 
        round the table

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got 
                burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to 
                join us?

                                 DANNY
                Can't stay, I'm just here because my 
                wife.....

        Shelly quickly interjects

                                 SHELLY
                Ex...ex, ex...

                                 DANNY
                My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my 
                camper.

                                 HARRY
                Shelly?

                                 SHELLY
                Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I 
                promise.....

                                 DANNY
                I don't think so, I got a copy of the 
                property settlement right here.

        Danny pulls out a piece of paper

                Ahh Shit, this is my lease...... Damn it, I 
                keep forgetting things, I'm getting senile.

                                 HARRY
                Danny?

                                 DANNY
                WHAT?

                                 HARRY
                Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, 
                and there's really nothing anyone can do to 
                comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the 
                times you had with the camper, the trips you 
                took, the sights you saw, those days are gone 
                now, but they'll live on in your heart 
                forever.

                                 DANNY
                        (to Shelly)
                This guy bonking you?

                                 SHELLY
                        (disgusted)
                Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!

                                 HARRY
                        (to Danny)
                Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.

                                 DANNY
                Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?

                                 HARRY
                It's her home! It's where she lives!!

                                 DANNY
                Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,
                        (to Shelly)
                Gimme the goddam keys.

        Danny tries to grab the keys from Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Stop it! That hurts!!

        Harry is now VERY annoyed

                                 HARRY
                Danny.....

        As Harry says "Danny" for a second time he plants his fist 
        in Danny's stomach with force, winding him and shutting him 
        up

        FOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL'S FACES, WHICH ARE STARTLED

        FULL SCENE, SHELLY IS GAPING, DANNY IS BENT OVER WITH RALPH 
        HOLDING HIM UP, VADA AND PHIL WATCHING CLOSELY AND GRAMMOO 
        STARING INTO SPACE

                                 RALPH
                What'd you do that for??

                                 HARRY
                Who are you?

                                 RALPH
                I'm his brother.

                                 HARRY
                Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here 
                quite often.

                                 RALPH
                WHY??

                                 HARRY
                Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's 
                camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front 
                yard.

        Ralph looks rather disturbed by this

        FOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL, VADA STILL GAPING

                                 PHIL
                        (quiet voice, to Vada)
                Your father is a savage.

        Vada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods

        ROAD IN FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, DANNY AND RALPH IN CAR, 
        SHELLY LEANING OVER WITH HER HEAD IN WINDOW NIGHT

                                 SHELLY
                Bye Ralph.

        The car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly 
        waves

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Harry)
                Well, you were pretty great!

                                 HARRY
                Is it really your camper?

        Shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting "sort 
        of"

        Suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then 
        explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks

                                 SHELLY
                Can we see it from the back yard?

                                 HARRY
                You can get the general idea...

        They move off to the back yard...

                                 HARRY
                Yep, there they are... They always look the 
                same every year...

                                 SHELLY
        Pointing upwards Look...

                                 HARRY
                Did you ahh, love him?

                                 SHELLY
                I would never marry anybody I didn't love.

        VADA AND PHIL SITTING ON SEAT-SWING WATCHING FIREWORKS

                                 VADA
                He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit 
                anyone in his life.

                                 PHIL
                He likes her.

                                 VADA
                Does he love her?

                                 PHIL
                Probably.

                                 VADA
                Do you like her?

                                 PHIL
                Yes I do, and I think she's very good for 
                your father.

                                 VADA
                Why?

                                 PHIL
                After your mother died, he was sad all the 
                time, but before that, he was pretty funny.

                                 VADA
                Really?

                                 PHIL
                Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he 
                seems like the old Harry.

                                 VADA
                My Dad was funny?

                                 PHIL
                Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but 
                he made me laugh.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a 
                steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he 
                didn't come back the same, one night, he 
                picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his 
                teeth, it was really neat.

        DR WELTY'S SURGERY, LOOKING AT VADA WHO HAS HER MOUTH OPEN 
        WITH A TONGUE HOLDING STICK DOWN HER THROAT

                                 VADA
                Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.

                                 VADA
                        (with stick in mouth)
                Carnnk yu sheeee ik??

        Dr. Welty removes stick from Vada's mouth

                                 VADA
                Can't you see it?

                                 DR WELTY
                No.

                                 VADA
                It's there.

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your 
                throat.

        Vada looks at the Dr.'s certificates up on the wall

                                 VADA
                Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?

        WAITING ROOM, NURSE RANDALL IS DEMONSTRATING A SYRINGE TO 
        THOMAS J, HOW TO USE IT AS A WATER GUN

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                So you fill it with water like this, and what 
                have you got? A water gun.

                                 THOMAS J
                Cool, can I get one for Vada?

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Oh yes, yes.

        She gets another one out of her drawer

                Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada 
                ever tell you why she comes down here so much?

                                 THOMAS J
                Cause she's dying.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Do you think she is?

                                 THOMAS J
                No.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Why do you think she says that?

                                 THOMAS J
                Cause she gets scared of all those dead 
                people in her house, and you know that saying, 
                If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if 
                she's one of them, she won't be as scared.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                You know what I think? I think Vada's very 
                lucky to have a friend like you.

        Nurse Randall hands Thomas J another syringe

                                 THOMAS J
                She's my best friend.

        The door to the doctor's surgery opens and Vada exits

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

                                 VADA
                As good as can be expected.

        CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOCTORS WAITING ROOM

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey Vada, guess what we got?

                                 VADA
                What?

        Thomas J begins to run, and as he passes Vada he squirts 
        his syringe at Vada

                                 THOMAS J
                THIS!!
                        (squirt)

                                 VADA
                HEY YOU!!!!
                        (squirt)
                I'm gonna get you!!!
                        (squirt)
                I'll get you!!!!

        Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down 
        the stairs

        FOREST DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE RUNNING THROUGH IT FIRING 
        THEIR WATER GUNS AT EACH OTHER AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER, 
        HAVING FUN

        Suddenly Thomas J stops in his tracks

                                 THOMAS J
                Woah!!

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
        Pointing There's a beehive right there!

                                 VADA
                So?

                                 THOMAS J
                Stand back.

        Thomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and 
        begins to squirt the beehive

                                 VADA
                Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!

                                 THOMAS J
                You're right, let's knock it down.

                                 VADA
                What do you want it for anyway?

                                 THOMAS J
                For their meat.

        The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets 
        damaged and eventually falls to the ground

                                 THOMAS J
                Got it!

                                 VADA
                My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

        They begin to search for Vada's mood ring

        Suddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas J notices in 
        time

                                 THOMAS J
                They're alive!! Run for your life!!!

        Vada just stands there looking, Thomas J comes back and 
        grabs her arm, this wakes her up and they begin to run

                                 THOMAS J
                Run faster they're after us!!

                                 VADA
                I am running faster!!

                                 THOMAS J
                Hurry!!!

        They have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the 
        pier, they run out on to the pier

                                 VADA
                Jump in the water!!

                                 THOMAS J
                But I have my clothes on!

                                 VADA
                Do it!

        UNDER WATER VIEW OF THEM BOTH, HOLDING THEIR BREATH

        INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR TO SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA ENTERS 
        DRENCHED

                                 HARRY
                        (in the distance, from 
                        upstairs)
                Vada is that you?

                                 VADA
                Yes..

                                 HARRY
                Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival 
                tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.

        Vada likes this news, she hurries up the stairs

                                 HARRY
                Shelly's coming with us.

        Vada is now not so happy

        CARNIVAL  NIGHT, FERRIS WHEEL IS SPINNING, MANY PEOPLE ARE 
        SCREAMING IN A TYPICAL CARNIVAL MANNER, SLOW ZOOM ON HARRY, 
        SHELLY AND VADA

                                 SHELLY
                So Vada, what's your favorite ride?

                                 VADA
                I like the freak show.

                                 HARRY
                I know, I know, let's go on the "sit on the 
                bench and rest" ride.

                                 SHELLY
                I don't think that that roller coaster agreed 
                with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have 
                to watch what you eat here, I remember one 
                time I went to a carnival with my cousins 
                David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, 
                and the next day they came down with 
                nephritis.

                                 VADA
                Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't 
                get it from hot dogs.

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next 
                day they had really high fevers, and their 
                faces got very fat. They baffled medical 
                science, they were in a magazine.

        Vada and Harry give Shelly a "yeah RIGHT" look

                                 SHELLY
                They were!! "Popular Mechanics", no "Popular 
                Science". I don't know, popular.

        HARRY, SHELLY AND VADA ARE STANDING AT A STALL WHERE OBJECT 
        IS TO GET A BALL IN FISH BOWL

                                 SHELLY
                Oh look they're trying to hit that poor 
                thing.

                                 HARRY
                Watch you don't knock out a fish.

                                 SHELLY
                Perfect.

                                 HARRY
                I don't know which ball's mine.

        Vada gets a ball in a bowl

                                 VADA
                I won, I won!!!

                                 SHELLY
                Oh great!!

                ATTENDANT
                Hooray, we have a winner,
                        (picks up fish in plastic 
                        bag)
                There you go little girl.
                        (gives fish to Vada)
                See how easy it is folks!

        Shelly inspects fish, holding it along with Vada

                                 SHELLY
                Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.

        Vada notices something on Shelly's hand

                                 VADA
                Where'd you get that ring?

        All of a sudden Shelly looks up with a guilty look

                                 VADA
                        (extremely hopeful)
                Did you win it?

        Harry and Shelly exchange looks, Harry smiles, followed by 
        Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Vada we have something to tell you. Harry?

        Harry sits down on table and looks at Vada in a matter-of-
        fact way

                                 HARRY
                Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are 
                getting married.

        Vada's expression begins to change from hopeful, to horror, 
        but then she drops her fish

                                 VADA
                Oh my fish!!!

        Vada quickly bends over to pick up the fish

                                 HARRY
                We're having the wedding sometime near the 
                end of the summer.

                                 VADA
        Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little 
        fish.

                                 SHELLY
                Vada? Would you like us to get you another 
                goldfish?

                                 VADA
                        (angry)
                NO!, He's fine.
                        (less angry, talking to fish)
                Fish are very resilient animals you know. 
                Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

        Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem 
        to have understood

                                 ANNOUNCER

                                 SHELLY
                Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival 
                and not ride the bumper cars.

                                 HARRY
                I fall asleep at the wheel.

                                 VADA
                        (malicious grin)
                I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!

                                 SHELLY
                Oh great Vada, come on...

        They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the 
        fish

                                 SHELLY
                        (to the attendant)
                Uhh, two.
                        (to Vada)
                I got the blue one!!

        Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car

                                 VADA
                NO!

                                 SHELLY
                Yes!!

        Shelly gets in the blue one

                                 SHELLY
                        (pointing at Vada)
                I am gonna get you.

        Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada 
        the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering 
        something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does 
        so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the 
        song is "Bad Moon Rising"

                                 HARRY
                Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!

        Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top 
        speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly 
        screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada 
        rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and 
        eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't 
        escape Vada

                                 HARRY
                Careful Vada, careful.

                                 HARRY
                Shelly LOOK OUT!

        WWHHAAMMM

        Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives 
        Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin

        VADA IS RIDING HER BIKE ALONG HER STREET TOWARDS THE 
        CAMERA, SHE STOPS AND DISMOUNTS OUTSIDE THOMAS J'S HOUSE

        Vada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi, can Thomas J come out?

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Sure, come in.

        Thomas J is coming down the stairs

                                 THOMAS J
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi, wanna ride bikes?

                                 THOMAS J
                Sure.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Ohh, did you make your bed?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                You're sure?

                                 THOMAS J
                It's made.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Come here, you've got a milk mustache.

        Mrs. Sennett wipes Thomas J's lip

                                 THOMAS J
                Come on, let's go.

                                 VADA
                Bye Mrs. Sennett.

                                 THOMAS J
                Bye Ma.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Have fun kids.

        The two exit the house

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF SENNETT'S HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE 
        WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS

                                 VADA
                I'm running away.

                                 THOMAS J
                Where you running to?

        They get on their bikes and begin to ride off

                                 VADA
                California, I'm going to Hollywood to live 
                with the Brady Bunch.

                                 THOMAS J
                I wanna live with them too.

                                 VADA
                No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll 
                have to live with the Partridge Family.

                                 THOMAS J
                Really?

        SOMEWHERE ON A PATHWAY IN A LIGHT FOREST, VADA AND THOMAS J 
        ARE RIDING THEIR BIKES

        Thomas J stops and then does Vada

                                 THOMAS J
                That's it.

        Thomas J goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows 
        with an annoyed look

                                 VADA
                Get up!?

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past 
                this place two times already. We're not 
                getting nowhere.

        Vada sits down next to Thomas J

                                 THOMAS J
                Why are you running away?

                                 VADA
                My Dad gave Shelly a ring.

                                 THOMAS J
                Wow, was it a decoder ring?

                                 VADA
                You're such a retard, it was an engagement 
                ring.

                                 THOMAS J
                They're getting married?

        Vada nods her head

                                 THOMAS J
                So now you'll have a mother.

                                 VADA
                I don't like her.

                                 THOMAS J
                I do, she's real funny.

                                 VADA
                He likes her better than me.

        A TREE DUSK, THOMAS J AND VADA ARE UP THE TOP OF IT

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.

                                 VADA
                Then go home, baby.

                                 THOMAS J
                I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.

                                 VADA
                Leave then, some friend you are.

                                 THOMAS J
                You can come to my house for dinner?

                                 VADA
                No, I'm hiding out.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, seeya.

        Thomas J climbs down from tree, and leaves

        DISSOLVE INTO NEXT SCENE

        VADA STILL IN TREE NIGHT, SHE LOOKS AROUND AND THEN DECIDES 
        TO GET DOWN

        Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on 
        the Sultenfuss' front lawn

        INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR, VADA ENTERS AND CLOSES IT

        As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come 
        running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, 
        they were so worried etc., Nothing happens, all she can hear 
        is the noise that the TV is making. So she opens the door 
        again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up, 
        and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV 
        is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs

        Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                In social studies we learned some people 
                stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, 
                I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN 
                tonight.

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, A LOUD HIGH PITCHED SCREAM IS 
        HEARD

        VIEW OF CORRIDOR LEADING TO BATHROOM

                                 VADA
                OH MY GOD!!!

        Vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs

                                 VADA
                DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?!

        Vada runs into a room where Shelly is

                                 VADA
                Daddy??!?!?!

                                 SHELLY
                Vada, Vada, what's the matter?

                                 VADA
                Where's Daddy?

                                 SHELLY
                Well he just left, what's wrong?

                                 VADA
                I'm hemorrhaging.

                                 SHELLY
                What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?

                                 VADA
                        (very weak, scared voice)
                I don't want, I don't need your help....

        Vada tries to run away, but Shelly stops her

                                 SHELLY
                Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

        Vada nods her head

                                 SHELLY
                How old are you?

                                 VADA
                I'm eleven and a half.

                                 SHELLY
                It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have 
                a little talk.

        They exit

        VADA'S BEDROOM, VADA AND SHELLY SITTING ON BED

                                 VADA
                My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?

                                 SHELLY
                It's actually a very beautiful thing, and 
                look there wouldn't have been a Vada.

                                 VADA
                I think it should be outlawed.

                                 SHELLY
                Believe me, some day, you'll feel 
                differently.

        Door bell is heard ringing

                                 VADA
                Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna 
                see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to 
                boys.

        OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA OPENS DOOR

                                 THOMAS J
                Hi Vada, can you come out?

                                 VADA
                I dunno..

                                 THOMAS J
                Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go 
                swimming?

        Vada is angered by this, she comes storming out

                                 VADA
                NO!

        Vada pushed Thomas J hard enough to make him fall over, she 
        is angry

                Get outta here!! And don't come back for five 
                to seven days!!!

        Vada runs inside and slams the door, leaving poor Thomas J 
        sitting on the porch looking startled

        FUNERAL ROOM OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, PIPE ORGAN IS BEING 
        PLAYED, MANY PEOPLE ARE SEATED AND THERE IS AN OPEN COFFIN 
        UP THE FRONT

        LIVING ROOM, VADA IS READING A BOOK, AND WATCHING GRAMMOO 
        TO BE SURE THAT SHE DOESN'T WANDER OFF, VADA PUTS THE BOOK 
        DOWN

                                 VADA
                Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be 
                right back.

        She then gives Grammoo a little kiss, and makes her way out 
        of the living room to the bathroom, closing the door behind 
        her, as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling 
        coming from the next room, so she goes to investigate. Harry 
        and Shelly are kissing and giggling. As she is watching 
        this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her 
        way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose, 
        takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the 
        rose as if it were a microphone

                                 GRAMMOO
                It's quarter to three, there's no-one in the 
                place, just you and me.

        As this is being sung, Vada hears and turns around with an 
        OH SHIT look on her face, Harry and Shelly also hear it 
        and make off for the funeral room, Vada quickly retreats 
        into the room where Harry and Shelly were, closing the door 
        behind her

                So santa-macho, I got a little story you 
                oughtta know, we're comin' my friend, to the 
                end of a brief episode, so make it one for my 
                baby and one more for the road.

                                 HARRY
                I'm so sorry, it's all right ma, I'm very 
                very sorry.

        ROOM IN SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY BURSTS IN, CLEARLY HE IS 
        VERY ANGRY

                                 HARRY
        Grabs Vada by the shoulders 
                Now what were you thinking, huh? HUH???? It's 
                your responsibility to watch her!! Do you have 
                any idea how upset those people are in 
                there???!

        Vada breaks free from Harry's grip, and walks briskly out 
        of the room. Shelly looks back at Harry expectantly

        WEEPING WILLOW TREE DOWN AT THE LAKES EDGE, VADA AND THOMAS 
        J ARE SITTING UNDER IT RESTING QUIETLY

                                 VADA
                Why do you think people want to get married?

                                 THOMAS J
                Well when you get older, you just have to.

                                 VADA
                I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.

                                 THOMAS J
                You can't marry a teacher, it's against the 
                law.

                                 VADA
                It is not.

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's 
                and it won't be fair.

                                 VADA
                Not true.

                                 VADA
                        (nervously, uncertain)
                Have you ever kissed anyone?

                                 THOMAS J
                Like they do on TV?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                No.

                                 VADA
                Maybe we should, just to see what's the big 
                deal.

                                 THOMAS J
                But, I don't know how.

                                 VADA
                Here, practice on your arm like this.

        Vada brings her forearm up to her mouth and starts to kiss 
        it, Thomas J follows

                                 THOMAS J
                Like this?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.
                        (they kiss their arms for a 
                        while)
                Okay, enough practice.

                                 VADA
                Close your eyes.

                                 THOMAS J
                But then I won't be able to see anything.

        Vada raises her fist

                                 VADA
                Just do it.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, okay.

                                 VADA
                Okay on the count of three.

        CAMERA SWITCHES ANGLES TO GIVE A CLEAR SIDE ON OF THOMAS J

                                 VADA
                One.

                                 VADA
                Two.

                                 VADA
                Two and a half.

                                 VADA
                Three.

        Vada leans forward and kisses Thomas J on the lips, they 
        both look surprised, Vada then sits back against the tree, 
        long pause

                                 VADA
                Say something it's too quiet.

                                 THOMAS J
                Umm, Ummmmm

                                 VADA
                        (agitated)
                Just, hurry.

        Thomas J stands up and begins to say something along the 
        lines of...

                                 THOMAS J
                On political agents to the flag of the United 
                States of America,

        Vada stands up and joins in

                                 THOMAS J & VADA
                And to the republic for which it stands, one 
                nation, under God, individual, with liberty 
                and justice for all.

        When they finish, they both still look a little 
        uncomfortable

        ROAD DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE WHEELING THEIR BIKES BACK 
        DOWN IT

                                 VADA
                You better not tell anyone.

                                 THOMAS J
                You better not either.

                                 VADA
                Well, let's spit on it.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay.

        Both of them raise their hands to their mouths and spit on 
        them, they then shake hands and when finished wipe them off 
        on their trousers

                                 VADA
                Seeya tomorrow.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, seeya.
                        (Vada starts off down the 
                        road)
                Vada?

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
                Would you think of me?

                                 VADA
                For what?

                                 THOMAS J
                Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

        Vada smiles, and gets on her bike

                                 VADA
                I guess.

        As Vada rides off, Thomas J smiles

        BACK IN THE WOODS WHERE VADA AND THOMAS J HAD FOUND THE 
        BEEHIVE

        Thomas J comes across the beehive, inspects it and then 
        kicks it, he waits and then once he is adamant that there is 
        no danger, he begins to search for Vada's mood ring, he 
        searches, and as he does so, bees begin to swarm, he finds 
        the mood ring, and by the time he notices that there are 
        bees everywhere, it is too late..

                                 THOMAS J
                        (as he finds the mood ring)
                Yes!

                                 THOMAS J
                        (reacting to the bees)
                Ow, ahh, NO!, Get away!!!

        We see Thomas J's glasses fall off onto the ground

        OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR, SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, POLICEMAN PRESSES 
        DOORBELL, HARRY ANSWERS

        A policeman enters, takes his hat off and explains what has 
        happened to Thomas J to Harry, who becomes clearly very 
        distressed

        VADA'S ROOM, VADA IS FEEDING FISH, HARRY ENTERS

                                 HARRY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                What are you doing.

                                 VADA
                Feeding my fish.

                                 HARRY
                Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 HARRY
                He's getting big.
                        (sad pause)
                Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.

        Vada sits down next to her Dad

                                 HARRY
                Vada, something happened to Thomas J last 
                night, he stepped on a beehive.

                                 VADA
                        (beginning to look worried)
                I told him not to tease those bees. Did he 
                get stung?

        Harry nods

                                 VADA
                Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

                                 HARRY
                No sweetheart, you can't.

                                 VADA
                        (looking very worried)
                Why not?

                                 HARRY
                He was allergic to bees.

                                 VADA
                        (extremely worried)
                He's okay isn't he?

                                 HARRY
                        (shakes head, near tears)
                There were just too many of 'em.

        When Vada hears this, her eyes begin to flood with tears 
        and the expression on her face changes movingly, it looks as 
        though she just lost the most special and important part of 
        her life. And she has

        VADA RUNNING UP STAIRS INTO DOCTORS OFFICE

                                 VADA
                Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?

                                 VADA
                I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.

                                 DR WELTY
                Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, 
                come up here and we'll have a look.

        Dr. Welty lifts Vada up onto bed

                                 VADA
                It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.

                                 DR WELTY
                What Hurts Vada?

                                 VADA
                The bee stings! I can't breathe!

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY AND ARTHUR ARE BRINGING 
        THOMAS J IN ON A STRETCHER

        INSIDE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY IS CLIMBING 
        STAIRS CARRYING A TRAY OF FOOD, SHE STOPS OUTSIDE VADA'S 
        ROOM

                                 SHELLY
        Knocks Vada?

        View shifts to inside Vada's bedroom, where she is curled 
        up in a little ball on her bed

                I'm leaving some food for you by the door, in 
                case you get hungry.

        Vada remains where she is, the doorbell rings

        DOWNSTAIRS, SHELLY OPENS DOOR TO REVEAL JUDY

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 JUDY
                Hi, is Vada home?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's 
                not seeing anyone.

                                 JUDY
                Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I 
                wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.

                                 SHELLY
                Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of 
                days.

                                 JUDY
                Will you tell her I came by?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure.

                                 JUDY
                Thank you. Bye.

                                 SHELLY
                Bye.

        Shelly closes the door

        PEOPLE ARE ENTERING THE FUNERAL ROOM

                                 REV
                Hi Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, Reverand Miles.

                                 REV
                The Sennetts want to thank you for taking 
                care of things so quickly.

        THE FUNERAL ROOM IS FILLING UP, WITH THOMAS J AT THE FRONT 
        IN A COFFIN

        CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY STOPS OUTSIDE IT

                                 SHELLY
                        (knocks)
                Vada? I see you took your tray in,

        Vada is looking out her blinds at all the black cars and 
        people dressed in black entering her house

                Maybe you should come down for the funeral, 
                sometimes it helps. Vada?

        HARRY'S STUDY, HARRY IS LOOKING AT A PIECE OF PAPER, SHELLY 
        ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                She won't come out. It's been a whole day. 
                You have to do something Harry.

                                 HARRY
                The funeral's starting.

        Shelly is now very emotional

                                 SHELLY
                Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her 
                only friend in the world is dead.

                                 HARRY
                I know that, but what do you want from me?

                                 SHELLY
                Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I 
                first came here, the idea of working with dead 
                people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I 
                saw a family lived here, I thought, "if I'm 
                living without a family, at least I can work 
                with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be 
                invited in for supper."

                                 HARRY
                Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted 
                because there's a car crash, or there's a 
                fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those 
                people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't 
                ignore the living, especially your daughter.

        Arthur enters

                                 ARTHUR
                Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about 
                to begin.

                                 HARRY
                Thank you Arthur.

        FUNERAL ROOM, MINISTER IS WALKING UP THE FRONT

                                 MINISTER
                We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He 
                was born, May 7 1961, in Madison, 
                Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his 
                loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett......
                        (fades as camera changes)

        CAMERA IS ON VADA, WHO IS SLOWLY MAKING HER WAY OUT OF HER 
        ROOM

        The minister is heard to say this in the background

                                 MINISTER
                The family has asked me to say a few words 
                before we proceed. No words that I could say, 
                would begin to describe the loss and grieving, 
                one word that keeps ringing in my ear is 
                Why?. Why would God choose to take this 
                little boy from us? I can't give you an answer 
                to that question, but I can tell you that God 
                has chosen Thomas J for some very special 
                reason, we must find solace in knowing that 
                Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face, 
                there is no sorrow such as....

        The ministers words fade into the very moving music

        CAMERA IS ON VADA SLOWLY DESCENDING THE STAIRS AND LOOKING 
        INTO THE FUNERAL ROOM, THE MUSIC, SCENE AND ACTIONS OF 
        CHARACTERS IS GETTING TO THE POINT OF MAKING THE VIEWER CRY

        Vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through 
        and see Thomas J lying in his coffin, she begins to cry

        BACK IN FUNERAL ROOM, VADA ENTERS AT THE BACK AND BEGINS TO 
        SLOWLY MAKE HER WAY UP TO THE FRONT

                                 MINISTER
                ....disciples began to chastise them, and 
                Jesus said "Let the children come to me, do 
                not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God 
                belongs to such as these.
                        (the minister notices Vada 
                        coming around the front of the 
                        room)
                He laid his hands on their heads before he 
                left that place, let us pray in silence.

        Vada has made it right up to the coffin, which she leans 
        over and crying, says the following

                                 VADA
                Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?

        CAMERA DOES A CLOSE UP OF THOMAS J'S BEE STING COVERED FACE

        CAMERA GOES BACK TO PREVIOUS SHOT INCORPORATING VADA AS 
        WELL

                                 VADA
                His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He 
                can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses 
                on!
                        (Harry and Shelly are rapidly 
                        approaching Vada, Shelly takes 
                        hold of her and tries to pull 
                        her away)
                Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an 
                acrobat.

                                 HARRY
                He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!

                                 VADA
                Get away, get away!!

        Vada breaks away from Harry's grip and runs out of the 
        room, followed closely by Harry and Shelly

        OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, VADA IS RUNNING DOWN THE STEPS, FOLLOWED 
        CLOSELY BY HARRY

                                 HARRY
                Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!

        Harry stops running after Vada as she sprints off down the 
        road

        Vada arrives at Mr. Bixler's house

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are 
                you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

        Vada covers her ears and begins to sing "doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy"

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, 
                Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, 
                it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?

                                 VADA
                        (crying)
                Justin and Ronda say that I should tell 
                people what I feel.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                        (nods)
                Come here, sit down over here.

        The two of them sit down on Mr. Bixler's porch

        Vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop

                                 VADA
                Mr. Bixler,
                        (emotional pause)
                I love you.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Oh, Vada...

                                 VADA
                I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna 
                live here.

                                 MR. BIXLER
        Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss 
        you.

                                 VADA
                No he wouldn't, I can't go home.

        A woman appears at Mr. Bixler's front door

                                 SUZANNE
                I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem 
                to find my other earring....

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Suzanne, this is Vada.

                                 SUZANNE
                        (comes over to Vada and 
                        crouches)
                Vada, hi, I'm really sorry.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Could you just give us a minute?

                                 SUZANNE
                Yeah.

        Suzanne goes back inside

                                 VADA
                Who's that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                That's Suzanne.
                        (pause)
                She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

        As soon as Vada hears this, she reacts, shaking her head 
        and backing off

                                 VADA
                No....

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. 
                I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please 
                honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, 
                Vada sweetheart don't.....

                                 VADA
                Get away from me!

        Vada runs off down the road

        WEEPING WILLOW, VADA AND THOMAS J'S FAVORITE SPOT, VADA IS 
        UP HIGH IN THE TREE

        Vada is climbing around in the tree, clearly trying to get 
        somewhere of significance

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Why do you think people wanna get married?

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                When you get old, you just have to.

        Vada pulls out her photo of her mother

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                Who's that with your Dad?

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                It's my mother.

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
                        (pause)
                Vada, would you think of me? Well if you 
                don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Now we're blood brothers for life.

        Vada gets out to the end of a branch, and makes a daring 
        jump to another, had she fallen she would be dead

                                 POLICEMAN
                We'll keep looking.

                                 SHELLY
                We, no, we've been looking since this 
                morning, her teacher called, and he said that 
                she went there first.....

                                 POLICEMAN
                I know, I know you told us.

                                 SHELLY
                But I....

        Shelly is cut off as the door opens and in walks a very 
        shaken Vada

                                 SHELLY
                Vada. Are you okay?
                        (Vada nods)
                Oh God.

        Shelly embraces Vada

        VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY AND VADA ARE SITTING ON VADA'S BED, 
        SHELLY IS BRUSHING VADA'S HAIR

                                 VADA
                I should have told Thomas J that he was my 
                best friend.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm sure he knew.

        Shelly puts a nightie on Vada

                                 VADA
                Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie 
                jar, to pay for the writing class.

        Shelly ponders this for a moment

                                 SHELLY
                It's okay sweetheart.

                                 VADA
                I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll 
                ever go to class again.

                                 SHELLY
                I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first 
                book to me, and we'll forget about the whole 
                thing.

                                 VADA
                I will I promise.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay, get in to bed.

        Vada gets into bed and extends her arms to Shelly, they hug 
        each other, Vada has finally accepted Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

                                 VADA
                Goodnight.

        Shelly exits and turns off the lights

        DOWNSTAIRS, HARRY ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                        (sitting on stairs)
                She's in.

        BACK IN VADA'S ROOM

        Harry enters, walks over and kisses Vada, then turns around 
        and begins to exit

                                 VADA
                Did I kill my mother?

                                 HARRY
                What??

                                 VADA
                The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my 
                mother.

                                 HARRY
                No, no.

        Harry pulls up a chair and sits down next to Vada

                                 HARRY
                No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things 
                like that aren't anybody's fault, it just 
                happened.

        Vada pulls out the photo of Harry and Vada's Mom from under 
        her pillow

                                 VADA
                I found this.

                                 HARRY
                I forgot about that picture, where did you 
                find it?

                                 VADA
                In the garage.

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers 
                favorite car.

                                 VADA
                What was my mama like?

                                 HARRY
                She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. 
                Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when 
                you laugh, you sound just like her.

                                 VADA
                Really?

                                 HARRY
                Uh huh. You know what your mother did when 
                she found out she was gonna have you? She came 
                home and painted this whole room pink. She was 
                so sure she was gonna have a little girl.

                                 VADA
                Do you miss her?

                                 HARRY
                Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and 
                even now, I get a little sad when I think of a 
                pretty flower or a sunset that your mother 
                would have liked.

                                 VADA
                I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll 
                think of Thomas J.

                                 HARRY
                That's good, memories are good sweetheart. 
                Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from 
                you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and 
                I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump 
                like me.
                        (Vada puts the photo back 
                        under her pillow, Harry gets 
                        up and kisses her)
                Seeya in the morning.

        Harry begins to leave room

                                 VADA
                Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.

        A CAFE IN TOWN, HARRY IS EATING, MRS. SENNETT COMES AND 
        KNOCKS ON THE WINDOW

        Harry makes his way out of the cafe to talk to Mrs. Sennett

                                 HARRY
                Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Some days I think i'll be okay, others, well 
                I have to force myself even to get out of bed, 
                I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think he's 
                just away at summer camp. How's Vada?

                                 HARRY
                Oh she's doing much better. Ahh she's just 
                inside.
                        (walks over to entrance)

                VADA!

        Vada, who is inside talking to someone, hears and comes 
        outside

                                 VADA
                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she runs and gives her a 
                        hug)

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Vada. I've been wanting to come over to see 
                you,
                        (she reaches inside her purse 
                        and gets out something, it is 
                        Vada's mood ring)
                Thomas J had this on him, I thought you might 
                like to have it.

        Vada slides the ring onto her finger, the ring is BLUE

                You were such a good friend to him, I hope 
                you'll still come by and visit me.

                                 VADA
                I will, I promise.

        Mrs. Sennett looks at Harry as if to say good-bye, and then 
        walks off slowly

                                 VADA
                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she stops and turns around 
                        to look at Vada)
                Thomas J will be all right, my mother will 
                take care of him.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Thank you Vada.

        She then turns and walks off

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS, FOCUS ON MR. BIXLER

                                 MR. BIXLER
                        (reading from book)
                Encased in talent, like a uniform, the rank 
                of every poet, is well known. They can amaze 
                us like a thunderstorm, or die so young, or 
                live for years alone. My advice to you on our 
                last class, be a thunderstorm.

                                 JUSTIN
                What exactly do you mean by that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I mean, be dangerous
                        (Vada enters the back of the 
                        room)
                And unpredictable. And make a lot of noise.

        Mr. Bixler sees Vada

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada.

        As Vada is noticed, she goes around getting hugged by 
        everyone

                                 JUSTIN
                Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!

        Vada gives Justin a hug, she then proceeds towards Mr. 
        Bixler

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I was hoping you'd stop by today.

        Vada and Mr. Bixler hug each other

                                 VADA
                I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                We'd love to hear it.

                                 VADA
                Weeping willow with your tears running down, 
                Why do you always weep and frown, Is it 
                because he left you one day, Is it because he 
                could not stay, On your branches he would 
                swing, Do you long for the happiness that they 
                would bring, He found shelter in your shade, 
                He thought his laughter would never fade, 
                Weeping willow stop your tears, There is 
                something to calm your fears, You think death 
                as if you forever part, But I know he'll 
                always be in your heart.

        There is a long pause as it sinks in, everybody remains 
        silent, then just before the scene changes, the Temptations 
        song "My Girl" begins to play

        OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL, VADA COMES OUT THE DOOR AND DOWN THE 
        STEPS WHERE JUDY AWAITS HER

                                 VADA
                Hi Judy.

                                 JUDY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Things are a little better these days; I 
                finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and 
                I are gonna be in the same home room and the 
                republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon.

        Vada and Judy ride off down the road on their bikes, the 
        camera angle rises and the credits begin to roll as the song 
        My Girl plays

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back
     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We
     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF
     SCREEN.

     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

                               MICKEY
                    What kind of pies do you have?

                               MABEL
                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

                               MICKEY
                    Which do you recommend?

                               MABEL
                    The key lime is great, but it's
                    an acquired taste.

                               MICKEY
                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten
                    years.

                               MABEL
                    When ya had it, did ya like it?

                               MICKEY
                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a
                    completely different person ten years
                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in
                    court. And a large glass of milk.

     Mabel turns to her right.
 
                               MABEL
                         (to someone O.S.)
                    Should I make that two pieces?

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back
     is to the camera as well.

                               MALLORY
                    Nada, Rosey.

                               MABEL
                         (annoyed)
                    My name's not Rosey.
                         (points at name tag)
                    It's Mabel.

     Mabel exits FRAME.

                               MALLORY
                    Whatever.

     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next
     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,
     she selects a quarter.

                               MABEL
                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're
                    doin'?

     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes
     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
     shop.

     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

                               MABEL
                         (to Mickey)
                    She ought not be doing that. That's
                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time
     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

                               MICKEY
                    I can't take her anywhere.

     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
     hell these people are.

     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his
     pie and milk.

     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls
     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three
     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the
     pickup's hood.

                               EARL
                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.
                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er
                    out.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of
     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

                               SONNY
                    Good God almighty. What the hell is
                    that?

                               OTIS
                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.

     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

                               SONNY
                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next
     to Mickey.

                               SONNY
                    Miller, Mabel.

                               MABEL
                    Comin' up.

     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
     him.

     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a
     swig, enjoying the floor show.

                               SONNY
                         (to Mickey)
                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't
                    it?

     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression
     betrays nothing.

                               MICKEY
                    Her name's Mallory.

     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

                               OTIS
                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.
                    I'm just getting warmed up.

     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
     Sonny.

     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

                               SONNY
                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
     spinning him around.

     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the
     table, cracking the linoleum.

     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches
     hold of his shoulder.

     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points
     his finger at him, threateningly.

     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.
     Blood flows from the wound.

                               MICKEY
                    Just because my woman's mopping up the
                    floor with your buddy is no reason for
                    you to join in.

     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck
     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be
     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices
     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,
     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
     his jacket and FIRES.

     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It
     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
     the ground, screaming.

     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass
     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the
     ground dead.

     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING
     his head repeatedly on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Honey.

     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to
     Mickey's side.

     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
     pot, crying.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Pick one.

     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

                               MALLORY
                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a
                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let
                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My
                    mom told me to pick the best one and
                    you are it.

     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

                               MABEL
                    NO!

     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She
     hits the floor dead.

     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

                               MALLORY
                    When you tell people what went on here,
                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did
                    this. Understand?

     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.
     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

     INT. COUPE DE VILLE - MOVING - DAY

     Mickey and Mallory in a flashy '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.
     Duane Eddy's 'REBEL ROUSER' blares on the soundtrack. The B.G.
     is an outrageous PROCESS SHOT. The titles splash over this
     image 50's style.

     When this sequence is over, we CUT TO BLACK.

     END CREDIT SEQUENCE

     Over black screen, we hear:

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI
                    Send Scagnetti in here.

     INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY

     CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in
     the middle of the frame.

     JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's
     office. Squeri's never seen.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room
                    C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the
                    prison board, is waiting to meet you.
                    You're gonna deliver two prisoners from
                    the county jail to Nystrom Insane
                    Asylum in Bakersfield.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    This is bullshit. I'm a detective.
                    You want an errand boy, call Jerry
                    Lewis.

     Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door
     shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Jack!

     INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

     Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,
     wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

     PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already
     tied tie over his head.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY

     DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,
     stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.
     In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

     McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,
                    Scagnetti. You put an end to a
                    nightmare. The ladies of this city can
                    get to sleep again, and they have you
                    to thank.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thank you, sir.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Dewight McClusky of the California
                    Prison Board. Take a seat please.

     Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation
     table.

                               MCCLUSKY
                         (referring to book)
                    This is damn good reading. I'm
                    surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.
                    This would make a better movie than
                    that 'Serpico' shit.

     McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The
     Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.
     McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He
     lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    I think you'll find that good reading
                    as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.
                    You familiar with them?

     Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs
     of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who isn't?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You been followin' the news coverage?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've been separated since their
                    incarceration in a couple of
                    penitentiaries---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Susanville, Soledade.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've killed a shitload of inmates
                    and guards---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Five inmates, eight guards and one
                    psychiatrist all in one year's time...
                    Very good. You do keep up with the
                    headlines.

     Scagnetti nods.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Look, our situation in a nutshell is,
                    no prison wants 'em, no prison will
                    take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,
                    where the warden's as hard as a bar of
                    iron. No one wants those fuckin'
                    assholes behind their walls, dealin'
                    with 'em day in, day out.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I can appreciate that.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    So can we. So the solution to our
                    little problem is we had them deemed
                    crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to
                    Nystrom Asylum for the criminally
                    insane.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Lobotomy Bay?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You've heard of it?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, how do I fit into this scheme?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The public loves you Jack...You don't
                    mind if I call you Jack, do you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    By all means.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six
                    years on the force, a best-seller out on
                    paperback...

     McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent
                    lawman with a deadly axe to grind with
                    maniacs.

     McClusky lowers the book.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a breathing icon of justice and
                    that's why you were chosen to deliver
                    Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison
                    board we, knows that once you get them
                    on the road if anything should happen,
                    an escape attempt, an accident, fire,
                    anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti
                    would be there to look out for his
                    public's best interests.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I see.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You write the script Jack, call it,
                    'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination
                    of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...
                    Have we found our man?

     Hold on Scagnetti.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY

     SCAGNETTI'S POV: McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He
     BANGS on it with is fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through
     this scene.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through
                    with a visitor!

     A BUZZER SOUNDS

     McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As
     soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the
     song 'Long Time Woman'.

     McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my
                    years with the penal institution, and
                    I'll tell ya that's no small number,
                    Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a
                    doubt the most twisted, depraved group
                    of fucks it's ever been my displeasure
                    to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two
                    rat shits are a walkin' reminder of
                    just how fucked up our system really
                    is.

     The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Who's the song bird?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Mickey's better half herself. Mallory
                    Knox. This little lady drowned her
                    father in a fish tank.

     INSERT: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CU of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly
     Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

                               MCCLUSKY
                    While the two together burned her
                    mother alive in her bed.

     INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MEDIUM CU of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open.
     What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME,
     pouring gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags.
     CAMERA PANS up and we see Mickey holding a gas can.

     CU of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in
     front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV:

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Why?

     McClusky's still walking ahead of us.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Because they wouldn't give them their
                    blessing for marriage.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Ain't love grand.

     McClusky laughs.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's
     file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color
     of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that
     is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

     As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

                               FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)
                    When pressed about the reason for the
                    murders...patient became hostile...

     INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine
     dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly
     at the CAMERA.

                               MALLORY
                    I don't owe you an explanation! I don't
                    owe you shit! I'm not here for your
                    entertainment. If I don't tell you
                    what you wanna hear, what are you gonna
                    do? Throw me in jail? I'm already
                    there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna
                    give me some more time? I've already
                    got life. What else you got to
                    threaten me with? Death? I'd like to
                    see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one
                    motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

     BACK TO DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:

     Still on SCAGNETTI'S POV:

     We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a
     cell door.

     We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell.

     We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures
     toward the cell.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Here she is...you know her, you
                    love her, you can't live without
                    her...Mallory Knox.

     We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see
     Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing.

     INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY

     CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    99 years is a long, long time. Look at
                    me, I will never be free, I'm a long time
                    woman...

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to
                    meet you.

     Mallory just keeps on truckin'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Been workin' on the road now.
                    Been workin' by the sea.
                    Been workin' in the cane fields.
                    and I wanna be free...

     MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second.
     Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory
     screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV
     flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

     MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

     CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jesus Christ!

     CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Don't worry about it. She does that
                    all the time.

     BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood
     trickling down her scalp.

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Follow me.

     INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY

     CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti
     approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.

     PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                    You duckin' me Dewight?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    This son of a bitch is chairman of the
                    prison board, but it's like pullin'
                    teeth to get him down to a prison.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The only reason I'm here now is to set
                    him straight, and I'm on the next
                    flight out.
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    Jack, this is the superintendent of the
                    jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man
                    who's got the power of the pen here.

     Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

                               WURLITZER
                    Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your
                    book. I'm impressed. Good work on
                    Curtis Fox.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thanks.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    From now on, you'll be dealin' with
                    Phil. He can answer all the questions
                    you got about the arrangements. I'm
                    gonna be bidding you good luck and
                    adieu in about twenty minutes. My
                    flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in
                    a hour.

                               WURLITZER
                    And I want you to know, we'll all cry a
                    river when you're gone.

     They all laugh.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What's the travelling arrangements?

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be
                    together. So, we'll put you on one of
                    our prison busses and you'll take
                    Mallory first, then you'll come back
                    for Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    And where do you keep Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,
                    darkest cell in the whole place. But
                    it just so happens that right now he's
                    got a special visitor.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who?

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne Gayle.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (surprised)
                    Wayne Gayle!

     INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la
     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.
     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a
     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

                               WAYNE
                         (into recorder)
                    Testing one...two...three...
                    testing...one...three...over,
                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It
     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the
     recorder in his sport coat jacket.

     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
     and feet are double cuffed.

     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
     intimidating, and fascinating figure.

     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                         (to himself)
                    Showtime.

     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of
     the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by
     the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello Mickey. We've never been
                    introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I
                    don't know if you've ever heard of me
                    or remember me. I was one of the
                    reporters outside the courthouse during
                    your trial---

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody knows who you are. You're
                    famous.

     Wayne pauses and retorts.

                               WAYNE
                    I could say the same thing about you.
                         (smiles)
                    I want to thank you very much for
                    seeing me...

     Mickey is silent.

                               WAYNE
                    I have a television show. It's very
                    popular. Every week we do a profile on
                    a different serial killer. You don't
                    mind if I call you a serial killer, do
                    you?

     Mickey shakes his head no.

                               WAYNE
                    The episode we did on Mickey and
                    Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               MICKEY
                    Whose ratings were higher?

                               WAYNE
                    Yours.

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on
                    him?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

                               MICKEY
                    Good...yuppie piece of shit.

                               WAYNE
                    What I'd like to do---

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Manson?

                               WAYNE
                    Manson beat you.

                               MICKEY
                    Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the
                    king.

                               WAYNE
                    We've been waiting to do a follow up
                    episode on you for a long time. And
                    that time has definitely come.
                         (pause)
                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
                    hip to what's going on that the prison
                    board has thrown the constitution
                    straight out the fuckin' window.
                    You and Mallory may be killers, but
                    you're not insane. You belong in a
                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison
                    board is blatantly railroading you into
                    a hospital for the sole purpose of
                    turning you into vegetables. Now some
                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
                    one of those people. If we avert our
                    eyes while they do this to you, we give
                    them permission to do it again whenever
                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean
                    your mind because they feel your
                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
                    wipe clean my mind because they feel
                    what I say is dangerous. Where does
                    it all stop?

     No response from Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't
                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
                    on this. I need your help. I want
                    what the prison board is doing to be
                    the focus of our follow up episode.
                    Now I have interviews with chairman of
                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about
                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two
                    psychologists they used for their
                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
                    to us, which always looks bad. I have
                    an interview with both the judge of
                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
                    psychologist and author, Emil
                    Reinghold, both of which discount the
                    notion that you're insane. You put
                    that all together, and what the state
                    is doing becomes obvious. But the
                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the
                    show needs another element. It needs
                    you. In order to put the show on the
                    air, I need to get an interview with
                    you. You haven't talked to the press
                    since your trial. Now, a few days
                    before you get transferred to an
                    asylum, you grant an interview on
                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're
                    talkin' a media event here. Every son
                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's
                    gonna tune in to see that.
                    We'll make their motives so blatant,
                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
                    thing. At least for a little while,
                    the publicity would keep them from just
                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
                    Well, whatta ya say?

                               MICKEY
                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?

                               WAYNE
                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now
                    you're not supposed to know anything
                    about what's going on with her, but I'm
                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you
                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't
                    spoken one word.

                               MICKEY
                    She doesn't talk?

                               WAYNE
                    Not to anybody. She sings.

                               MICKEY
                    She sings? What does she sing?

                               WAYNE
                    Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The
                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty
                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be
                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.
                    Her behaviour was the main thing the
                    doctors' report used against you. So
                    even if she would see me, which she
                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera
                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are
                    you insane?' And she starts singing
                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',
                    that blows our whole case.

     Mickey cracks a smile.

     The guards come over to take him away.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Time, motherfucker!

     They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an
                    answer.

     Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

                               WAYNE
                         (yells after him)
                    Just think about it. But don't think
                    too long.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a
     letter.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.
                    At night I get the chills. I pretend
                    you're lying next to me, holding me
                    from behind with your leg draped over
                    mine and your arms wrapped tightly
                    around me. I lie in my cell...

     DISSOLVE TO:

     WIDE SHOT in cell behind Mickey. We slowly DOLLY back.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    ...and imagine kissing you. Not
                    making love, just kissing for hours and
                    hours on end. I remember everything
                    about our time. I remember every joke
                    you ever told.

     CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    I remember every secret you ever
                    shared. Shared or revealed? I think
                    shared is proper. I remember every
                    single time you laughed.

     ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear
     Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember every meal we ever ate. I
                    remember your cooking. I especially
                    remember your casseroles. I remember
                    watching David Letterman.

     We hear the echo of television laughter.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember driving fast...faster,
                    man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe
                    de Ville.

     The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

     CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory,
     driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through
     their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around
     Mickey and kisses.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet
                    up on the dash, singing along with the
                    radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A
                    Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of

     the hood of the car.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    And your dancing, my God, your dancing.
                    I lie on my bed and go over every day,
                    every minute of our happiness. Every
                    day take a day of our time and go
                    through it hour by hour. I don't jump
                    ahead either. I take it as it comes,
                    and I live that day again. That way
                    when I get to our first kiss...

     The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear

                    The killing of your parents, our
                    wedding...They're not just memories.
                    I feel that joy again...

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face
     and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over
     Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

                               WAYNE
                         (reading out loud)
                    'After taking a few days to reflect on
                    your offer, I've come to the conclusion
                    that you are one hundred percent
                    correct. A national TV interview would
                    be very advantageous to both Mallory
                    and I. The only obstacle is they're
                    shipping me out to the funny farm in
                    four days. However, that is your
                    problem and not mine. I feel confident
                    you'll manage. Here's to us making
                    television history. Sincerely, Mickey
                    Knox.'

     Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

                               WAYNE
                    Am I a God or what?

     We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's
     decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
     remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they
     all pretend they are praying to him.

     The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild
     t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On
     Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears
     wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,
     Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a
     baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
     weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his
     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie
     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are
     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's
     stylish yuppie demeanour.

     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold
     out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks
     straight from the bottle.

     NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl
     Friday' pace.

                               WAYNE
                    Drink up! This is a celebration. This
                    is the day we received word we were
                    gonna make television history. We're
                    gonna have the first sit down, in depth
                    interview with the most charismatic
                    serial killer ever, one day before he's
                    being shipped to a mental hospital for
                    the rest of his life. This is one of
                    those golden moments that happens maybe
                    only four times in a lucky journalist's
                    career. This is Wallace with Noriega,
                    this is Elton John confessing his
                    bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this
                    is the tearful reporting of the
                    Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut
                    setting the record straight on
                    Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,
                    this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting
                    Deep Throat in an underground parking
                    lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The
                    Ten Days That Shook The World', this is
                    the hippies' bloody palms at Kent
                    State, the Maysles brothers at
                    Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost
                    interviews...

                               ROGER
                    This is Raymond Burr witnessing the
                    destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

     Everybody laughs.

                               SCOTT
                    What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

     As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.
     She never speaks, just writes.

                               WAYNE
                    We got tonight and tomorrow to get our
                    shit together. The day after that
                    they're shippin' Mallory. That's when
                    we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause
                    the next day he goes.

                               SCOTT
                    Would the network really not run it
                    without the interview?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The last thing they
                    expected was Mickey Knox to get up
                    close and personal. They wanted a
                    follow up episode and would've taken
                    anything I had given them. I'm not
                    gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna
                    make him think his grey matter depends
                    on it. When I told Woody and the brass
                    about this coup, they practically shit
                    a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.
                    They want to expand the show to a hour,
                    and they want it on immediately.

                               ROGER
                    How immediate is immediately?

                               WAYNE
                    Next week's episode.

     Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.

                               ROGER
                    We don't got enough footage for a hour
                    follow up.

                               SCOTT
                         (pointing at Roger)
                    What he said.

                               WAYNE
                    Rape and pillage the first episode,
                    just change the order a bit. Those
                    sons of bitches out there ain't gonna
                    know the difference. All that shit is
                    just filler for the interview anyway.
                    We film a new intro. Show some old
                    footage from the first episode so the
                    get a brief history of Mickey and
                    Mallory. We introduce a new angle...
                    what the prison board is up to. We
                    see some of that new shit, then the
                    rest of the show is the interview. Now
                    what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,
                    Julie make a note: I need Woody to get
                    me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'
                    broadcast to promote next weeks show.
                    We'll do a feed right from the jail
                    while we're wrapping up with Mickey.

     Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    You too Scott, Betacam and a remote,
                    keep it simple.

     Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.

                               SCOTT
                    Betacam with remote and two-way comm
                    link. Got it.
                         (opens eyes)
                    How about the interview...What camera
                    do you want to use?

     Wayne closes his eyes.
 
                               WAYNE
                    I see...high contrast sixteen
                    millimetre black and white, and I mean
                    black and white, where the black's
                    black and the white's white. This is
                    for posterity, so fuck video. Film!
                    Film! Film!

     Wayne pounds on the table. CU of Unruly Julie writing in her
     notebook: 'Film...film...film!'

                               WAYNE
                    So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and
                    planning the interview.
                         (points at Roger & Scott)
                    You two go down to the editing bay,
                    take the old footage and the new
                    footage, put it together, and see what
                    we got. Get it into shape so when we
                    finish the interview, we can just stick
                    it in.

                               SCOTT
                    When do you want the assembly?

                               WAYNE
                    Tomorrow.

     INT. TV STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

     CAMERA leads Wayne, who's talking to Unruly Julie. As they
     march quickly through the halls Julie writes furiously in her
     notebook.

                               WAYNE
                    At that point I'll ask him if he
                    believes in God. If he says yes, I'll
                    ask him what he thinks God would make
                    of his actions. And is he worried
                    about burning in hell? If he says no,
                    I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you
                    believe in?' And hopefully he'll say
                    something like a live round of ammo,
                    the expression on the face of a man he
                    just split up the middle, Mallory's
                    eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.
                    He's bound to say something
                    provocative.

     Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and
     Roger are sitting at the editing bay. Everybody is wearing, and
     looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before,
     except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, boys, let's have it.

                               SCOTT
                    Well, basically, what we did was put
                    part of the old show on first...

                               ROGER
                    But we changed the order around so it
                    wasn't super obvious...

                               SCOTT
                    Then we added the new shit to the
                    tail...

                               ROGER
                    So we film the interview, and we can
                    just slap it on at the end.

     Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE is standing in the middle of an empty highway. The
     CAMERA looks up from the ground. With a WIDE ANGLE lens, he
     looks practically mythic.

     Wayne speaks into the camera.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello. Welcome to 'American Maniacs'.
                    I'm your host Wayne Gayle. And this is
                    Highway 58.

                    point A and point B. To others a
                    beautiful stretch to the American
                    landscape. But to Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox, it was a candy land of murder and
                    mayhem.

     While we hear Wayne's narration, we see a MONTAGE of home 8mm
     movie footage. These are films of Mickey and Mallory living a
     normal life.

     ground near them, holding his hands over his face, screaming.

     To the left Mallory is slugging it out with a windbreaker COP,
     matching each other blow for blow.

     Meanwhile, the three cops we ran with reach the action and join

                    kill everybody when they're through,
                    except for one clerk. There were a
                    couple of people in the store then, and
                    I was working with Stevo. And I like

     Mickey and Mallory charge into a 7/11 store, cocking their
     shotguns and shouting things.

     Mickey SHOOTS a CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

     Mallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

     Mickey points his shotgun at Bishop the store clerk and screams:

                    Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast!
                    Faster! Faster! Faster than that!

     Bishop stuffs money in a bag as Mallory guards the door, shotgun
     ready.

     STEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room
     carrying boxes and wearing a walkman.

     Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him.

     As all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes, Wayne's
     narration happens over it.

                    The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder
                    trial was so event filled it made the
                    crime spree that took place before pale
                    by comparison. The first point was the
                    decision of Mickey's to act as his own
                    council. Now this in itself is not
                    unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy
                    acted as his own council as well. What
                    was unexpected was how well Mickey's
                    performance would be.

                    We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was
                    the presiding judge during the Knox
                    trial.

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Mickey was surprisingly effective.
                    When I was told I was to be the judge
                    of this trial and then I was told
                    Mickey Knox would be handling his own
                    defence, I got a headache that lasted
                    five days. But at first I breathed a
                    sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very
                    prepared, and proved to be an excellent
                    amateur lawyer.

                    the state's prosecutor on this case,

                    up very prepared and proved to be an
                    excellent amateur attorney.

                               BISBING
                    Oh, that's rich. Well, considering
                    that Mickey Knox turn his court into
                    a mockery and personally made him look
                    like a fool, I'd say that's very
                    benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far
                    as Mickey being an excellent amateur
                    lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but
                    when I went to law school, we were
                    taught the object was to win the case,

                    two shit asses (BLEEP) the stiffest
                    sentence the law allows. I want to see
                    their faces when the state says 'they
                    are the worst scum sucking, degenerate,
                    douche bag, filthy, I don't know what's

                    And these assholes (BLEEP) are making
                    heroes outta sickos. You wanna know
                    who a hero is? You wanna know? I'll
                    tell ya who a Goddamn hero is. Mike
                    Griffin. Mike fuckin' (BLEEP) Griffin
                    is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP)
                    should be revering. You know why Mike
                    Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya
                    why. Because he was killed in the line
                    of duty. Do you want to know how he
                    died?

                               INTENSE COP

     Wayne's sitting in the gym. Behind him MUSCLE MEN are working
     out. Their GRUNTING sounds fill the background. Wayne looks up
     and just OFF CAMERA to the people he's interviewing.

                               WAYNE
                    What do you think of Mickey and
                    Mallory?

     ECU on SIMON and NORMAN HUN, two brothers/bodybuilders, in a
     head SHOT.

                               SIMON
                    I admire them.

                               NORMAN
                    I do, too.

                               WAYNE
                         (confused)
                    But how can you say that?

                               SIMON
                    They're mesmerising.

                               NORMAN
                    Hypnotizing.

                               SIMON
                    Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               NORMAN
                    Then you've seen the scene where Arnold
                    Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou
                    Ferigno.

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               SIMON
                    Through the power of the simple word---

                               NORMAN
                    And a snake-eye glare.

                               SIMON
                    ---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was
                    able to totally psyche out any
                    confidence Ferigno had.

                               NORMAN
                    He squashed him mentally before
                    physically defeating him.

                               SIMON
                    He had the edge. The mind's edge.

                               NORMAN
                    Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

                               SIMON
                    Only on a much grander scale.

                               NORMAN
                    They've hypnotized the nation.

                               SIMON
                    Schwartzenegger was the king of the
                    edge before they came along.

     The CU of the brothers ZOOMS back.

                    You say this and yet...you two are
                    both victims of Mickey and Mallory.

     SHOT has zoomed back to reveal that both Simon and Norman are in
     wheelchairs (their legs maimed or gone).

                               SIMON
                    Yes.

                               NORMAN
                    Yes.

                               WAYNE
                    How can you say that you 'admire' them?

                               NORMAN
                    It's like this, Wayne. Two people are
                    standing in a dark room waiting for the
                    other to attack. These two people
                    can't see each other, yet they know
                    they're there. Now, they can either
                    stand in the dark room forever waiting
                    until they die of boredom, or one of
                    them can make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    Why can't they just shake hands and be
                    friends?

                               NORMAN
                    They can't because neither knows if the
                    other is a deranged senseless killer
                    like the Knoxs. So, you may as well
                    make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    And they made the first move?

                               NORMAN
                    Unfortunately, yes.

                               SIMON
                    But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    Why?

                               SIMON
                    They passed the 'edge' along to us.

                               WAYNE
                    How so?

                               SIMON
                    By taking away our legs. Now we have
                    to fight harder to get ahead than
                    anyone else you'll find in this gym.
                    Probably the whole city. They gave us
                    the fighting spirit. Before this
                    happened I was content. Now I'm pissed
                    off. Now I'm half a man and I've got
                    to work like the devil to get whole
                    again.

                               WAYNE
                    But you'll never be whole again.

                               SIMON
                    Never is a very long time, Wayne. A
                    word only the weak use. I'm not a sore
                    loser. Even if I don't have a leg to
                    stand on, I'm going to get up and fight
                    this world until I'm on top again.

                               NORMAN
                    That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

                               SIMON
                    That's the way of the world.

                               NORMAN
                    They're shocking the world into
                    remembering the primal law.

                               SIMON
                    Survival of the fittest.

                               WAYNE
                    One last question. Usually Mickey and
                    Mallory kill all of their victims. Why
                    did they let you two survive?

     The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

                               NORMAN
                    They had us tied down during one of
                    their house raids, you've seen the
                    headlines, and they were taking a
                    chainsaw to our legs before they were
                    gonna kill us.

                               SIMON
                    Just for fun, I guess.

                               NORMAN
                    And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,
                    'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

                               SIMON
                    Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,
                    'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

                               NORMAN
                    Apparently, they've seen all our films.

                               SIMON
                    They were especially influenced by
                    'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

                               NORMAN
                    So, Mallory calls 911 and they took
                    off.

                               SIMON
                    They actually apologized.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

     Wayne enters an editing room where filmmaker NEIL POPE is
     working at a movieola.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We talked with Neil Pope, writer and
                    director of 'Thrill Killers' for his
                    take on the Mickey and Mallory
                    phenomena.

     Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets
     Wayne M.O.S.

     CUT INTO INTERVIEW:

                               NEIL POPE
                    It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox are a cultural phenomena that
                    could only exist in our sexually
                    repressed society. A flower that could
                    only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
                    culture. A what I tried to do with
                    'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of
                    the problem all the way down the vine
                    to the original bad seed. Yet amidst
                    the violence and murder and carnage,
                    you've got the structure of a Wagnerian
                    love story.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.
     The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,
     shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,
     where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up
     against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the
     subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, honey, listen to me.

     Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,
                    but--

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't run with you, Mickey! I really
                    want to. If I could, I would, but I
                    can't. I gotta stay here. But you can
                    still get out of here.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    If they stay, they'll catch you, and
                    they don't have to catch you---

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, you're wasting time!

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I don't give a damn if a million United
                    States marines, all whistling the halls
                    of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'
                    down this alley any second. There
                    ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm
                    leaving you. And that's that!

     Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

     The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, my love, if you leave me,
                    they'll catch me and take me to the
                    hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em
                    kill you. Then it'd be like I killed
                    you. I could bear anything, but I
                    couldn't bear that. So please, please,
                    for me, my handsome
                    husband, run for your life.

     The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I can't do it. You're my wife, you're
                    my partner. A fella doesn't run when
                    his partner can't run with him.
                    Mallory, my angel, if I could of left
                    ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

     They kiss.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me
                    a gun so I can go out shooting.

     Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little
                    tougher for 'em.

     Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the
     corner at the arriving COPS.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                         (to himself)
                    Time to get naked and boogie.

     Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,
     then places the barrel under her chin.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey!

     Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Yeah baby.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    You made every day like kindergarten.

     Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

     DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

     Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless
     body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

     Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Mallory!

                                                    CUT TO:

     BACK TO: THE POPE INTERVIEW

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Why did you kill Mallory? Both of
                    them are still alive.

                               NEIL POPE
                    It was dramatic license, no doubt. But
                    I felt an operatic love story needed an
                    operatic ending. The two of them kill
                    for each other. They offer the death
                    of their victims to each other like
                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.
                    So what more natural, what more
                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory
                    offering her death to Mickey? It's
                    where it's been leading since day one.
                    We worked it in the movie by using a
                    what if they escaped situation. I
                    think it works beautifully. You'd be
                    surprised. People come up to me at the
                    end of the movie in tears.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks
     to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna
     is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.
     His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               JESSIE
                    One thing about Mickey for sure, he's
                    definitely a man who has his moments.
                    It was wild playin' him. It was one of
                    those get-it-out-of-your-system
                    performances.

     INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY

     This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.
     BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her
     lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name
     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               BUFFY
                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I
                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played
                    her as a woman in love, who also
                    happens to murder people. I didn't
                    want her to be at arm's length from the
                    audience or myself. If you play her as
                    this wild maniac, the audience never
                    has to deal with her. If you see a
                    decapitation in a movie, you just say
                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'
                    Because you can't relate to a
                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything
                    to anybody because it's not personal.
                    Decapitations don't fall into most
                    people's realm of life experiences.
                    But if you show somebody in a movie
                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience
                    squirms. Because everybody can relate
                    to a paper cut.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

                               BUFFY
                    I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.
                    But I read some letters she wrote to
                    Mickey before the murder spree. They
                    helped me out a lot.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Jessie talks to CAMERA.

                               WAYNE (O.S)
                    You met Mickey Knox, didn't you?

                               JESSIE
                    Yeah, I visited him when he was up in
                    Susanville. He's a little cerebral for
                    my taste, but all in all, we got along.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.
     REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    To get a psychiatric view on the
                    strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
                    seems to have, we talked with Doctor
                    Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and
                    author.

     Wayne begins his interview.

                               WAYNE
                    Can you shed some light, Doctor
                    Reinghold, on why the public has taken
                    a pair of sociopaths so close to their
                    bosom?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Well, for one, the media has done a
                    tremendous job of turning the husband
                    and wife mass murderers into
                    celebrities. But it's the country's
                    youth who have turned the couple into
                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
                    the very thing that makes them most
                    lethal is the exact same thing that
                    captures the public's hearts and
                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
                    devotion to each other. In a world
                    where people can't seem to make the
                    simplest relationships work and the
                    slightest emotional commitment is
                    considered devastating, Mick and
                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the
                    country's youth, 75 percent of which
                    are coming from broken homes, that's
                    appealing. They have an 'us against
                    the world' posture which always appeals
                    to youth. And they've taken that
                    posture seventeen steps beyond.
                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's
                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
                    exciting. I read their file and I find
                    myself turning the page like it was a
                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
                    disillusioned housewives read romance
                    novels? Why are you filming this
                    special? Because you know as well as I
                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to
                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey
                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb
                    with violence. They've created a world
                    where only two exist and anybody who
                    inadvertently enters that world is
                    murdered.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    This attitude from the young towards
                    their ultimate anti-heroes is nation
                    wide. And spreading.

     SIX TEENS DURING SLUMBER PARTY!' In smaller bold face under it:

                    Of the six teens murdered that night,
                    seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was
                    the lucky one left to tell the tale.
                    And this haunted young lady summoned up
                    the courage to take the stand, tell
                    what she saw that horrible night, and
                    then allow herself to be cross-examined
                    by the man who killed her brother and
                    girlfriends.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media
     event.

     Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators
     and reporters surround the car.

     Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start
     walking up the courthouse steps.

     Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask
     questions.

     Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the
     direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

     She remains silent and scared.

     Grace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the
     crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we
     hear the cry of:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mickey and Mallory!

     CAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying
     Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps
     they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit.

     Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by
     SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them
     and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their
     faces.

                    Grace was terrified of Mickey. You
                    have to understand most of their
                    victims were normal people with normal

                    with the devil incarnate. It was

                    survivors who would take the stand and

     Mallory at the defence table. Judge Steinsma looks down at
     Grace. The distinct sounds of a court in session can be heard

     The color of the scene FADES to Black & White as the CAMERA
     cranes up to reveal the COURT ARTIST drawing while court is in

                    When you study the martial arts, they
                    give out belts that come in different
                    colors to signify what level you're at
                    in your training. Am I correct on that

                               GRACE
                    Yes you are.

                               MICKEY
                    What was the color of Tim's belt?

                    The style of fighting that Tim studied
                    didn't believe in belts.

                               MICKEY
                    Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,
                    could you tell us what form of martial
                    arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

                               GRACE
                    Tim studied several styles, but his
                    favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

                               MICKEY
                    Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research
                    on that form of fighting, and I found
                    out that Jeet Kune Do was a style
                    developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know
                    that?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.
                    Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting
                    style.

                    Now, while I freely admit total
                    ignorance on the subject, I have heard
                    of Bruce Lee. And I was under the
                    impression that Bruce Lee was one of
                    the, if not the greatest fighter in the
                    history of martial arts.

                               GRACE
                    That's what Tim said.

                               MICKEY
                    So, I think it would be safe to say
                    that anybody who studied the fighting

                    greatest martial artist of all times,
                    developed for nine years, that would be
                    a fella who could defend himself.
                    Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I would.

     Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand.

                               MICKEY
                    Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands
                    registered as lethal weapons?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, they were.

                               MICKEY
                    That means his hands are considered a
                    weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I
                    correct on that point?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, you are.

     CU of Mallory cracking a slight smile.

                    Yet, in your testimony just now, you
                    described that Tim...

                    like that?

                    think you have a definite opinion on
                    how I was able to do those things you
                    described. Now, I'm going to ask you
                    again. And I want you to remember you
                    are under oath.

                    I able to murder you brother Tim

                    After the deadly brewhaha in the
                    courtroom, the judge, honorable Burt
                    Steinsma, passed down a sentence that
                    was to make legal history.

     INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

     Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home.

     M.O.S. SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at
                    his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

     The interview:

                               WAYNE
                    Was there any vengeance on your part
                    with your unique sentence?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Yes, unquestionably. After they did
                    what they did in my court, and judge
                    worth his robe will tell you the same
                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my
                    decision. That's why they have judges.
                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
                    but when it's showtime, we have to make
                    a decision. That's why we don't just
                    input all the facts into a computer for
                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
                    give them the death penalty. See,
                    California hops back and forth on that
                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
                    court when it was out of favor, which
                    is actually good because it leaves more
                    room for imagination. Anybody can give
                    somebody the chair. When you have
                    someone who deserves to die and you
                    can't kill them, you have to be
                    creative. And if the bastards had let
                    it stand, it would of been the perfect
                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they
                    lived. Far more punishing than the
                    death sentence.

                               WAYNE
                    Would you please describe for our
                    viewers what your sentence was?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,
                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day
                    and they're a very cold lot. They have
                    no more feelings about taking a
                    person's life than squashing a tiny
                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
                    to watch their expression change'
                    attitude personified. Except with each
                    other. And, since they lived only for
                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at
                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
                    sentence was double life for each
                    without any possibility for parole.
                    That would be fairly standard in their
                    case. The twist I added was that the
                    husband and wife would have no contact
                    or correspondence with each other for
                    the rest of their lives. And they
                    would never receive any word or
                    information about the other.
                    So, basically once the cell door slams
                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will
                    completely disappear from each other's
                    life. They'll never know when the
                    other dies. But alas, the best laid
                    plans of mice and men...

                    The sentence was never to reach that
                    point. Because after only a year,

                    Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
                    to an asylum? And who made the
                    decision?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board made the decision. A
                    board of which I belong. We're the
                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and
                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully
                    they'll receive the help they need.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed
                    competent in a mental examination
                    before their trial. I'm confused.
                    What's changed?

                    Well, since that time, they've killed
                    one person during their trail. And
                    since their incarceration, they've
                    killed one psychologist along with
                    several guards and inmates.

                               WAYNE
                    When they were found competent before,
                    they had already killed fifty people.
                    Other than the fact they're a
                    disciplinary problem, which frankly
                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still
                    don't see where this situation is any
                    different then it was before. So, I
                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's
                    changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our
                    minds. We felt they were competent a
                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a
                    year where they were under close
                    observation, day in and day out, and
                    their behaviour has led us to believe we
                    were wrong.

                               WAYNE
                    Who is we?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board and the doctors who
                    examined them.

                               WAYNE
                    Were any of the doctors who made the
                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
                    state asked to re-examine them?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Using the same doctors is not common
                    practice.

                               WAYNE
                    I take it by your answer it was a whole
                    new team?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They
                    were different men. I hadn't really
                    thought that much about it. Since many
                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,
                    sought out for this kind of situation.
                    What do you think normally happens?
                    The Knoxs are assigned a family
                    psychologist that takes care of them
                    throughout the rest of their lives?
                    The state doesn't work like that.

                    good doctors, for whatever reason,

     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    It's a funny situation actually. If
                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
                    a damn, what the prison board is doing
                    would be considered an outrage. The
                    prison board is basically saying, 'We
                    can't handle these guys.' They've
                    moved 'em around twice since their
                    sentence started.
                    They were a handful everywhere they
                    went. Now the prisons they're at now
                    want them outta there. But no other
                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
                    'em. So the prison board is left
                    scratching their heads wondering what
                    they're gonna do. Well, what they
                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
                    medical court that found them crazy.
                    Then they get them transferred to
                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric
                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and
                    Mallory cease to be a problem to
                    anybody except the orderlies who clean
                    out the bedpans, which if you want to
                    see them get theirs, that's all well
                    and good. But there's something being
                    said here. Forget the immorality for a
                    second. Forget the corruption and the
                    skulduggery involved. What the board
                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and
                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.
                    They were put in an alternative society
                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the
                    powers that be, can't deal with these
                    two kids. And whatever can't be
                    assimilated has to be terminated.

                               WAYNE
                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
                    are not insane?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace
                    to living creatures, yes. But to
                    suggest that they're insane gives the
                    impression that they don't know right
                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know
                    the difference between right and wrong.
                    They just don't give a damn.

     INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

     Wayne's just finished viewing the show. He puts his hands on
     Scott and Roger's shoulders.

                               WAYNE
                    Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'-
                    tastic! I think that interview stuff's
                    too long, we can lose some of that.
                    Keep the girls, keep the long hairs,
                    keep the Hun brothers, keep the black
                    guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the
                    cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest.
                    And cut the interview with the prison
                    board fellow before that. Cut it after
                    I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was
                    a whole new team.' Don't even let him
                    answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me
                    talking about the two chicken shit
                    psychiatrists and straight in Dr.
                    Reinghold laughing.

                               SCOTT
                    Okay.

     Wayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie.

                               WAYNE
                    Children, we have a show.
                         (to Scott & Roger)
                    You two get some long well overdue
                    sleep. 'Cause tomorrow, bright and
                    early, county jail and then journey's
                    end...Mickey Knox.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey's pacing back and forth in his cell, trying out different
     jokes.

                               MICKEY
                    There's this Italian guy, a French guy,
                    and a Polish guy. And they're all
                    talkin' about how they fuck their
                    wives---

     JUMP CUT:

                               MICKEY
                    ...You know, I'm gonna just rip off
                    your dress and squeeze your titties.
                    Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out
                    her .357, sticks it in the Big Bad
                    Wolf's face and says, 'No you're not.
                    You're gonna eat me...just like the
                    story says.'

                               MICKEY
                         (with a lisp)
                    ...Fairy boat! I knew things were
                    good in here, but I didn't know we had
                    our own Navy.

                               MICKEY
                    ...So this guy wants to take little
                    Johnny's sister to the drive-in. But
                    the mother says, 'Only if you take
                    little Johnny along---'

     JUMP CUT:

                               MICKEY
                    ...And the Polish guy says, 'That's
                    nothing. When I get through with my
                    Hanna, I get up, wipe my dick on the
                    curtain, and she hits the roof!'

     Mickey's pretending he's calming down a hysterical audience.

                    too kind...no...please...

     INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY

     Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE -
     16mm.

     NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are
     filming handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise
     specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

     Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the
     back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front
     driving.

                               WAYNE
                         (with mouthful of donut)
                    How's it working, Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Perfecto!

     Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to
     him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

                               ROGER
                    Where the fuck's the chocolate cream
                    filled? Did anyone get my chocolate
                    cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

     CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

                               ROGER
                    I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.
                    You saw me do it, didn't you?

     Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    You were there. Did you see him put it
                    in a box?

     We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

                               ROGER
                    At the time, I was too busy explaining
                    to Scott the finer points of film.

     We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Yeah, right. You know what he said?
                    He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple
                    Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

     Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

                               WAYNE
                         (to Roger)
                    You can't be serious?

                               ROGER
                         (preoccupied)
                    I'm as serious about that as I am about
                    going back to the donut store, and
                    dipping that stupid Mexican's head into
                    the batter for forgetting my chocolate
                    cream filled. Gimme that other box.

                               WAYNE
                    Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

                               ROGER
                    That dumbass probably put my chocolate
                    cream filled in there by mistake.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, no.

                               ROGER
                    What's the big deal? Take out my
                    chocolate cream filled, put one of
                    these roasted coconut---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, do you understand what the word
                    'no' means? It's important we
                    establish a rapport. Something as
                    simple as a dozen donuts can mean the
                    world to somebody who hasn't had a
                    donut in a year.

                               ROGER
                    So you're giving a man who butchers
                    whole families, little babies included,
                    my chocolate cream filled?

     Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the
     windshield.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County
                    Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

                               ROGER
                    Wayne---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.
                    Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and
                    gather your gear.

     The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent
     Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

                               WAYNE
                         (aside to Scott)
                    Here's the welcome wagon.

     Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

                               WURLITZER
                    Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.
                    We talked on the phone. It's a
                    pleasure to meet you.

                               WAYNE
                    Same here. Let me introduce my crew.
                    Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie
                    ...this is...I'm sorry. What's
                    your title again?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm the superintendent here at L.A.
                    County Jail. Me and my deputies are
                    who you'll be working with while you're
                    here.

                               WAYNE
                    That sounds great. Look, I don't want
                    any of this to intimidate you. This is
                    not going to be a big deal. This is
                    going to be very easy.
                         (to his crew)
                    I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You
                    guys get your equipment ready, power up
                    the van and confirm a transmission code
                    for the remote. Julie come with me.

     Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks
     confidentially to Wurlitzer.

                               WAYNE
                    The main thing I need is a big room,
                    shut off from the population, so we can
                    get some privacy...with a few
                    electrical outlets.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from
     the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect
     for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS
     around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his
     sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

     Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA
     moves from person to person without cutting.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to two Deputies)
                    This is just for an interview, I was
                    on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.
                    It was a much bigger deal than this.
                    They had a crew of maybe seventy-five
                    people.

     CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    We're gonna be talking over here. But
                    I want enough freedom so if I wanna get
                    up and move around, we can.

     Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

                               WAYNE
                    Take him and walk him over this way.
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,
                    what the hell was that all about?
                         (pauses--to Scott)
                    Then maybe take him to the window.

     He walks Scott to the window.

                               WAYNE
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail
                    today, what's the first thing you'd do?
                         (pause--to Scott)
                    Little shit like that. I don't wanna
                    have to feel I gotta stay in the
                    chairs. We're after a cinema verite,
                    anything can happen, truth twenty-four
                    times a second kindda feel.

     End of single SHOT.

     Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    And when it's lunch time, they don't
                    just go to McDonalds. They got cooks
                    there servin' great food. Swedish
                    meatballs...

     Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

                               WAYNE
                    Everything's coming along just fine.
                    Phil, I wanted to know if I could have
                    a small word with you.

                               WURLITZER
                    By all means.

     Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around
     the room.

                               WAYNE
                    You met the kids I have working for me?
                    Great bunch, aren't they?

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

                               WAYNE
                    Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,
                    magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I
                    could sooner do without my arm than
                    Unruly Julie.

                               WURLITZER
                    Is that her real name?

                               WAYNE
                    Just a little nickname. Yep, they're
                    my kids and they're all I need. After
                    working together these past coupla
                    years, we're like well-oiled machinery.
                    No, more like a Formula race car. No,
                    scratch that one, too. What we're
                    really like is a Swiss watch. Small,
                    intricate, compact...it shouldn't
                    work as well as it does, but it does.
                    Because of the craftsmanship, the
                    expertise, and the artist's loving
                    hand.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

                               WURLITZER
                    I see.

                               WAYNE
                    Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever
                    been on a set before---

                               WURLITZER
                         (proudly)
                    Ya know, I was.

                               WAYNE
                         (acting surprised)
                    Really?

                               WURLITZER
                    I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set
                    about eight years ago.

                               WAYNE
                         (still acting surprised)
                    Well...small world. Well, then, you
                    know firsthand how Hollywood does
                    things. Lights all over the place,
                    generators, a hundred and fifty crew
                    members---

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there
                    was probably ninety-five people there,
                    maybe more.

                               WAYNE
                    See what I mean? It's a funny
                    business, isn't it?

                               WURLITZER
                    It sure is.

                               WAYNE
                    They got a asshole over here.
                         (pointing to his left)
                    A asshole sitting down reading a
                    magazine over there.
                         (points to his right)
                    A asshole perched up there.
                         (points straight up)
                    Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we
                    were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang
                    stuff we'd need all those assholes,
                    too. What we're about is intimacy.
                    We're about two people having a
                    conversation. Say I was interviewing
                    you. All I want you to worry about is
                    what I ask you. I want a trust to
                    develop. If you're thinking about all
                    this...
                         (indicates the hustle and
                         bustle of a set)
                    ...you're not going to relax, a trust
                    won't develop, we'll be talking a each
                    other instead of to each other, there
                    will be no chance for intimacy.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

                               WAYNE
                    That's why my crew is only three...an
                    invisible three.
                         (switching gears)
                    Which brings me to what I wanted to
                    talk to you about. I have to get
                    Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to
                    share what he's never shared before...
                    Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till
                    today have been closed. Well, how can
                    we expect him to do that when we got
                    Los Angeles County Sheriffs up
                    the walls.

     Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                         (snorts)
                    Well, just what the hell do you expect
                    me to do?

                               WAYNE
                    Lose 'em.

                               WURLITZER
                    Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest
                    idea how dangerous Knox is?

                               WAYNE
                    Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very
                    familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

     They're out and out angry.

                               WURLITZER
                    Since he and his wife have been in
                    custody, they've killed---

                               WAYNE
                    Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure
                    I know 'em better than you do.

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, let me let you in on one more fact you
                    obviously don't know. If I were to
                    take my men away, Mickey Knox would
                    snap your neck like a twig.

                               WAYNE
                    One...I can take care of myself. I
                    grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and
                    I've handled some pretty rough
                    customers in my day. Mickey Knox
                    doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a
                    journalist, and I'm prepared to take
                    that risk. Three...it ain't gonna
                    happen. Believe me when I tell you, it
                    is in Mickey Knox's own best interest
                    to play this game according to Hoyle.
                         (pause)
                    Wait a minute. We've gotten into a
                    advisory relationship here, which is
                    not what I want.
                         (pause)
                    But seriously, Phil, look at this.

     Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.

                               WAYNE
                         (counting)
                    We got one...two...three...four
                    ...five...six...seven...eight.
                    I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too
                    much. Let's lose some of these guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne, if it was anybody else---

                               WAYNE
                    Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam
                    up on me with all these sheriffs all
                    over the place. They hate him. He
                    hates them. What kinda intimacy am I
                    gonna create with all this hate in the
                    air. Even you and I feel it.

                               WURLITZER
                    What are we talking about?

                               WAYNE
                    Two guys?

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay. I'll take two guys off.

                               WAYNE
                    No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two
                    guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    I can't do that. Five guys.

                               WAYNE
                    Three.

                               WURLITZER
                    I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but
                    that's it.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head.

     CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in
     the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open.
     The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and
     shackles.

                               DEPUTY #1
                    On your feet! Turn your face to the
                    wall.

     Mickey gets up.

                               MICKEY
                    Now what you're supposed to say is:
                    'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

     OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

     CU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell
     door makes her up with a jolt.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Rise and shine, Mallory!

     Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two
     deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and
     WASHINGTON.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and
     Washington's shiny black shoes.

     The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,
     along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,
     reverberates throughout the scene.

     Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding
     deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a
     cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long
                    and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

     Mallory looks straight ahead.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    See, I've been there twice. And I'm
                    not lookin' forward to goin' back. But
                    I'm in and out. You, on the other
                    hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the
                    rest of your life there. Now that's
                    what I call cruel and inhuman
                    punishment.

     Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Course you're not gonna give a shit.
                    'Cause when the good doctor's get
                    through givin' you the zap...
                         (he puts his finger next
                         to his temple, pantomimes
                         being electrocuted)
                    ...You won't know where the hell you
                    are. They'll just put you on a window
                    sill, and water you every other day.
                       
     Mallory lets out a big yawn.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly
     Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his
     entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally
     bursting into laughter.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    And when he gets here, its no dick'n
                    around time. Make him up, clip a mike
                    on him, then leave him alone. I don't
                    want you talking to him. I don't want
                    you getting in his face. I want you
                    hiding behind your gear. You are
                    invisible.

     CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the
     supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how
     he can still walk.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    Okay, break.

     Wayne's team disburses.

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

     Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others
     start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.

     Wayne approaches Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Wayne)
                    Okay now, before we get started here,
                    there's a few things we have to get
                    clear about.

                               WAYNE
                    All right, Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove
     the chains.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The
     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring
     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to
     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's
     wrists.

     Mallory's silent.

     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

                               BINGHAM
                    Turn around and face the wall!

     Mallory does.

     Bingham and Washington move to the door.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Wait outside for a second, fellas.

                               BINGHAM
                    We're not supposed---

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Don't worry about it.

     Bingham and Washington move outside.

     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before
     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back
     to him.

     Scagnetti walks up behind her.

     Mallory doesn't move.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Want a smoke?

     Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    C'mon, I already lit one for you. I
                    know you smoke.

     Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
     mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of
     Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I was reading the file on you. You
                    know what it said during your
                    trial, whenever they put you on the
                    stand, no matter what they asked, your
                    answer was always the same...'I love
                    Mickey.' It also says that when they
                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'
                    was the only thing you said that
                    registered as the truth.

     Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky
                    Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your
                    Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is
                    that the attraction? Or does he just
                    got a big dick?

     Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a
                    big donkey dick.

     Scagnetti presses closer.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is
                    close your eyes and remember...
                    remember the last time ol' Mickey gave
                    you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'
                    about it? Good. Remember it. Don't
                    ever forget it cause it ain't never
                    gonna happen again. Cause when they
                    get through with all that electroshock
                    shit they got lined up for you two,
                    Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

     Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.
     Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Look. You're gonna sit here for a
                    couple hours while I finish up the
                    arrangements. The reason they picked
                    me to be your chaperone is they know I
                    won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.
                     
     Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, during our journey, if any wild
                    hairs spring up on your ass, you'd
                    better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with
                    me, bitch, even a little bit, you're
                    gonna get accidentally shot!
                    Comprehende?

     Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD
     BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a
     horrible scream.

     EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell
     door.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti
     face down on the ground.

     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break
     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's
     screaming.

     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their
     shotguns.

     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,
     screaming.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    She broke my fucking nose! That bitch
                    broke my nose!

     Washington comes over to him and helps him up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (blood down his face)
                    She broke my nose.

                               WASHINGTON
                    I'll fix it.

     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.
     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down
     from the pain.

     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down
     from his face, looking over at Mallory.

     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun
     barrel placed in her mouth.

     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold her, boys.

     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun
     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on
     either side of her, holding her in place.

     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings
     it up to Mallory's face.

     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
     eyes, and all over her body.

     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on
     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They
     can't look at this anymore.

     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her
     all over her body.

     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the
     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can
     back to Washington.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I want this filled before we leave.

     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking
     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of
     excruciating pain.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a
     microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to
     Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    How come you never talk?

                               ROGER
                    She was born without a tongue.

                               MICKEY
                         (repulsed)
                    Oh my God!
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Sorry.

     Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and
     continues applying make-up.

     Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.

                               WAYNE
                    So we got a deal. Four deputies---

                               WURLITZER
                    And me.

                               WAYNE
                    Why don't we make it three deputies and
                    you?

                               WURLITZER
                    Why don't I have Mickey thrown back
                    into his cell and we can forget the
                    whole thing?

                               WAYNE
                    Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and
                    you, I can live with that. We're about
                    ready to go here, so let's get rid of
                    these other assholes.

                               WURLITZER
                    Don't call my men assholes.

                               WAYNE
                    I didn't mean they were assholes. I
                    mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta
                    here.

     Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up
     a light stand.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of
                    these assholes. Now I want to create
                    the illusion that this is just Mickey
                    and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.
                    So make sure you don't film these
                    assholes. I don't want to see 'em on
                    film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'
                    slated our spot as human interest which
                    means we'll go live at just after
                    five-thirty.

     Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G.

     Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    This asshole's tryin' to tell me what
                    I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!
                    This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's
                    dealin' with here, but we do. And if
                    shit happens, he ain't gonna be
                    responsible, we are. So keep your
                    shotguns out, your fingers on the
                    triggers, and be ready to fire at a
                    moment's notice.

     BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a
     donut. He takes a big bite.

                               ROGER
                    Say something.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    What?

                               ROGER
                    Anything.

     Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.

                               MICKEY
                         (talking in rhyme)
                    I stand amid the roar
                    Of a surf tormented shore,
                    As I hold within my hand
                    Grains of the golden sand--
                    How few! yet how they creep
                    Through my fingers to the deep,
                    While I weep--while I weep!
                    O God! can I not save
                    One from the pitiless wave?
                    Is all that we see or seem
                    But a dream within a dream?

     Mickey bites into the donut.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    How was that?

     Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.

                               ROGER
                    Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment
                    here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n
                    roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the
                    donut place put a chocolate cream
                    filled I asked for in your box.

                               MICKEY
                    There's a chocolate cream filled in
                    there?

                               ROGER
                    Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

                               MICKEY
                    Tough titty, it's mine now.

                               ROGER
                    Look, I'll trade you.

     Wayne enters frame.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!
                    What did I tell you. Stop bothering
                    Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

                               ROGER
                         (to himself)
                    Fine. Roger, what the hell are you
                    doing? You're bothering the serial
                    killer.

     Roger exits FRAME.

     Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Sorry about that.

                               MICKEY
                    Don't worry about it.

                               WAYNE
                    We're about ready to go here. Are you
                    ready?

                               MICKEY
                    Let's do it.

     Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay people! Let's start to settle
                    down here.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16mm - BLACK & WHITE

     SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of
     Mickey's eye.

     CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Are you comfortable?

     Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Roger?

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Rockin'!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Rollin'...and speed!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Slate it.

     CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into
     view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the
     FRAME.

                               WAYNE
                    So, Mickey, tell us what you do for
                    fun.

                               MICKEY
                    Aside from the obvious?

     Mickey breaks out laughing.

                               WAYNE
                         (not amused)
                    Yes. Aside from the obvious.

    Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, let me see now. What do I do for
                    fun?
                         (to people O.S.)
                    Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are
                    drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.
                         (to camera)
                    Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just
                    sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies
                    smokin' up a storm, and it's really
                    doin' it to me.

     A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights
     it. Deputy exits FRAME.

                               MICKEY
                    Much obliged. What do I do for fun?
                    Do you want to know what I do for fun
                    or what I did for fun?

                               WAYNE
                    What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun
                    for starters.

                               MICKEY
                    What I did for fun for starters.
                         (thinking)
                    Well, something I used to do...always
                    was a lot of fun...
                         (pause)
                    No, scratch that. Let me think of
                    something else. In fact, why don't we
                    come back to that question. Ask me
                    something else.

                               WAYNE
                    Do you miss Mallory?

                               MICKEY
                    Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my
                    wife. I haven't seen her in a long
                    time. What a stupid question.

                               WAYNE
                    Then was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was what worth it?

                               WAYNE
                    Was massacring all those people worth
                    being separated from your wife for the
                    rest of your life?

     Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you think up these questions or the
                    girl with no tongue?

                               WAYNE
                    No, Mickey, I can't let you get away
                    with that shit. Answer the question.
                    Was it worth it? You haven't seen,
                    heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.
                    Was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was an instant of purity worth a
                    lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

                               WAYNE
                    Excuse me, did you say an instant of
                    purity? What was the instant of
                    purity? The bodies you left behind on
                    your bloody trail?

                               MICKEY
                    That's only part of it. I mean, it's a
                    big, big, big part. But it's only the
                    chorus, it's not the whole song.

                               WAYNE
                         (passionately)
                    Please explain to me, Mickey, where's
                    the purity that you couldn't live
                    without in five year old Danny
                    Millhouse's blown off head? Where's
                    the purity in forty-eight people who
                    are no longer on this planet because
                    they met you and Mallory? What's so
                    fucking pure about that?

     CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes
     a slow drag off his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Where the purity comes into play---

     The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams.

     WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that
                    thought. Reload, quick!

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     We're back to COLOR 35mm.

     WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell.
     CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her
     face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to
     subside.

     All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Love is a hurtin' thang,
                    and it leaves a fiery sting.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Okay. Okay, we're up again.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Roll it. Save the slate.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16MM - BLACK & WHITE

     We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of
     film.

                               WAYNE
                    You just said an instant of purity was
                    preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't
                    understand. What's so pure about
                    forty-eight dead bodies?

                               MICKEY
                    You'll never understand. Me and you,
                    Wayne, we're not even the same species.
                    I used to be you...then I evolved.
                    From where you're standing, you're a
                    man. From where I'm standing, you're a
                    ape. I'm here...I'm right here...
                    and you...you're somewhere else, man.
                    You say why? I say why not?

                               WAYNE
                    Tell me about the purity.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughing)
                    It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and
                    a smoke only get you so far. You're
                    gonna have to do your job.

                               WAYNE
                         (laughs)
                    Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll
                    move on and come back later.

                               MICKEY
                    I'm sure we will.

                               WAYNE
                    Describe Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                    Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,
                    she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two
                    feet, two hands, ten fingers...

                               WAYNE
                    Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You
                    know what I mean. Describe Mallory.
                         (points at his head)
                    What's up here?
                         (points at his heart)
                    What's in here?

                               MICKEY
                    That's indescribable.

                               WAYNE
                    Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do
                    you feel about the fact that you're
                    never gonna see Mallory again?

                               MICKEY
                         (smiles)
                    Says who?

                               WAYNE
                    Says the United States of America.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughs)
                    When have they ever been right?

     The crew laughs (O.S.)

                               MICKEY
                    Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.
     His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.
     Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to
     Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't
     believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

                               MICKEY
                    ...one night I was asleep, and a noise
                    wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,
                    somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a
                    gun, so I go into the living room with
                    a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned
                    out to be nothing. God made the noise.
                    Who knows?

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (whispers)
                    How's it goin'?

                               WURLITZER
                         (whispers)
                    Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

     Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.

                               WURLITZER
                    What the hell happened to you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You should see the other bitch. What
                    time you got?

                               WURLITZER
                    Two-thirty. Shhh...

     CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of
     the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to
     Mickey's story.

                               MICKEY
                    But I came to the direction I need a
                    gun. Do, the next day I started off
                    early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a
                    gun shop and pick up a little home
                    protection. I walked into the place
                    and had never seen so many guns in all
                    my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the
                    this really nice sales guy comes up to
                    me. His name was Warren. I'll never
                    forget his name. He was really nice.
                    Anyway, Warren showed me all these
                    different models of guns. Magnums,
                    automatics, pistols, Walters. And I
                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a
                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon
                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew
                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.
                    It felt like it was a part of me. They
                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at
                    myself holding it, and looked so
                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.
                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
                    Turned my car around, drove to
                    Mallory's house, we took care of
                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,
                    and we were off.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     MEDIUM CU on Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The
                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,
                    they all missed the point of the story.
                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding
                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I
                    realized for the first time my one true
                    calling in life. I'm a natural born
                    killer.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, let's cut it.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

                               WAYNE
                         (to Scott)
                    Did ya get that?

     Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.

                               SCOTT
                    It's gonna be beautiful.

                               WAYNE
                    Super cool.
                         (to Mickey)
                    This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

                               MICKEY
                    I could go for a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm not running out and getting that
                    piece of shit a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                    Fine.
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Julie, why don't you make a food run?
                         (to the room)
                    What's around here?

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    There's an In and Out Burgers about a
                    block away on Olive. It's walking
                    distance.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.
                    I'll have a double double with cheese,
                    french fries, and a large Coke.

     Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then
     goes from person to person collecting their orders.

     Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

                               WURLITZER
                    Are you all set?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready
                    to roll.

                               WURLITZER
                    I assigned you Bingham and Washington
                    to go along.

     In B.G., Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah, we met. They're good men.

                               WURLITZER
                    They're real Goddamn good. They'll be
                    there for when ya need 'em. Where
                    are they?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Waitin' in the lounge.

                               WURLITZER
                    How 'bout Mallory?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

     Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In
     the B.G., we hear the wall phone BUZZ.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

                               WURLITZER
                    Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

     Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    Capt'n!

                               WURLITZER
                    Yeah?

     The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    They need you. Emergency!

     Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into phone)
                    Talk to me.
                         (pause)
                    Where?
                         (pause)
                    For the love of Pete...okay...okay
                    ...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on
                    my way.

     CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious
     eavesdroppers.

     CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,
     Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's
     conversation.

     OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a
                    riot going on in the laundry room.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Is it serious?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    It sure as hell is. They got guns,
                    hostages, and explosives.

     The room reacts.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Jack, could you stay up here for a
                    while?

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Yeah, sure.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'm taking one of these men. Yates,
                    come with me.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Could we go with you and film it?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Stay up here and finish your interview,
                    I've got to see what the hell's going
                    on down there before I can take
                    responsibility for you to film there.

     We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.

     Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her
     notebook.

                               MICKEY
                    I'll have a four by four. That's four
                    patty burgers. Now they don't have
                    that on the menu, but if you order a
                    four by four, they'll know what you're
                    talking about. A large Coke and two
                    orders of fries.

     When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off
     silently.

     CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

     As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the
     CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the
     DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall
     masques with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds
     of a riot swell until...

     A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a
     MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

     The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before
     moving on.

     CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling
     across the floor.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Sure.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty
                    funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now
                    in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.
                    And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks
                    her mother if she can go out on a date.

     As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's
     CAMERA follows.

                               MICKEY
                    The mother asks, 'Where's he taking
                    you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in
                    movie.' The mother tells her she can
                    only go if she takes Little Johnny with
                    her. She says okay. They go to the
                    drive-in, they come back. The mother
                    gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,
                    what happened? Where did ya go?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
     like he's driving.

                               MICKEY
                    Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What
                    did they do?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

                               MICKEY
                    'They kissed. What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.

                               MICKEY
                    'He felt her up? What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

                               MICKEY
                         (dumbfounded)
                    'They took off their clothes? What
                    else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.

                               MICKEY
                    'They did it? What were you doing?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking
     off.

     Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,
     even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

     As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4
     during the punchline.

     While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy
     #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from
     Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with
     the butt.

     Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

     Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     The other deputies react.

     Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in
     the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with
     a THUD.

     Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching
     position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

     Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

     The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him
     out of FRAME.

     Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --
     SLOW MOTION.

     CU of ceiling being BLASTED.

     Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.

     Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to
     fire -- SLOW MOTION.

     Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti --
     SLOW MOTION.

     Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.

     Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

     They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of
     the room.

     Nobody fires.

     We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on
     the ground, scared to death.

     CU on Scagnetti's face.

     CU on Mickey's face.

     CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then
     CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

     OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into
     a CU on his face.

                               MICKEY
                    Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Slide the shotgun over here, put your
                    hands behind your head, put your
                    forehead on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow
                    you in half and you know it.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I've never wounded anything in my life.
                    I got you locked right between the eyes.

     Mickey rises.

                               MICKEY
                    If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'
                    you in half on three. So, if you got
                    me locked, take the shot. One...

     DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in F.G., past the gun, to his face.

     CU of barrel of shotgun.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Two...

     DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.

     Wayne watches, wide eyed.

     ECU on Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                    Three!

     MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold it! Don't shoot!

     He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up.

                               MICKEY
                    Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

     Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.

     The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet -- SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Toss it.

     Scagnetti does.

                               MICKEY
                    Now put your hands behind your head.

     Scagnetti does.

     Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand,
     facing each other.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What?

     Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti
     hits the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.

     Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys stay on your bellies.

                               ROGER
                    Yes, sir.

     Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.

                               MICKEY
                    I am the most dangerous man in the
                    world.

     Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.

     Scagnetti screams.

     Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY
                         (points at Scagnetti)
                    You're the law.
                         (points at himself)
                    I'm the law breaker.

     Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.

     Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.

                               MICKEY
                    Donut, get your camera. See if it's
                    broke.

                               WAYNE
                    Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

                               MICKEY
                    Scott's dead. And unless you wanna
                    play follow the leader, shut up and do
                    as you're told.


     Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds
     like a lawn mower.

                               MICKEY
                    How is it?

                               ROGER
                    Not good.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you have a back up.

                               ROGER
                    It's video.

                               MICKEY
                    Even better. Wayne call your station,
                    tell 'em we're going live a little
                    early today. Make it happen!

                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a
     TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only
     see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the
     FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us.

                               WURLITZER
                    I want two men stationed in that tier,
                    and I want men with rifles all along

                    Capt'n!

     Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the layout of the laundry room.

                               WURLITZER
                    Where do the air ducts lead?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Problem is they'll hear somebody
                    approaching that way.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    We turned off the power when they took
                    over the room.

                               WURLITZER
                    We turn it back on. The machines go
                    back on supplying us with the cover
                    noise we need. Smithy, do it.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Right away, Capt'n.

     CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    Yes.

                               WURLITZER
                    You sure?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    I think--

                               WURLITZER
                    Never say you think when you know, or
                    you know when you think.

     Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)

                         (from walkie talkie)
                    Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Pass this to your team...the second
                    they get a lock on a blue, they're to
                    take the shot. Do you understand?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks to his right.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you think, Pitney? How much
                    Explosives do you think that they
                    really have in there?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    It's hard to say Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Take a wild stab!

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

                               WURLITZER
                    The entire wing?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    That's my opinion.

                    been written.

     Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.

                               MICKEY
                    Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie
                    just underwent a title change. It's
                    now called 'The Escape of Mickey and

                    Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have
                    just tuned in, it appears that a
                    hostage situation involving Mickey Knox
                    is developing presently at the Los
                    Angeles County Jail. We have seen that
                    he is armed and apparently there has
                    been some loss of life. We will try to
                    re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle
                    and bring you more on this late
                    breaking story. Please stay tuned.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

     WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and
     grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go
     of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it
     loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off
     the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

     Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and
     slips it into his pants.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.
                    Stand behind me, put your back against
                    mine and extend your arms behind you.

     Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against
     Mickey's.

                               MICKEY
                    Now if I feel your back move away from
                    mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
                    Got it?

     Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Wayne, step forward.

     Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus
                    against the barrel.

     Wayne does.

                               MICKEY
                    Grab his arms.

     Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with
     gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

                               MICKEY
                    Either one of you two move, it's gonna
                    be shotgun city. You understand?

                               WAYNE & SCAGNETTI
                    Yes.

     Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

                               MICKEY
                    You ready, Donut?

                               ROGER
                    Ready.

                               MICKEY
                    Wagons, hooaaa!

     The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with
     the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's
     walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to
     his neck.

     Roger follows with the camera.

     The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey,
     Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up
     along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped
     with tape.

     CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.

                    Honey, I'm home.

     Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This
     kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something
     everybody told them they would never do again.

     For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're
     enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.

     fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is

     As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,

                               MICKEY
                    Let me have the keys.

     Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses
     the keys to Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

                               MICKEY
                    No.

                               WAYNE
                    This is crazy. You can't escape like
                    this.

                               MICKEY
                    Probably not, but we're gonna give it
                    the old college try.

                               WAYNE
                    We'll all be killed.

                               MALLORY
                    Exciting, isn't it?

     Duncan begins to cry.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, when we get out there, you do what
                    we say or it's curtains. If we say
                    move, you move. If we say left, you
                    move left. If we say right, you move
                    right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.
                    Got it?

                               MALLORY
                    Are we in a big hurry?

                               MICKEY
                    You got something you want to do?

                               MALLORY
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    By all means, knock yourself out.

                               MALLORY
                    Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

     Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

     VIDEO FOOTAGE:

     Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she
     points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

                               MALLORY
                    You! Stand up!

     Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the
     wrong woman.

     Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

                               MALLORY
                    You probably thought it was pretty
                    funny, didn't ya?

     She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.
     Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

                               MALLORY
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked with me? Close your eyes and
                    remember...Are ya thinking about it?
                    Good.

     Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

     Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger
     HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

                               DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

                               MICKEY
                    We're sending out a hostage. Don't
                    touch him!

     OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

     Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory
     jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using
     the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell
     and...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

     There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

     CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the
     caravan.

     The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,
     real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

     The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,
     and gunfire.

     HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

     The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

     Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees
     this and screams.

                               MALLORY
                    Mickey!

                               MICKEY
                    Don't stop!

     Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Man, oh, man...this is better than
                    Vietnam!

     More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

     Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using
     DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.
     Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

                               DUNCAN
                    Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.
     The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

     Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
     control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

     CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls
     into FRAME screaming.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Get the camera! Get the fucking
                    camera!

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from
     Roger's side.

     The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last
     hostage.

     Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
     and silent.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    This way.

     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan
     the remaining hostage deputy.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Duncan)
                    Where does this lead?

     Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to
     wall.

                               MICKEY
                    Where!?!

                               DUNCAN
                    Th-- the ground floor.

                               MALLORY
                    Is that the front door?

     Duncan nods frantically.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's go.

     Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the
     stairs. They go down a few flights.

     As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team
     of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies
     raise their guns.

     Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand
     pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other
     are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

                               MALLORY
                    Back off or I'll blast him! Back off
                    or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll
                    blast him!

     None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
     likely to start shooting.

     Wayne screams.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!
                    Please, please, please...

     Wayne continues begging.

     Wurlitzer steps forward.

                               WURLITZER
                    Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

                               MALLORY
                    Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna
                    hear it!

                               WURLITZER
                    You have to know---

                               MALLORY
                    I said shut up...

     Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him
     in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

     Wayne's screaming in pain.

     The deputies jump back.

                               MALLORY
                    ...and I mean shut up!

     There's a bit of a silent standoff.

     Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly
     retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

     The deputies hold their present position.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory
     let their two hostages sit down.

     Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his
     uniform.

     Mickey's pacing.

                               MICKEY
                    Think...think...think...

     Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her
     hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's
     been shot.

     Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling
     from below.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Give up! There's no other way out!

     Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.
     him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

                               MALLORY
                    Look, lover boy, we're not getting
                    outta here. So I say the hell with
                    going back to our cells. Let's do a
                    Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
                    Run down these stairs shootin', go out
                    in a hail of bullets, but take as many
                    of those motherfuckers with us as
                    possible.

     Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

                               MICKEY
                    We'll do that when all else fails.

     Mickey stands.

                               MALLORY
                    Hasn't it?

                               MICKEY
                    We still got a few tricks up our
                    sleeves.

     Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You married?

                               DUNCAN
                    Oh, I don't wanna die...

                               MICKEY
                    Are you married? Do you have kids?

     Duncan nods pathetically.

                               MICKEY
                    Good. People, we're goin' all the way
                    to the front door. Now, the only way
                    we're gonna get there is if they don't
                    want to kill you two more than they
                    want to kill us.

     INSERT:

     SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill
     Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Right now I find that highly unlikely.
                    So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

     BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:

     Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, say I tell those guys down there
                    if they shoot or make a move, I'm
                    killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or
                    make a move anyway. Now say by some
                    freak accident, you didn't die, you
                    live though it. What would you do?

     Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts
     tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    What would I do? Me and my network
                    would sue the entire Los Angeles County
                    Sheriffs Department for flagrantly
                    disregarding my safety. I'd go
                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and
                    make sure everyone of those son of a
                    bitches down there ends up on the
                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue
                    every man down there personally. I
                    would make it my life's ambition to
                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.
                    I would do expose after expose on the
                    brutality, and the conditions, and the
                    inhumanity that exists here.

     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.
     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
     around the barrel of his shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    That's what I thought. You tell them
                    that. When we go down those stairs, I
                    want you to scream what you just told
                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the
                    star of American Maniacs watched every
                    week by'-- how many people?

                               WAYNE
                    On average forty million.

                               MICKEY
                    'Every week by forty million people. I
                    am a respected journalist.' Have you
                    won any awards?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The
                    Edward R. Murrow award...

                               MICKEY
                    'Respected journalist'-- On your
                    knees...

     Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props
     his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the
     barrel around his neck.

                               MICKEY
                         (continues)
                    ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the
                    Edward R. Murrow award among others.'
                    Tell 'em the name of your personal
                    lawyer, his firm, his address, and
                    phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor
                    and the unemployment lines. You
                    getting the idea?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

     Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the
     stock of the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Say it. Scream it. All the way out
                    the front door and into your van. And
                    if you stop screaming, I swear to God
                    I'll blow your head off.

                               WAYNE
                    Got it.

     Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before
     shouting to Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You! What's your name?

     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory
     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before
     reading his name badge.

                               MALLORY
                    Duncan...Homolka?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

     Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when
     they hear:

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Start.

     Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

     The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they
     take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would
     die.

     Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
     shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in
     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he
     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE
     and COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA
     on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be
     spared.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star
                    of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty
                    million people every week! I am a
                    respected journalist, winners of the
                    Golden Globe, the Edward R.
                    Murrows Award among others! If anybody
                    puts me in danger, my network will sue
                    The Los Angeles County Sheriffs
                    Department. My estate will sue every
                    officer personally who fires. The
                    network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis
                    and Sinclair...

     Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the
     deputies.

                               MALLORY
                         (yelling)
                    Make a path!

     The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

     The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne
     yelling all the way.

     The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they
     keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front
     lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

     Wurlitzer stands his ground.

                               WURLITZER
                    How far do you think your gonna get?

                               MICKEY
                    Right out the front door.

                               WURLITZER
                    That'll never happen.

                               MICKEY
                    It is happening.

     The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep
     their weapons ready.

     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

                               MALLORY
                    Don't stop!

     Wayne starts up again.

     The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer
     are nose to nose.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Mickey)
                    I will personally hunt you down, blow
                    the head off your fucking-whore-wife,
                    and plant your sick ass in the ground
                    all by myself.

                               MICKEY
                         (calmly)
                    Another day perhaps, but not today.

     Mickey leaves FRAME.

                                                    CUT TO:

     EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,
     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open
     air.

     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while
     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE
     LEADER.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &
     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being
     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a
     fence post.

     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not
     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly
     into the CAMERA.

                               WAYNE
                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and
                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are
                    shooting with a wild camera and a
                    standard recorder we found in the van.
                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked
                    out the front door, into my news van
                    and made our getaway. When we were
                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox
                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
                    and tossed his body out of the back.
                    Mickey told authorities over my police
                    band that I would surely be next if
                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They
                    took Mickey at his word and called off
                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
                    employed, I don't know. My only
                    thought is it all happened too fast for
                    arrangements to be made. We've just
                    pulled off to the side of the road to
                    do this interview. Tensions run high--

     Mickey screams O.S.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!

                               WAYNE
                    Without any further ado, Mickey and
                    Mallory...

     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting
     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces
     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's
                    plan? Did you think it would work?

                               MALLORY
                    It wasn't 'till we got on the ground
                    floor that I totally realized they
                    weren't gonna shoot unless we shot
                    first. When we got out of the
                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my
                    God. This might work.' But
                    Mickey knew it would work all along.
                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.
                    It's not like there was and he just
                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    What did you think then?

                               MALLORY
                    I wondered how long it would be before
                    we'd get to be alone together. And I
                    wondered if I could wait that long.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you have anything to do with the
                    riot in the laundry room?

                               MALLORY
                    Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'
                    word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can
                    I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Try to keep it to a minimum.

                               MALLORY
                    We had nothing to do with that riot.
                    That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

     Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

                              MICKEY
                    Divine intervention.

                               MALLORY
                    What he said. We didn't know jack shit
                    about and riot. It just happened. It
                    was kismet. We didn't even know those
                    people. How are we supposed to
                    organize a riot when we've been in
                    fuckin' isolation for the past year?
                    Just bleep out the fucks and jack
                    shits.
                         (laughs)
                    I mean, it's not like we care. If they
                    wanna say we masterminded the whole
                    thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep
                    us up at night. But you said you
                    wanted the truth, and the truth is we
                    were just lucky.

     Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

                               MICKEY
                    C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    So, what now?

                               MALLORY
                    Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take
                    it easy. Just enjoy each other's
                    company, stop and smell the roses,
                    notice the color purple, stuff like
                    that.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    How do you intend to disappear? you're
                    probably the most famous couple in
                    America.

                               MALLORY
                    Well, back in slave times they had a
                    thing called the underground railroad.
                    And we got a whole fan club out there
                    just waiting to be conductors.
                         (to the camera)
                    So, you kids out there, keep the faith.
                    Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'
                    to your town real soon.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, that's enough. End of interview.
                    We gotta move.

     Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
     lowers it from his eye.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay, just let me swing around and film
                    myself asking the questions. And then
                    I'll do my little wrap up.

     Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
     balances it on a fence post.

                               MICKEY
                    Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,
                    all right. But it won't be you starin'
                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting
                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be
                    starin' down the barrels of our
                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the
                    triggers.

     Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into
     a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    That's a joke right?

     Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her
     shotgun from off the ground.

                               WAYNE
                    Just wait one fucking minute.

                               MICKEY
                    I said I'd give you a interview. Now
                    unless I'm mistaken, we just did a
                    interview.
                         (to Mallory)
                    We did an interview, didn't we?

                               MALLORY
                    Looked like an interview to me.

                               MICKEY
                    I said we'd give you an interview. I
                    never said we wouldn't kill you.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt
                    during this...this whole escape that
                    a kind of bond--

     Wayne is shaking.

                               WAYNE
                         (continues)
                    ...developed between the three of
                    us. We're kindda in this together,
                    don't ya think?

                               MICKEY
                    No. Not really.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't touch those triggers! Please. I
                    think I've already proven that a live
                    Wayne Gayle is much more better that a
                    dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your
                    passport out of jail, not Duncan
                    Homolka. But me! I'll be your
                    passport outta---

                               MICKEY
                    Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate
                    you. If anybody in the fuckin' world
                    deserves to die, it's you.

     Wayne is grasping for anything.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and
                    Mallory always leave somebody alive to
                    tell the tale.

                               MICKEY
                    We are.
                         (points to camera)
                    Your camera.

     Mickey turns to Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                         (John Wayne voice)
                    Let's make a little music, Colorada.

                               WAYNE
                    NO!!!

     The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,
     who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

     Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing
     into the news van, they drive away.

     Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA
     eventually runs out of film.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back
     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We
     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF
     SCREEN.

     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

                               MICKEY
                    What kind of pies do you have?

                               MABEL
                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

                               MICKEY
                    Which do you recommend?

                               MABEL
                    The key lime is great, but it's
                    an acquired taste.

                               MICKEY
                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten
                    years.

                               MABEL
                    When ya had it, did ya like it?

                               MICKEY
                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a
                    completely different person ten years
                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in
                    court. And a large glass of milk.

     Mabel turns to her right.
 
                               MABEL
                         (to someone O.S.)
                    Should I make that two pieces?

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back
     is to the camera as well.

                               MALLORY
                    Nada, Rosey.

                               MABEL
                         (annoyed)
                    My name's not Rosey.
                         (points at name tag)
                    It's Mabel.

     Mabel exits FRAME.

                               MALLORY
                    Whatever.

     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next
     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,
     she selects a quarter.

                               MABEL
                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're
                    doin'?

     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes
     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
     shop.

     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

                               MABEL
                         (to Mickey)
                    She ought not be doing that. That's
                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time
     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

                               MICKEY
                    I can't take her anywhere.

     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
     hell these people are.

     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his
     pie and milk.

     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls
     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three
     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the
     pickup's hood.

                               EARL
                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.
                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er
                    out.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of
     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

                               SONNY
                    Good God almighty. What the hell is
                    that?

                               OTIS
                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.

     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

                               SONNY
                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next
     to Mickey.

                               SONNY
                    Miller, Mabel.

                               MABEL
                    Comin' up.

     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
     him.

     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a
     swig, enjoying the floor show.

                               SONNY
                         (to Mickey)
                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't
                    it?

     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression
     betrays nothing.

                               MICKEY
                    Her name's Mallory.

     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

                               OTIS
                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.
                    I'm just getting warmed up.

     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
     Sonny.

     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

                               SONNY
                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
     spinning him around.

     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the
     table, cracking the linoleum.

     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches
     hold of his shoulder.

     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points
     his finger at him, threateningly.

     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.
     Blood flows from the wound.

                               MICKEY
                    Just because my woman's mopping up the
                    floor with your buddy is no reason for
                    you to join in.

     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck
     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be
     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices
     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,
     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
     his jacket and FIRES.

     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It
     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
     the ground, screaming.

     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass
     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the
     ground dead.

     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING
     his head repeatedly on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Honey.

     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to
     Mickey's side.

     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
     pot, crying.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Pick one.

     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

                               MALLORY
                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a
                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let
                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My
                    mom told me to pick the best one and
                    you are it.

     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

                               MABEL
                    NO!

     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She
     hits the floor dead.

     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

                               MALLORY
                    When you tell people what went on here,
                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did
                    this. Understand?

     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.
     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

     Mickey and Mallory in a flashy '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.
     Duane Eddy's 'REBEL ROUSER' blares on the soundtrack. The B.G.
     is an outrageous PROCESS SHOT. The titles splash over this
     image 50's style.

     When this sequence is over, we CUT TO BLACK.

     END CREDIT SEQUENCE

     Over black screen, we hear:

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI
                    Send Scagnetti in here.

     INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY

     CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in
     the middle of the frame.

     JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's
     office. Squeri's never seen.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room
                    C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the
                    prison board, is waiting to meet you.
                    You're gonna deliver two prisoners from
                    the county jail to Nystrom Insane
                    Asylum in Bakersfield.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    This is bullshit. I'm a detective.
                    You want an errand boy, call Jerry
                    Lewis.

     Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door
     shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Jack!

     INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

     Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,
     wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

     PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already
     tied tie over his head.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY

     DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,
     stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.
     In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

     McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,
                    Scagnetti. You put an end to a
                    nightmare. The ladies of this city can
                    get to sleep again, and they have you
                    to thank.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thank you, sir.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Dewight McClusky of the California
                    Prison Board. Take a seat please.

     Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation
     table.

                               MCCLUSKY
                         (referring to book)
                    This is damn good reading. I'm
                    surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.
                    This would make a better movie than
                    that 'Serpico' shit.

     McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The
     Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.
     McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He
     lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    I think you'll find that good reading
                    as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.
                    You familiar with them?

     Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs
     of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who isn't?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You been followin' the news coverage?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've been separated since their
                    incarceration in a couple of
                    penitentiaries---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Susanville, Soledade.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've killed a shitload of inmates
                    and guards---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Five inmates, eight guards and one
                    psychiatrist all in one year's time...
                    Very good. You do keep up with the
                    headlines.

     Scagnetti nods.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Look, our situation in a nutshell is,
                    no prison wants 'em, no prison will
                    take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,
                    where the warden's as hard as a bar of
                    iron. No one wants those fuckin'
                    assholes behind their walls, dealin'
                    with 'em day in, day out.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I can appreciate that.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    So can we. So the solution to our
                    little problem is we had them deemed
                    crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to
                    Nystrom Asylum for the criminally
                    insane.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Lobotomy Bay?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You've heard of it?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, how do I fit into this scheme?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The public loves you Jack...You don't
                    mind if I call you Jack, do you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    By all means.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six
                    years on the force, a best-seller out on
                    paperback...

     McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent
                    lawman with a deadly axe to grind with
                    maniacs.

     McClusky lowers the book.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a breathing icon of justice and
                    that's why you were chosen to deliver
                    Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison
                    board we, knows that once you get them
                    on the road if anything should happen,
                    an escape attempt, an accident, fire,
                    anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti
                    would be there to look out for his
                    public's best interests.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I see.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You write the script Jack, call it,
                    'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination
                    of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...
                    Have we found our man?

     Hold on Scagnetti.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY

     SCAGNETTI'S POV: McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He
     BANGS on it with is fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through
     this scene.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through
                    with a visitor!

     A BUZZER SOUNDS

     McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As
     soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the
     song 'Long Time Woman'.

     McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my
                    years with the penal institution, and
                    I'll tell ya that's no small number,
                    Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a
                    doubt the most twisted, depraved group
                    of fucks it's ever been my displeasure
                    to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two
                    rat shits are a walkin' reminder of
                    just how fucked up our system really
                    is.

     The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed.

                    Mickey's better half herself. Mallory
                    Knox. This little lady drowned her
                    father in a fish tank.

     CU of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly
     Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

                    While the two together burned her
                    mother alive in her bed.

     INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MEDIUM CU of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open.
     What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME,
     pouring gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags.
     CAMERA PANS up and we see Mickey holding a gas can.

     CU of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in
     front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV:

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Why?

     McClusky's still walking ahead of us.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Because they wouldn't give them their
                    blessing for marriage.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Ain't love grand.

     McClusky laughs.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's
     file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color
     of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that
     is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

     As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

                               FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)
                    When pressed about the reason for the
                    murders...patient became hostile...

     INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine
     dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly
     at the CAMERA.

                               MALLORY
                    I don't owe you an explanation! I don't
                    owe you shit! I'm not here for your
                    entertainment. If I don't tell you
                    what you wanna hear, what are you gonna
                    do? Throw me in jail? I'm already
                    there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna
                    give me some more time? I've already
                    got life. What else you got to
                    threaten me with? Death? I'd like to
                    see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one
                    motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

     BACK TO DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:

     Still on SCAGNETTI'S POV:

     We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a
     cell door.

     We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell.

     We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures
     toward the cell.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Here she is...you know her, you
                    love her, you can't live without
                    her...Mallory Knox.

     We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see
     Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing.

     INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY

     CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    99 years is a long, long time. Look at
                    me, I will never be free, I'm a long time
                    woman...

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to
                    meet you.

     Mallory just keeps on truckin'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Been workin' on the road now.
                    Been workin' by the sea.
                    Been workin' in the cane fields.
                    and I wanna be free...

     MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second.
     Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory
     screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV
     flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

     MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

     CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jesus Christ!

     CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Don't worry about it. She does that
                    all the time.

     BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood
     trickling down her scalp.

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Follow me.

     INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY

     CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti
     approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.

     PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                    You duckin' me Dewight?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

                         (to Scagnetti)
                    This son of a bitch is chairman of the
                    prison board, but it's like pullin'
                    teeth to get him down to a prison.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The only reason I'm here now is to set
                    him straight, and I'm on the next
                    flight out.
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    Jack, this is the superintendent of the
                    jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man
                    who's got the power of the pen here.

     Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

                               WURLITZER
                    Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your
                    book. I'm impressed. Good work on
                    Curtis Fox.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thanks.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    From now on, you'll be dealin' with
                    Phil. He can answer all the questions
                    you got about the arrangements. I'm
                    gonna be bidding you good luck and
                    adieu in about twenty minutes. My
                    flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in
                    a hour.

                               WURLITZER
                    And I want you to know, we'll all cry a
                    river when you're gone.

     They all laugh.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What's the travelling arrangements?

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be
                    together. So, we'll put you on one of
                    our prison busses and you'll take
                    Mallory first, then you'll come back
                    for Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    And where do you keep Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,
                    darkest cell in the whole place. But
                    it just so happens that right now he's
                    got a special visitor.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who?

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne Gayle.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (surprised)
                    Wayne Gayle!

     INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la
     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.
     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a
     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

                               WAYNE
                         (into recorder)
                    Testing one...two...three...
                    testing...one...three...over,
                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It
     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the
     recorder in his sport coat jacket.

     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
     and feet are double cuffed.

     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
     intimidating, and fascinating figure.

     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                         (to himself)
                    Showtime.

     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of
     the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by
     the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello Mickey. We've never been
                    introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I
                    don't know if you've ever heard of me
                    or remember me. I was one of the
                    reporters outside the courthouse during
                    your trial---

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody knows who you are. You're
                    famous.

     Wayne pauses and retorts.

                               WAYNE
                    I could say the same thing about you.
                         (smiles)
                    I want to thank you very much for
                    seeing me...

     Mickey is silent.

                               WAYNE
                    I have a television show. It's very
                    popular. Every week we do a profile on
                    a different serial killer. You don't
                    mind if I call you a serial killer, do
                    you?

     Mickey shakes his head no.

                               WAYNE
                    The episode we did on Mickey and
                    Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               MICKEY
                    Whose ratings were higher?

                               WAYNE
                    Yours.

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on
                    him?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

                               MICKEY
                    Good...yuppie piece of shit.

                               WAYNE
                    What I'd like to do---

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Manson?

                               WAYNE
                    Manson beat you.

                               MICKEY
                    Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the
                    king.

                               WAYNE
                    We've been waiting to do a follow up
                    episode on you for a long time. And
                    that time has definitely come.
                         (pause)
                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
                    hip to what's going on that the prison
                    board has thrown the constitution
                    straight out the fuckin' window.
                    You and Mallory may be killers, but
                    you're not insane. You belong in a
                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison
                    board is blatantly railroading you into
                    a hospital for the sole purpose of
                    turning you into vegetables. Now some
                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
                    one of those people. If we avert our
                    eyes while they do this to you, we give
                    them permission to do it again whenever
                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean
                    your mind because they feel your
                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
                    wipe clean my mind because they feel
                    what I say is dangerous. Where does
                    it all stop?

     No response from Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't
                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
                    on this. I need your help. I want
                    what the prison board is doing to be
                    the focus of our follow up episode.
                    Now I have interviews with chairman of
                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about
                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two
                    psychologists they used for their
                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
                    to us, which always looks bad. I have
                    an interview with both the judge of
                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
                    psychologist and author, Emil
                    Reinghold, both of which discount the
                    notion that you're insane. You put
                    that all together, and what the state
                    is doing becomes obvious. But the
                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the
                    show needs another element. It needs
                    you. In order to put the show on the
                    air, I need to get an interview with
                    you. You haven't talked to the press
                    since your trial. Now, a few days
                    before you get transferred to an
                    asylum, you grant an interview on
                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're
                    talkin' a media event here. Every son
                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's
                    gonna tune in to see that.
                    We'll make their motives so blatant,
                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
                    thing. At least for a little while,
                    the publicity would keep them from just
                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
                    Well, whatta ya say?

                               MICKEY
                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?

                               WAYNE
                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now
                    you're not supposed to know anything
                    about what's going on with her, but I'm
                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you
                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't
                    spoken one word.

                               MICKEY
                    She doesn't talk?

                               WAYNE
                    Not to anybody. She sings.

                               MICKEY
                    She sings? What does she sing?

                               WAYNE
                    Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The
                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty
                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be
                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.
                    Her behaviour was the main thing the
                    doctors' report used against you. So
                    even if she would see me, which she
                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera
                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are
                    you insane?' And she starts singing
                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',
                    that blows our whole case.

     Mickey cracks a smile.

     The guards come over to take him away.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Time, motherfucker!

     They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an
                    answer.

     Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

                               WAYNE
                         (yells after him)
                    Just think about it. But don't think
                    too long.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a
     letter.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.
                    At night I get the chills. I pretend
                    you're lying next to me, holding me
                    from behind with your leg draped over
                    mine and your arms wrapped tightly
                    around me. I lie in my cell...

     DISSOLVE TO:

     WIDE SHOT in cell behind Mickey. We slowly DOLLY back.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    ...and imagine kissing you. Not
                    making love, just kissing for hours and
                    hours on end. I remember everything
                    about our time. I remember every joke
                    you ever told.

     CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    I remember every secret you ever
                    shared. Shared or revealed? I think
                    shared is proper. I remember every
                    single time you laughed.

     ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear
     Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember every meal we ever ate. I
                    remember your cooking. I especially
                    remember your casseroles. I remember
                    watching David Letterman.

     We hear the echo of television laughter.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember driving fast...faster,
                    man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe
                    de Ville.

     The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory,
     driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through
     their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around
     Mickey and kisses.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet
                    up on the dash, singing along with the
                    radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A
                    Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of
                    Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary
                    Goes', 'Groove Me'...

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     Coupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the
     drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on
     the hood of the car.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    And your dancing, my God, your dancing.
                    I lie on my bed and go over every day,
                    every minute of our happiness. Every
                    day take a day of our time and go
                    through it hour by hour. I don't jump
                    ahead either. I take it as it comes,
                    and I live that day again. That way
                    when I get to our first kiss...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear
     in the flame kissing passionately.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    The killing of your parents, our
                    wedding...They're not just memories.
                    I feel that joy again...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face
     and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over
     Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

                               WAYNE
                         (reading out loud)
                    'After taking a few days to reflect on
                    your offer, I've come to the conclusion
                    that you are one hundred percent
                    correct. A national TV interview would
                    be very advantageous to both Mallory
                    and I. The only obstacle is they're
                    shipping me out to the funny farm in
                    four days. However, that is your
                    problem and not mine. I feel confident
                    you'll manage. Here's to us making
                    television history. Sincerely, Mickey
                    Knox.'

     Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

                               WAYNE
                    Am I a God or what?

     We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's
     decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
     remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they
     all pretend they are praying to him.

     The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild
     t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On
     Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears
     wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,
     Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a
     baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
     weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his
     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie
     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are
     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's
     stylish yuppie demeanour.

     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold
     out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks
     straight from the bottle.

     NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl
     Friday' pace.

                               WAYNE
                    Drink up! This is a celebration. This
                    is the day we received word we were
                    gonna make television history. We're
                    gonna have the first sit down, in depth
                    interview with the most charismatic
                    serial killer ever, one day before he's
                    being shipped to a mental hospital for
                    the rest of his life. This is one of
                    those golden moments that happens maybe
                    only four times in a lucky journalist's
                    career. This is Wallace with Noriega,
                    this is Elton John confessing his
                    bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this
                    is the tearful reporting of the
                    Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut
                    setting the record straight on
                    Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,
                    this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting
                    Deep Throat in an underground parking
                    lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The
                    Ten Days That Shook The World', this is
                    the hippies' bloody palms at Kent
                    State, the Maysles brothers at
                    Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost
                    interviews...

                               ROGER
                    This is Raymond Burr witnessing the
                    destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

     Everybody laughs.

                               SCOTT
                    What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

     As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.
     She never speaks, just writes.

                               WAYNE
                    We got tonight and tomorrow to get our
                    shit together. The day after that
                    they're shippin' Mallory. That's when
                    we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause
                    the next day he goes.

                               SCOTT
                    Would the network really not run it
                    without the interview?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The last thing they
                    expected was Mickey Knox to get up
                    close and personal. They wanted a
                    follow up episode and would've taken
                    anything I had given them. I'm not
                    gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna
                    make him think his grey matter depends
                    on it. When I told Woody and the brass
                    about this coup, they practically shit
                    a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.
                    They want to expand the show to a hour,
                    and they want it on immediately.

                               ROGER
                    How immediate is immediately?

                               WAYNE
                    Next week's episode.

     Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.

                               ROGER
                    We don't got enough footage for a hour
                    follow up.

                               SCOTT
                         (pointing at Roger)
                    What he said.

                               WAYNE
                    Rape and pillage the first episode,
                    just change the order a bit. Those
                    sons of bitches out there ain't gonna
                    know the difference. All that shit is
                    just filler for the interview anyway.
                    We film a new intro. Show some old
                    footage from the first episode so the
                    get a brief history of Mickey and
                    Mallory. We introduce a new angle...
                    what the prison board is up to. We
                    see some of that new shit, then the
                    rest of the show is the interview. Now
                    what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,
                    Julie make a note: I need Woody to get
                    me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'
                    broadcast to promote next weeks show.
                    We'll do a feed right from the jail
                    while we're wrapping up with Mickey.

     Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    You too Scott, Betacam and a remote,
                    keep it simple.

     Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.

                               SCOTT
                    Betacam with remote and two-way comm
                    link. Got it.
                         (opens eyes)
                    How about the interview...What camera
                    do you want to use?

     Wayne closes his eyes.
 
                               WAYNE
                    I see...high contrast sixteen
                    millimetre black and white, and I mean
                    black and white, where the black's
                    black and the white's white. This is
                    for posterity, so fuck video. Film!
                    Film! Film!

     Wayne pounds on the table. CU of Unruly Julie writing in her
     notebook: 'Film...film...film!'

                               WAYNE
                    So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and
                    planning the interview.
                         (points at Roger & Scott)
                    You two go down to the editing bay,
                    take the old footage and the new
                    footage, put it together, and see what
                    we got. Get it into shape so when we
                    finish the interview, we can just stick
                    it in.

                               SCOTT
                    When do you want the assembly?

                               WAYNE
                    Tomorrow.

     CAMERA leads Wayne, who's talking to Unruly Julie. As they

                    At that point I'll ask him if he
                    believes in God. If he says yes, I'll
                    ask him what he thinks God would make
                    of his actions. And is he worried
                    about burning in hell? If he says no,
                    I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you
                    believe in?' And hopefully he'll say
                    something like a live round of ammo,
                    the expression on the face of a man he
                    just split up the middle, Mallory's
                    eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.
                    He's bound to say something
                    provocative.

     Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and
     Roger are sitting at the editing bay. Everybody is wearing, and
     looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before,
     except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, boys, let's have it.

                               SCOTT
                    Well, basically, what we did was put
                    part of the old show on first...

                               ROGER
                    But we changed the order around so it
                    wasn't super obvious...

                               SCOTT
                    Then we added the new shit to the

                    So we film the interview, and we can
                    just slap it on at the end.

     Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE is standing in the middle of an empty highway. The
     CAMERA looks up from the ground. With a WIDE ANGLE lens, he
     looks practically mythic.

     Wayne speaks into the camera.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello. Welcome to 'American Maniacs'.
                    I'm your host Wayne Gayle. And this is

                    point A and point B. To others a
                    beautiful stretch to the American
                    landscape. But to Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox, it was a candy land of murder and
                    mayhem.

     While we hear Wayne's narration, we see a MONTAGE of home 8mm
     movie footage. These are films of Mickey and Mallory living a
     normal life.

     ground near them, holding his hands over his face, screaming.

     To the left Mallory is slugging it out with a windbreaker COP,
     matching each other blow for blow.

     Meanwhile, the three cops we ran with reach the action and join

                    kill everybody when they're through,
                    except for one clerk. There were a
                    couple of people in the store then, and
                    I was working with Stevo. And I like
                    Stevo, you know? But I was thinking,

                    be the clerk that gets to live?

     shotguns and shouting things.

     Mickey SHOOTS a CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

     Mallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

     Mickey points his shotgun at Bishop the store clerk and screams:

                    Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast!
                    Faster! Faster! Faster than that!

     Bishop stuffs money in a bag as Mallory guards the door, shotgun
     ready.

     STEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room
     carrying boxes and wearing a walkman.

     Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him.

     As all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes, Wayne's
     narration happens over it.

                    The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder
                    trial was so event filled it made the
                    crime spree that took place before pale
                    by comparison. The first point was the
                    decision of Mickey's to act as his own
                    council. Now this in itself is not
                    unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy
                    acted as his own council as well. What
                    was unexpected was how well Mickey's
                    performance would be.

     Wayne interviews JUDGE BURT STEINSMA in his den at home.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was
                    the presiding judge during the Knox
                    trial.

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Mickey was surprisingly effective.
                    When I was told I was to be the judge
                    of this trial and then I was told
                    Mickey Knox would be handling his own
                    defence, I got a headache that lasted
                    five days. But at first I breathed a
                    sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very
                    prepared, and proved to be an excellent
                    amateur lawyer.

                    However, this opinion isn't shared by
                    the state's prosecutor on this case,
                    Wanda Bisbing.

     Wayne's with Bisbing.

                               WAYNE
                    Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed
                    up very prepared and proved to be an
                    excellent amateur attorney.

                               BISBING
                    Oh, that's rich. Well, considering
                    that Mickey Knox turn his court into
                    a mockery and personally made him look
                    like a fool, I'd say that's very
                    benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far
                    as Mickey being an excellent amateur
                    lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but
                    when I went to law school, we were
                    taught the object was to win the case,
                    which I did.

                    What do you think of Mickey and
                    Mallory?

                               CHUCK
                    Hot.

                               JEFF

                               STEVE
                    Totally hot.

                               CHUCK
                    Mickey and Mallory's the best thing to
                    happen to mass murder since Manson.

                               STEVE

                    cooler than Manson.

                    Well, he's just...I dunno...
                    charismatic.

                    two shit asses (BLEEP) the stiffest
                    sentence the law allows. I want to see
                    their faces when the state says 'they
                    are the worst scum sucking, degenerate,
                    douche bag, filthy, I don't know what's

                    And these assholes (BLEEP) are making
                    heroes outta sickos. You wanna know

                    Griffin. Mike fuckin' (BLEEP) Griffin
                    is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP)
                    should be revering. You know why Mike
                    Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya
                    why. Because he was killed in the line
                    of duty. Do you want to know how he
                    died?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               INTENSE COP
                    I'll tell you. Mike Jerome Griffin was
                    killed in the line of duty by those two
                    anti-heroes.

                    what is your opinion of Mickey Knox's
                    performance?

                    Ahhh, Mickey's pistolero savvy in the
                    courtroom trial rivals, dare I say
                    conquers that of master Melvin Belli.
                    He's like a magnificent loose cannon,
                    firing point blank in the prosecutor's
                    face. It is my anticipation---

                               WAYNE
                    You're talking about a man and a woman
                    who killed innocent people.

                               STEVE
                    Don't get us wrong...

                               CHUCK
                    We respect human life an' all.

                               JEFF
                    It's a tragedy.

                               STEVE
                    But...if I was a serial killer,
                    which I'm not, but if I was, I'd be

     Wayne's sitting in the gym. Behind him MUSCLE MEN are working
     out. Their GRUNTING sounds fill the background. Wayne looks up
     and just OFF CAMERA to the people he's interviewing.

                               WAYNE
                    What do you think of Mickey and
                    Mallory?

     ECU on SIMON and NORMAN HUN, two brothers/bodybuilders, in a
     head SHOT.

                               SIMON
                    I admire them.

                               NORMAN
                    I do, too.

                               WAYNE
                         (confused)
                    But how can you say that?

                               SIMON
                    They're mesmerising.

                               NORMAN
                    Hypnotizing.

                               SIMON
                    Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               NORMAN
                    Then you've seen the scene where Arnold
                    Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou
                    Ferigno.

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               SIMON
                    Through the power of the simple word---

                               NORMAN
                    And a snake-eye glare.

                               SIMON
                    ---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was
                    able to totally psyche out any
                    confidence Ferigno had.

                               NORMAN
                    He squashed him mentally before
                    physically defeating him.

                               SIMON
                    He had the edge. The mind's edge.

                               NORMAN
                    Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

                               SIMON
                    Only on a much grander scale.

                               NORMAN
                    They've hypnotized the nation.

                               SIMON
                    Schwartzenegger was the king of the
                    edge before they came along.

     The CU of the brothers ZOOMS back.

                               WAYNE
                    You say this and yet...you two are
                    both victims of Mickey and Mallory.

     SHOT has zoomed back to reveal that both Simon and Norman are in
     wheelchairs (their legs maimed or gone).

                               SIMON
                    Yes.

                               NORMAN
                    Yes.

                               WAYNE
                    How can you say that you 'admire' them?

                               NORMAN
                    It's like this, Wayne. Two people are
                    standing in a dark room waiting for the
                    other to attack. These two people
                    can't see each other, yet they know
                    they're there. Now, they can either
                    stand in the dark room forever waiting
                    until they die of boredom, or one of
                    them can make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    Why can't they just shake hands and be
                    friends?

                               NORMAN
                    They can't because neither knows if the
                    other is a deranged senseless killer
                    like the Knoxs. So, you may as well
                    make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    And they made the first move?

                               NORMAN
                    Unfortunately, yes.

                               SIMON
                    But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    Why?

                               SIMON
                    They passed the 'edge' along to us.

                               WAYNE
                    How so?

                               SIMON
                    By taking away our legs. Now we have
                    to fight harder to get ahead than
                    anyone else you'll find in this gym.
                    Probably the whole city. They gave us
                    the fighting spirit. Before this
                    happened I was content. Now I'm pissed
                    off. Now I'm half a man and I've got
                    to work like the devil to get whole
                    again.

                               WAYNE
                    But you'll never be whole again.

                               SIMON
                    Never is a very long time, Wayne. A
                    word only the weak use. I'm not a sore
                    loser. Even if I don't have a leg to
                    stand on, I'm going to get up and fight
                    this world until I'm on top again.

                               NORMAN
                    That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

                               SIMON
                    That's the way of the world.

                               NORMAN
                    They're shocking the world into
                    remembering the primal law.

                               SIMON
                    Survival of the fittest.

                               WAYNE
                    One last question. Usually Mickey and
                    Mallory kill all of their victims. Why
                    did they let you two survive?

     The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

                               NORMAN
                    They had us tied down during one of
                    their house raids, you've seen the
                    headlines, and they were taking a
                    chainsaw to our legs before they were
                    gonna kill us.

                               SIMON
                    Just for fun, I guess.

                               NORMAN
                    And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,
                    'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

                               SIMON
                    Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,
                    'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

                               NORMAN
                    Apparently, they've seen all our films.

                               SIMON
                    They were especially influenced by
                    'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

                               NORMAN
                    So, Mallory calls 911 and they took
                    off.

                               SIMON
                    They actually apologized.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

     Wayne enters an editing room where filmmaker NEIL POPE is
     working at a movieola.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We talked with Neil Pope, writer and
                    director of 'Thrill Killers' for his
                    take on the Mickey and Mallory
                    phenomena.

     Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets
     Wayne M.O.S.

     CUT INTO INTERVIEW:

                               NEIL POPE
                    It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox are a cultural phenomena that
                    could only exist in our sexually
                    repressed society. A flower that could
                    only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
                    culture. A what I tried to do with
                    'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of
                    the problem all the way down the vine
                    to the original bad seed. Yet amidst
                    the violence and murder and carnage,
                    you've got the structure of a Wagnerian
                    love story.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.
     The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,
     shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,
     where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up
     against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the
     subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, honey, listen to me.

     Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,
                    but--

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't run with you, Mickey! I really
                    want to. If I could, I would, but I
                    can't. I gotta stay here. But you can
                    still get out of here.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    If they stay, they'll catch you, and
                    they don't have to catch you---

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, you're wasting time!

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I don't give a damn if a million United
                    States marines, all whistling the halls
                    of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'
                    down this alley any second. There
                    ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm
                    leaving you. And that's that!

     Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

     The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, my love, if you leave me,
                    they'll catch me and take me to the
                    hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em
                    kill you. Then it'd be like I killed
                    you. I could bear anything, but I
                    couldn't bear that. So please, please,
                    for me, my handsome
                    husband, run for your life.

     The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I can't do it. You're my wife, you're
                    my partner. A fella doesn't run when
                    his partner can't run with him.
                    Mallory, my angel, if I could of left
                    ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

     They kiss.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me
                    a gun so I can go out shooting.

     Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little
                    tougher for 'em.

     Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the
     corner at the arriving COPS.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                         (to himself)
                    Time to get naked and boogie.

     Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,
     then places the barrel under her chin.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey!

     Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Yeah baby.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    You made every day like kindergarten.

     Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

     DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

     Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless
     body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

     Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Mallory!

                                                    CUT TO:

     BACK TO: THE POPE INTERVIEW

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Why did you kill Mallory? Both of
                    them are still alive.

                               NEIL POPE
                    It was dramatic license, no doubt. But
                    I felt an operatic love story needed an
                    operatic ending. The two of them kill
                    for each other. They offer the death
                    of their victims to each other like
                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.
                    So what more natural, what more
                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory
                    offering her death to Mickey? It's
                    where it's been leading since day one.
                    We worked it in the movie by using a
                    what if they escaped situation. I
                    think it works beautifully. You'd be
                    surprised. People come up to me at the
                    end of the movie in tears.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks
     to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna
     is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.
     His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               JESSIE
                    One thing about Mickey for sure, he's
                    definitely a man who has his moments.
                    It was wild playin' him. It was one of
                    those get-it-out-of-your-system
                    performances.

     INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY

     This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.
     BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her
     lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name
     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               BUFFY
                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I
                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played
                    her as a woman in love, who also
                    happens to murder people. I didn't
                    want her to be at arm's length from the
                    audience or myself. If you play her as
                    this wild maniac, the audience never
                    has to deal with her. If you see a
                    decapitation in a movie, you just say
                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'
                    Because you can't relate to a
                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything
                    to anybody because it's not personal.
                    Decapitations don't fall into most
                    people's realm of life experiences.
                    But if you show somebody in a movie
                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience
                    squirms. Because everybody can relate
                    to a paper cut.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

                               BUFFY
                    I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.
                    But I read some letters she wrote to
                    Mickey before the murder spree. They
                    helped me out a lot.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Jessie talks to CAMERA.

                               WAYNE (O.S)
                    You met Mickey Knox, didn't you?

                               JESSIE
                    Yeah, I visited him when he was up in
                    Susanville. He's a little cerebral for
                    my taste, but all in all, we got along.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.
     REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    To get a psychiatric view on the
                    strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
                    seems to have, we talked with Doctor
                    Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and
                    author.

     Wayne begins his interview.

                               WAYNE
                    Can you shed some light, Doctor
                    Reinghold, on why the public has taken
                    a pair of sociopaths so close to their
                    bosom?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Well, for one, the media has done a
                    tremendous job of turning the husband
                    and wife mass murderers into
                    celebrities. But it's the country's
                    youth who have turned the couple into
                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
                    the very thing that makes them most
                    lethal is the exact same thing that
                    captures the public's hearts and
                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
                    devotion to each other. In a world
                    where people can't seem to make the
                    simplest relationships work and the
                    slightest emotional commitment is
                    considered devastating, Mick and
                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the
                    country's youth, 75 percent of which
                    are coming from broken homes, that's
                    appealing. They have an 'us against
                    the world' posture which always appeals
                    to youth. And they've taken that
                    posture seventeen steps beyond.
                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's
                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
                    exciting. I read their file and I find
                    myself turning the page like it was a
                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
                    disillusioned housewives read romance
                    novels? Why are you filming this
                    special? Because you know as well as I
                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to
                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey
                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb
                    with violence. They've created a world
                    where only two exist and anybody who
                    inadvertently enters that world is
                    murdered.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    This attitude from the young towards
                    their ultimate anti-heroes is nation
                    wide. And spreading.

                    You take all the great figures from the
                    States...Elvis, Jack Keroac,

                    bloody pale of nitro and you got Mickey
                    and Mallory. They're like rebels
                    without a cause, except they have a
                    cause. Only nobody knows what it is.

                    And as to almost give this whole
                    misplaced admiration scenario a cherry
                    on the top, the rock band Redd Kross
                    entered the charts last week at number
                    13 with their song 'Natural Born
                    Killers, The Saga of Mickey and
                    Mallory.'

                    The third wicked twist to this story is
                    Grace Mulberry.

     FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER - Headline reads: 'MICKEY AND MALLORY KILL
     SIX TEENS DURING SLUMBER PARTY!' In smaller bold face under it:
     'One Teen Escapes Killer's Clutches.' On the front page is a
     PHOTO of the teen who escaped. It's seventeen year old GRACE
     MULBERRY. CAMERA moves in CU of the photo.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Of the six teens murdered that night,
                    seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was
                    the lucky one left to tell the tale.
                    And this haunted young lady summoned up
                    the courage to take the stand, tell
                    what she saw that horrible night, and
                    then allow herself to be cross-examined
                    by the man who killed her brother and
                    girlfriends.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media
     event.

     Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators
     and reporters surround the car.

     Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start
     walking up the courthouse steps.

     Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask
     questions.

     Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the
     direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

     She remains silent and scared.

                    Miss Mulberry! How does it feel to be
                    the only survivor of Mickey and

                    Miss Mulberry! Has the experience
                    marked you?

     Some scruffy TRANSIENT sticks his head in Grace's face.

                               TRANSIENT
                    Did ya watch your brother get stabbed
                    up?

                    How do you feel about Mickey cross-
                    examining you?

     Grace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the
     crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we
     hear the cry of:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mickey and Mallory!

     CAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying
     Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps
     they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit.

     Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by
     SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them
     and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their
     faces.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey, how do you feel about cross-
                    examining Grace Mulberry?

                               MICKEY
                    I'm keen with anticipation.

                    Do you have any regrets?

                               MALLORY
                    Not a one.

                               MICKEY
                    Yeah, I always regretted we never got
                    around to looking up my old history
                    teacher, Miss Bainbridge. Now there's
                    a big bad bitch not good for herself or
                    nobody.

     Mallory playfully elbows Mickey in his ribs.

                               MICKEY
                    Oh, I'd say watching TV.

                    No, apparently we had not seen
                    everything. Grace Mulberry gave her
                    tearful testimony. Then it became
                    Mickey Knox's turn for cross-
                    examination.

                    Grace was terrified of Mickey. You
                    have to understand most of their
                    victims were normal people with normal
                    lives that nothing out of the ordinary
                    ever happens to.

     COURT SKETCH of Mickey looking like the devil himself.

                    Then out of the blue, they're dealing
                    with the devil incarnate. It was
                    extremely difficult for us to find
                    survivors who would take the stand and
                    testify when they knew Mickey would be
                    cross-examining them.

                    Grace was every bit as terrified, every
                    bit as haunted. But she felt her
                    brother Tim and her five girlfriends
                    were counting on her.

     COURT SKETCH - CU of Grace staring intently. CAMERA widens to
     include Bisbing standing before the bench as Mickey sits with
     Mallory at the defence table. Judge Steinsma looks down at
     Grace. The distinct sounds of a court in session can be heard
     in the B.G.

     The color of the scene FADES to Black & White as the CAMERA
     cranes up to reveal the COURT ARTIST drawing while court is in
     session.

     OFF SCREEN: Bisbing is wrapping up her examination of Grace who
     is at the witness stand. Judge Steinsma resides at his bench.

     CAMERA dollies into a MED. OVERHEAD TWO-SHOT of Mickey and
     Mallory who are sketching on a pad of paper. CAMERA reveals the
     drawing of a man stabbing a woman. Mickey is doing the actual
     drawing, but every once and a while Mallory takes to pencil and
     adds some touches, as Grace finishes her tearful testimony.

                               BISBING (O.S.)
                    No further questions, your honor.

     Emotional pause, the silence.

                               JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.)
                    Would you care to cross examine the
                    witness, Mr. Knox?

     Mickey scratches out the drawing. Still holding the pencil he
     stands and leaves frame.

                               MICKEY (O.S)
                    As a matter of fact, your honor, I
                    would.

     NOTE: The following scene is to be played with EXTREME CLOSE
     UPS. Not once is the courtroom seen in detail. However
     courtroom sound can be heard vividly in the B.G.

     CU of Mallory, who grins at Mickey like a Cheshire cat.

     CU of Grace's eyes as they look downward.

     CU of Judge Steinsma as he shuffles paper on his bench.

     CU of Mickey's feet crossing the court floor.

     CU of Bisbing as her eyes follow Mickey across the court.
     Mickey enters the frame, with a pencil pressed to his lips in
     though. Mickey is looking straight into the CAMERA.

     Mickey's POV of Grace sitting on the witness stand, staring into
     her lap.

     ECU of Grace's finger rolling a large, male-style, High School
     class ring around her palm.

     CU of Mickey glancing to the ring. Mickey smiles.

     Mickey's POV of Grace as she pulls from a reserve of strength.
     Clenching the ring tight in her fist, her eyes come up and lock
     hatefully on Mickey.

     CU Mickey as he walks forward towards Grace.

                               MICKEY

                    Yes it is.

     At this point Mickey begins to pace from right to left, but
     always remaining in CU.

     She's back at the night of the murder.

     Mickey's wearing a black leather jacket over a white t-shirt,
     which is covered with blood. Blood is smeared on his face, and
     he's holding a knife pressed to his lips, also covered with
     blood. But he's walking and talking with the same manner and
     poise as in the courtroom.

                    When you study the martial arts, they
                    give out belts that come in different

                    Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,
                    could you tell us what form of martial
                    arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

                               GRACE
                    Tim studied several styles, but his
                    favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

                               MICKEY
                    Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research
                    on that form of fighting, and I found
                    out that Jeet Kune Do was a style
                    developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know
                    that?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.
                    Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting
                    style.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, while I freely admit total
                    ignorance on the subject, I have heard
                    of Bruce Lee. And I was under the
                    impression that Bruce Lee was one of
                    the, if not the greatest fighter in the
                    history of martial arts.

                               GRACE
                    That's what Tim said.

                               MICKEY
                    So, I think it would be safe to say
                    that anybody who studied the fighting
                    style that Bruce Lee, arguably the
                    greatest martial artist of all times,
                    developed for nine years, that would be
                    a fella who could defend himself.
                    Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I would.

                               MICKEY

                    registered as lethal weapons?

                               MICKEY
                    That means his hands are considered a
                    weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I
                    correct on that point?

                    Steinsma, passed down a sentence that
                    was to make legal history.

     Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home.

     M.O.S. SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at
                    his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

     The interview:

                               WAYNE
                    Was there any vengeance on your part
                    with your unique sentence?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Yes, unquestionably. After they did
                    what they did in my court, and judge
                    worth his robe will tell you the same
                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my
                    decision. That's why they have judges.
                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
                    but when it's showtime, we have to make
                    a decision. That's why we don't just
                    input all the facts into a computer for
                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
                    give them the death penalty. See,
                    California hops back and forth on that
                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
                    court when it was out of favor, which
                    is actually good because it leaves more
                    room for imagination. Anybody can give
                    somebody the chair. When you have
                    someone who deserves to die and you
                    can't kill them, you have to be
                    creative. And if the bastards had let
                    it stand, it would of been the perfect
                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they
                    lived. Far more punishing than the
                    death sentence.

                               WAYNE
                    Would you please describe for our
                    viewers what your sentence was?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,
                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day
                    and they're a very cold lot. They have
                    no more feelings about taking a
                    person's life than squashing a tiny
                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
                    to watch their expression change'
                    attitude personified. Except with each
                    other. And, since they lived only for
                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at
                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
                    sentence was double life for each
                    without any possibility for parole.
                    That would be fairly standard in their
                    case. The twist I added was that the
                    husband and wife would have no contact
                    or correspondence with each other for
                    the rest of their lives. And they
                    would never receive any word or
                    information about the other.
                    So, basically once the cell door slams
                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will
                    completely disappear from each other's
                    life. They'll never know when the
                    other dies. But alas, the best laid
                    plans of mice and men...

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We talked with Dewight McClusky,
                    chairman of the California State Prison
                    Board, about this curious turn of
                    events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

     INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne's interviewing McClusky.

                               WAYNE
                    Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
                    to an asylum? And who made the
                    decision?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board made the decision. A
                    board of which I belong. We're the
                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and
                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully
                    they'll receive the help they need.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed
                    competent in a mental examination
                    before their trial. I'm confused.
                    What's changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, since that time, they've killed
                    one person during their trail. And
                    since their incarceration, they've
                    killed one psychologist along with
                    several guards and inmates.

                               WAYNE
                    When they were found competent before,
                    they had already killed fifty people.
                    Other than the fact they're a
                    disciplinary problem, which frankly
                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still
                    don't see where this situation is any
                    different then it was before. So, I
                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's
                    changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our
                    minds. We felt they were competent a
                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a
                    year where they were under close
                    observation, day in and day out, and
                    their behaviour has led us to believe we
                    were wrong.

                               WAYNE
                    Who is we?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board and the doctors who
                    examined them.

                               WAYNE
                    Were any of the doctors who made the
                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
                    state asked to re-examine them?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Using the same doctors is not common
                    practice.

                               WAYNE
                    I take it by your answer it was a whole
                    new team?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They
                    were different men. I hadn't really
                    thought that much about it. Since many
                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,
                    sought out for this kind of situation.
                    What do you think normally happens?
                    The Knoxs are assigned a family
                    psychologist that takes care of them
                    throughout the rest of their lives?
                    The state doesn't work like that.

                    The two psychiatric opinions the board
                    sought were those of Albert

                    ...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the
                    good doctors, for whatever reason,
                    refused to be interviewed.

     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    It's a funny situation actually. If
                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
                    a damn, what the prison board is doing
                    would be considered an outrage. The
                    prison board is basically saying, 'We
                    can't handle these guys.' They've
                    moved 'em around twice since their
                    sentence started.
                    They were a handful everywhere they
                    went. Now the prisons they're at now
                    want them outta there. But no other
                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
                    'em. So the prison board is left
                    scratching their heads wondering what
                    they're gonna do. Well, what they
                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
                    medical court that found them crazy.
                    Then they get them transferred to
                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric
                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and
                    Mallory cease to be a problem to
                    anybody except the orderlies who clean
                    out the bedpans, which if you want to
                    see them get theirs, that's all well
                    and good. But there's something being
                    said here. Forget the immorality for a
                    second. Forget the corruption and the
                    skulduggery involved. What the board
                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and
                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.
                    They were put in an alternative society
                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the
                    powers that be, can't deal with these
                    two kids. And whatever can't be
                    assimilated has to be terminated.

                               WAYNE
                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
                    are not insane?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace
                    to living creatures, yes. But to
                    suggest that they're insane gives the
                    impression that they don't know right
                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know
                    the difference between right and wrong.
                    They just don't give a damn.

     INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

     Wayne's just finished viewing the show. He puts his hands on
     Scott and Roger's shoulders.

                               WAYNE
                    Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'-
                    tastic! I think that interview stuff's
                    too long, we can lose some of that.
                    Keep the girls, keep the long hairs,
                    keep the Hun brothers, keep the black
                    guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the
                    cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest.
                    And cut the interview with the prison
                    board fellow before that. Cut it after
                    I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was
                    a whole new team.' Don't even let him
                    answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me
                    talking about the two chicken shit
                    psychiatrists and straight in Dr.
                    Reinghold laughing.

                               SCOTT
                    Okay.

     Wayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie.

                               WAYNE
                    Children, we have a show.
                         (to Scott & Roger)
                    You two get some long well overdue
                    sleep. 'Cause tomorrow, bright and
                    early, county jail and then journey's
                    end...Mickey Knox.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey's pacing back and forth in his cell, trying out different
     jokes.

                               MICKEY
                    There's this Italian guy, a French guy,
                    and a Polish guy. And they're all
                    talkin' about how they fuck their
                    wives---

                               MICKEY
                    ...You know, I'm gonna just rip off
                    your dress and squeeze your titties.
                    Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out
                    her .357, sticks it in the Big Bad
                    Wolf's face and says, 'No you're not.
                    You're gonna eat me...just like the
                    story says.'

                         (with a lisp)
                    ...Fairy boat! I knew things were
                    good in here, but I didn't know we had
                    our own Navy.

                               MICKEY
                    ...So this guy wants to take little
                    Johnny's sister to the drive-in. But
                    the mother says, 'Only if you take
                    little Johnny along---'

                               MICKEY
                    ...And the Polish guy says, 'That's
                    nothing. When I get through with my
                    Hanna, I get up, wipe my dick on the
                    curtain, and she hits the roof!'

                    too kind...no...please...

     INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY

     Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE -
     16mm.

     NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are
     filming handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise
     specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

     Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the
     back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front
     driving.

                               WAYNE
                         (with mouthful of donut)
                    How's it working, Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Perfecto!

     Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to
     him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

                               ROGER
                    Where the fuck's the chocolate cream
                    filled? Did anyone get my chocolate
                    cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

     CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

                               ROGER
                    I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.
                    You saw me do it, didn't you?

     Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    You were there. Did you see him put it
                    in a box?

     We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

                               ROGER
                    At the time, I was too busy explaining
                    to Scott the finer points of film.

     We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Yeah, right. You know what he said?
                    He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple
                    Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

     Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

                               WAYNE
                         (to Roger)
                    You can't be serious?

                               ROGER
                         (preoccupied)
                    I'm as serious about that as I am about
                    going back to the donut store, and
                    dipping that stupid Mexican's head into
                    the batter for forgetting my chocolate
                    cream filled. Gimme that other box.

                               WAYNE
                    Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

                               ROGER
                    That dumbass probably put my chocolate
                    cream filled in there by mistake.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, no.

                               ROGER
                    What's the big deal? Take out my
                    chocolate cream filled, put one of
                    these roasted coconut---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, do you understand what the word
                    'no' means? It's important we
                    establish a rapport. Something as
                    simple as a dozen donuts can mean the
                    world to somebody who hasn't had a
                    donut in a year.

                               ROGER
                    So you're giving a man who butchers
                    whole families, little babies included,
                    my chocolate cream filled?

     Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the
     windshield.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County
                    Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

                               ROGER
                    Wayne---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.
                    Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and
                    gather your gear.

     The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent
     Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

                               WAYNE
                         (aside to Scott)
                    Here's the welcome wagon.

     Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

                               WURLITZER
                    Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.
                    We talked on the phone. It's a
                    pleasure to meet you.

                               WAYNE
                    Same here. Let me introduce my crew.
                    Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie
                    ...this is...I'm sorry. What's
                    your title again?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm the superintendent here at L.A.
                    County Jail. Me and my deputies are
                    who you'll be working with while you're
                    here.

                               WAYNE
                    That sounds great. Look, I don't want
                    any of this to intimidate you. This is
                    not going to be a big deal. This is
                    going to be very easy.
                         (to his crew)
                    I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You
                    guys get your equipment ready, power up
                    the van and confirm a transmission code
                    for the remote. Julie come with me.

     Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks
     confidentially to Wurlitzer.

                               WAYNE
                    The main thing I need is a big room,
                    shut off from the population, so we can
                    get some privacy...with a few
                    electrical outlets.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from
     the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect
     for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS
     around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his
     sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

     Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA
     moves from person to person without cutting.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to two Deputies)
                    This is just for an interview, I was
                    on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.
                    It was a much bigger deal than this.
                    They had a crew of maybe seventy-five
                    people.

     CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    We're gonna be talking over here. But
                    I want enough freedom so if I wanna get
                    up and move around, we can.

     Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

                               WAYNE
                    Take him and walk him over this way.
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,
                    what the hell was that all about?
                         (pauses--to Scott)
                    Then maybe take him to the window.

     He walks Scott to the window.

                               WAYNE
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail
                    today, what's the first thing you'd do?
                         (pause--to Scott)
                    Little shit like that. I don't wanna
                    have to feel I gotta stay in the
                    chairs. We're after a cinema verite,
                    anything can happen, truth twenty-four
                    times a second kindda feel.

     End of single SHOT.

     Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    And when it's lunch time, they don't
                    just go to McDonalds. They got cooks
                    there servin' great food. Swedish
                    meatballs...

     Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

                               WAYNE
                    Everything's coming along just fine.
                    Phil, I wanted to know if I could have
                    a small word with you.

                               WURLITZER
                    By all means.

     Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around
     the room.

                               WAYNE
                    You met the kids I have working for me?
                    Great bunch, aren't they?

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

                               WAYNE
                    Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,
                    magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I
                    could sooner do without my arm than
                    Unruly Julie.

                               WURLITZER
                    Is that her real name?

                               WAYNE
                    Just a little nickname. Yep, they're
                    my kids and they're all I need. After
                    working together these past coupla
                    years, we're like well-oiled machinery.
                    No, more like a Formula race car. No,
                    scratch that one, too. What we're
                    really like is a Swiss watch. Small,
                    intricate, compact...it shouldn't
                    work as well as it does, but it does.
                    Because of the craftsmanship, the
                    expertise, and the artist's loving
                    hand.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

                               WURLITZER
                    I see.

                               WAYNE
                    Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever
                    been on a set before---

                               WURLITZER
                         (proudly)
                    Ya know, I was.

                               WAYNE
                         (acting surprised)
                    Really?

                               WURLITZER
                    I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set
                    about eight years ago.

                               WAYNE
                         (still acting surprised)
                    Well...small world. Well, then, you
                    know firsthand how Hollywood does
                    things. Lights all over the place,
                    generators, a hundred and fifty crew
                    members---

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there
                    was probably ninety-five people there,
                    maybe more.

                               WAYNE
                    See what I mean? It's a funny
                    business, isn't it?

                               WURLITZER
                    It sure is.

                               WAYNE
                    They got a asshole over here.
                         (pointing to his left)
                    A asshole sitting down reading a
                    magazine over there.
                         (points to his right)
                    A asshole perched up there.
                         (points straight up)
                    Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we
                    were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang
                    stuff we'd need all those assholes,
                    too. What we're about is intimacy.
                    We're about two people having a
                    conversation. Say I was interviewing
                    you. All I want you to worry about is
                    what I ask you. I want a trust to
                    develop. If you're thinking about all
                    this...
                         (indicates the hustle and
                         bustle of a set)
                    ...you're not going to relax, a trust
                    won't develop, we'll be talking a each
                    other instead of to each other, there
                    will be no chance for intimacy.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

                               WAYNE
                    That's why my crew is only three...an
                    invisible three.
                         (switching gears)
                    Which brings me to what I wanted to
                    talk to you about. I have to get
                    Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to
                    share what he's never shared before...
                    Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till
                    today have been closed. Well, how can
                    we expect him to do that when we got
                    Los Angeles County Sheriffs up
                    the walls.

     Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                         (snorts)
                    Well, just what the hell do you expect
                    me to do?

                               WAYNE
                    Lose 'em.

                               WURLITZER
                    Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest
                    idea how dangerous Knox is?

                               WAYNE
                    Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very
                    familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

     They're out and out angry.

                               WURLITZER
                    Since he and his wife have been in
                    custody, they've killed---

                               WAYNE
                    Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure
                    I know 'em better than you do.

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, let me let you in on one more fact you
                    obviously don't know. If I were to
                    take my men away, Mickey Knox would
                    snap your neck like a twig.

                               WAYNE
                    One...I can take care of myself. I
                    grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and
                    I've handled some pretty rough
                    customers in my day. Mickey Knox
                    doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a
                    journalist, and I'm prepared to take
                    that risk. Three...it ain't gonna
                    happen. Believe me when I tell you, it
                    is in Mickey Knox's own best interest
                    to play this game according to Hoyle.
                         (pause)
                    Wait a minute. We've gotten into a
                    advisory relationship here, which is
                    not what I want.
                         (pause)
                    But seriously, Phil, look at this.

     Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.

                               WAYNE
                         (counting)
                    We got one...two...three...four
                    ...five...six...seven...eight.
                    I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too
                    much. Let's lose some of these guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne, if it was anybody else---

                               WAYNE
                    Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam
                    up on me with all these sheriffs all
                    over the place. They hate him. He
                    hates them. What kinda intimacy am I
                    gonna create with all this hate in the
                    air. Even you and I feel it.

                               WURLITZER
                    What are we talking about?

                               WAYNE
                    Two guys?

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay. I'll take two guys off.

                               WAYNE
                    No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two
                    guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    I can't do that. Five guys.

                               WAYNE
                    Three.

                               WURLITZER
                    I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but
                    that's it.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head.

     CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in
     the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open.
     The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and
     shackles.

                               DEPUTY #1
                    On your feet! Turn your face to the
                    wall.

     Mickey gets up.

                               MICKEY
                    Now what you're supposed to say is:
                    'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

     OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

     CU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell
     door makes her up with a jolt.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Rise and shine, Mallory!

     Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two
     deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and
     WASHINGTON.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and
     Washington's shiny black shoes.

     The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,
     along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,
     reverberates throughout the scene.

     Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding
     deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a
     cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long
                    and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

     Mallory looks straight ahead.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    See, I've been there twice. And I'm
                    not lookin' forward to goin' back. But
                    I'm in and out. You, on the other
                    hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the
                    rest of your life there. Now that's
                    what I call cruel and inhuman
                    punishment.

     Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Course you're not gonna give a shit.
                    'Cause when the good doctor's get
                    through givin' you the zap...
                         (he puts his finger next
                         to his temple, pantomimes
                         being electrocuted)
                    ...You won't know where the hell you
                    are. They'll just put you on a window
                    sill, and water you every other day.
                       
     Mallory lets out a big yawn.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly
     Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his
     entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally
     bursting into laughter.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    And when he gets here, its no dick'n
                    around time. Make him up, clip a mike
                    on him, then leave him alone. I don't
                    want you talking to him. I don't want
                    you getting in his face. I want you
                    hiding behind your gear. You are
                    invisible.

     CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the
     supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how
     he can still walk.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    Okay, break.

     Wayne's team disburses.

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

     Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others
     start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.

     Wayne approaches Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Wayne)
                    Okay now, before we get started here,
                    there's a few things we have to get
                    clear about.

                               WAYNE
                    All right, Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove
     the chains.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The
     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring
     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to
     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's
     wrists.

     Mallory's silent.

     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

                               BINGHAM
                    Turn around and face the wall!

     Mallory does.

     Bingham and Washington move to the door.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Wait outside for a second, fellas.

                               BINGHAM
                    We're not supposed---

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Don't worry about it.

     Bingham and Washington move outside.

     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before
     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back
     to him.

     Scagnetti walks up behind her.

     Mallory doesn't move.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Want a smoke?

     Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    C'mon, I already lit one for you. I
                    know you smoke.

     Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
     mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of
     Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I was reading the file on you. You
                    know what it said during your
                    trial, whenever they put you on the
                    stand, no matter what they asked, your
                    answer was always the same...'I love
                    Mickey.' It also says that when they
                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'
                    was the only thing you said that
                    registered as the truth.

     Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky
                    Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your
                    Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is
                    that the attraction? Or does he just
                    got a big dick?

     Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a
                    big donkey dick.

     Scagnetti presses closer.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is
                    close your eyes and remember...
                    remember the last time ol' Mickey gave
                    you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'
                    about it? Good. Remember it. Don't
                    ever forget it cause it ain't never
                    gonna happen again. Cause when they
                    get through with all that electroshock
                    shit they got lined up for you two,
                    Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

     Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.
     Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Look. You're gonna sit here for a
                    couple hours while I finish up the
                    arrangements. The reason they picked
                    me to be your chaperone is they know I
                    won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.
                     
     Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, during our journey, if any wild
                    hairs spring up on your ass, you'd
                    better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with
                    me, bitch, even a little bit, you're
                    gonna get accidentally shot!
                    Comprehende?

     Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD
     BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a
     horrible scream.

     EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell
     door.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti
     face down on the ground.

     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break
     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's
     screaming.

     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their
     shotguns.

     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,
     screaming.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    She broke my fucking nose! That bitch
                    broke my nose!

     Washington comes over to him and helps him up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (blood down his face)
                    She broke my nose.

                               WASHINGTON
                    I'll fix it.

     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.
     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down
     from the pain.

     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down
     from his face, looking over at Mallory.

     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun
     barrel placed in her mouth.

     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold her, boys.

     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun
     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on
     either side of her, holding her in place.

     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings
     it up to Mallory's face.

     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
     eyes, and all over her body.

     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on
     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They
     can't look at this anymore.

     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her
     all over her body.

     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the
     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can
     back to Washington.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I want this filled before we leave.

     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking
     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of
     excruciating pain.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a
     microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to
     Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    How come you never talk?

                               ROGER
                    She was born without a tongue.

                               MICKEY
                         (repulsed)
                    Oh my God!
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Sorry.

     Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and
     continues applying make-up.

     Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.

                               WAYNE
                    So we got a deal. Four deputies---

                               WURLITZER
                    And me.

                               WAYNE
                    Why don't we make it three deputies and
                    you?

                               WURLITZER
                    Why don't I have Mickey thrown back
                    into his cell and we can forget the
                    whole thing?

                               WAYNE
                    Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and
                    you, I can live with that. We're about
                    ready to go here, so let's get rid of
                    these other assholes.

                               WURLITZER
                    Don't call my men assholes.

                               WAYNE
                    I didn't mean they were assholes. I
                    mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta
                    here.

     Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up
     a light stand.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of
                    these assholes. Now I want to create
                    the illusion that this is just Mickey
                    and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.
                    So make sure you don't film these
                    assholes. I don't want to see 'em on
                    film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'
                    slated our spot as human interest which
                    means we'll go live at just after
                    five-thirty.

     Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G.

     Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    This asshole's tryin' to tell me what
                    I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!
                    This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's
                    dealin' with here, but we do. And if
                    shit happens, he ain't gonna be
                    responsible, we are. So keep your
                    shotguns out, your fingers on the
                    triggers, and be ready to fire at a
                    moment's notice.

     BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a
     donut. He takes a big bite.

                               ROGER
                    Say something.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    What?

                               ROGER
                    Anything.

     Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.

                               MICKEY
                         (talking in rhyme)
                    I stand amid the roar
                    Of a surf tormented shore,
                    As I hold within my hand
                    Grains of the golden sand--
                    How few! yet how they creep
                    Through my fingers to the deep,
                    While I weep--while I weep!
                    O God! can I not save
                    One from the pitiless wave?
                    Is all that we see or seem
                    But a dream within a dream?

     Mickey bites into the donut.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    How was that?

     Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.

                               ROGER
                    Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment
                    here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n
                    roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the
                    donut place put a chocolate cream
                    filled I asked for in your box.

                               MICKEY
                    There's a chocolate cream filled in
                    there?

                               ROGER
                    Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

                               MICKEY
                    Tough titty, it's mine now.

                               ROGER
                    Look, I'll trade you.

     Wayne enters frame.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!
                    What did I tell you. Stop bothering
                    Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

                               ROGER
                         (to himself)
                    Fine. Roger, what the hell are you
                    doing? You're bothering the serial
                    killer.

     Roger exits FRAME.

     Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Sorry about that.

                               MICKEY
                    Don't worry about it.

                               WAYNE
                    We're about ready to go here. Are you
                    ready?

                               MICKEY
                    Let's do it.

     Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay people! Let's start to settle
                    down here.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16mm - BLACK & WHITE

     SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of
     Mickey's eye.

     CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Are you comfortable?

     Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Roger?

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Rockin'!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Rollin'...and speed!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Slate it.

     CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into
     view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the
     FRAME.

                               WAYNE
                    So, Mickey, tell us what you do for
                    fun.

                               MICKEY
                    Aside from the obvious?

     Mickey breaks out laughing.

                               WAYNE
                         (not amused)
                    Yes. Aside from the obvious.

    Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, let me see now. What do I do for
                    fun?
                         (to people O.S.)
                    Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are
                    drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.
                         (to camera)
                    Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just
                    sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies
                    smokin' up a storm, and it's really
                    doin' it to me.

     A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights
     it. Deputy exits FRAME.

                               MICKEY
                    Much obliged. What do I do for fun?
                    Do you want to know what I do for fun
                    or what I did for fun?

                               WAYNE
                    What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun
                    for starters.

                               MICKEY
                    What I did for fun for starters.
                         (thinking)
                    Well, something I used to do...always
                    was a lot of fun...
                         (pause)
                    No, scratch that. Let me think of
                    something else. In fact, why don't we
                    come back to that question. Ask me
                    something else.

                               WAYNE
                    Do you miss Mallory?

                               MICKEY
                    Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my
                    wife. I haven't seen her in a long
                    time. What a stupid question.

                               WAYNE
                    Then was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was what worth it?

                               WAYNE
                    Was massacring all those people worth
                    being separated from your wife for the
                    rest of your life?

     Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you think up these questions or the
                    girl with no tongue?

                               WAYNE
                    No, Mickey, I can't let you get away
                    with that shit. Answer the question.
                    Was it worth it? You haven't seen,
                    heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.
                    Was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was an instant of purity worth a
                    lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

                               WAYNE
                    Excuse me, did you say an instant of
                    purity? What was the instant of
                    purity? The bodies you left behind on
                    your bloody trail?

                               MICKEY
                    That's only part of it. I mean, it's a
                    big, big, big part. But it's only the
                    chorus, it's not the whole song.

                               WAYNE
                         (passionately)
                    Please explain to me, Mickey, where's
                    the purity that you couldn't live
                    without in five year old Danny
                    Millhouse's blown off head? Where's
                    the purity in forty-eight people who
                    are no longer on this planet because
                    they met you and Mallory? What's so
                    fucking pure about that?

     CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes
     a slow drag off his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Where the purity comes into play---

     The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams.

     WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that
                    thought. Reload, quick!

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     We're back to COLOR 35mm.

     WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell.
     CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her
     face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to
     subside.

     All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Love is a hurtin' thang,
                    and it leaves a fiery sting.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Okay. Okay, we're up again.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Roll it. Save the slate.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16MM - BLACK & WHITE

     We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of
     film.

                               WAYNE
                    You just said an instant of purity was
                    preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't
                    understand. What's so pure about
                    forty-eight dead bodies?

                               MICKEY
                    You'll never understand. Me and you,
                    Wayne, we're not even the same species.
                    I used to be you...then I evolved.
                    From where you're standing, you're a
                    man. From where I'm standing, you're a
                    ape. I'm here...I'm right here...
                    and you...you're somewhere else, man.
                    You say why? I say why not?

                               WAYNE
                    Tell me about the purity.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughing)
                    It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and
                    a smoke only get you so far. You're
                    gonna have to do your job.

                               WAYNE
                         (laughs)
                    Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll
                    move on and come back later.

                               MICKEY
                    I'm sure we will.

                               WAYNE
                    Describe Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                    Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,
                    she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two
                    feet, two hands, ten fingers...

                               WAYNE
                    Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You
                    know what I mean. Describe Mallory.
                         (points at his head)
                    What's up here?
                         (points at his heart)
                    What's in here?

                               MICKEY
                    That's indescribable.

                               WAYNE
                    Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do
                    you feel about the fact that you're
                    never gonna see Mallory again?

                               MICKEY
                         (smiles)
                    Says who?

                               WAYNE
                    Says the United States of America.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughs)
                    When have they ever been right?

     The crew laughs (O.S.)

                               MICKEY
                    Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.
     His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.
     Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to
     Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't
     believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

                               MICKEY
                    ...one night I was asleep, and a noise
                    wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,
                    somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a
                    gun, so I go into the living room with
                    a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned
                    out to be nothing. God made the noise.
                    Who knows?

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (whispers)
                    How's it goin'?

                               WURLITZER
                         (whispers)
                    Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

     Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.

                               WURLITZER
                    What the hell happened to you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You should see the other bitch. What
                    time you got?

                               WURLITZER
                    Two-thirty. Shhh...

     CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of
     the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to
     Mickey's story.

                               MICKEY
                    But I came to the direction I need a
                    gun. Do, the next day I started off
                    early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a
                    gun shop and pick up a little home
                    protection. I walked into the place
                    and had never seen so many guns in all
                    my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the
                    this really nice sales guy comes up to
                    me. His name was Warren. I'll never
                    forget his name. He was really nice.
                    Anyway, Warren showed me all these
                    different models of guns. Magnums,
                    automatics, pistols, Walters. And I
                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a
                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon
                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew
                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.
                    It felt like it was a part of me. They
                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at
                    myself holding it, and looked so
                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.
                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
                    Turned my car around, drove to
                    Mallory's house, we took care of
                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,
                    and we were off.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     MEDIUM CU on Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The
                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,
                    they all missed the point of the story.
                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding
                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I
                    realized for the first time my one true
                    calling in life. I'm a natural born
                    killer.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, let's cut it.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

                               WAYNE
                         (to Scott)
                    Did ya get that?

     Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.

                               SCOTT
                    It's gonna be beautiful.

                               WAYNE
                    Super cool.
                         (to Mickey)
                    This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

                               MICKEY
                    I could go for a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm not running out and getting that
                    piece of shit a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                    Fine.
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Julie, why don't you make a food run?
                         (to the room)
                    What's around here?

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    There's an In and Out Burgers about a
                    block away on Olive. It's walking
                    distance.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.
                    I'll have a double double with cheese,
                    french fries, and a large Coke.

     Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then
     goes from person to person collecting their orders.

     Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

                               WURLITZER
                    Are you all set?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready
                    to roll.

                               WURLITZER
                    I assigned you Bingham and Washington
                    to go along.

     In B.G., Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah, we met. They're good men.

                               WURLITZER
                    They're real Goddamn good. They'll be
                    there for when ya need 'em. Where
                    are they?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Waitin' in the lounge.

                               WURLITZER
                    How 'bout Mallory?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

     Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In
     the B.G., we hear the wall phone BUZZ.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

                               WURLITZER
                    Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

     Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    Capt'n!

                               WURLITZER
                    Yeah?

     The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    They need you. Emergency!

     Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into phone)
                    Talk to me.
                         (pause)
                    Where?
                         (pause)
                    For the love of Pete...okay...okay
                    ...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on
                    my way.

     CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious
     eavesdroppers.

     CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,
     Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's
     conversation.

     OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a
                    riot going on in the laundry room.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Is it serious?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    It sure as hell is. They got guns,
                    hostages, and explosives.

     The room reacts.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Jack, could you stay up here for a
                    while?

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Yeah, sure.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'm taking one of these men. Yates,
                    come with me.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Could we go with you and film it?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Stay up here and finish your interview,
                    I've got to see what the hell's going
                    on down there before I can take
                    responsibility for you to film there.

     We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.

     Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her
     notebook.

                               MICKEY
                    I'll have a four by four. That's four
                    patty burgers. Now they don't have
                    that on the menu, but if you order a
                    four by four, they'll know what you're
                    talking about. A large Coke and two
                    orders of fries.

     When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off
     silently.

     CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

     As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the
     CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the
     DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall
     masques with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds
     of a riot swell until...

     A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a
     MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

     The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before
     moving on.

     CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling
     across the floor.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Sure.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty
                    funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now
                    in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.
                    And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks
                    her mother if she can go out on a date.

     As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's
     CAMERA follows.

                               MICKEY
                    The mother asks, 'Where's he taking
                    you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in
                    movie.' The mother tells her she can
                    only go if she takes Little Johnny with
                    her. She says okay. They go to the
                    drive-in, they come back. The mother
                    gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,
                    what happened? Where did ya go?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
     like he's driving.

                               MICKEY
                    Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What
                    did they do?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

                               MICKEY
                    'They kissed. What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.

                               MICKEY
                    'He felt her up? What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

                               MICKEY
                         (dumbfounded)
                    'They took off their clothes? What
                    else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.

                               MICKEY
                    'They did it? What were you doing?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking
     off.

     Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,
     even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

     As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4
     during the punchline.

     While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy
     #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from
     Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with
     the butt.

     Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

     Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     The other deputies react.

     Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in
     the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with
     a THUD.

     Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching
     position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

     Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

     The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him
     out of FRAME.

     Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --
     SLOW MOTION.

     CU of ceiling being BLASTED.

     Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.

     Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to
     fire -- SLOW MOTION.

     Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti --
     SLOW MOTION.

     Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.

     Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

     They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of
     the room.

     Nobody fires.

     We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on
     the ground, scared to death.

     CU on Scagnetti's face.

     CU on Mickey's face.

     CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then
     CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

     OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into
     a CU on his face.

                               MICKEY
                    Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Slide the shotgun over here, put your
                    hands behind your head, put your
                    forehead on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow
                    you in half and you know it.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I've never wounded anything in my life.
                    I got you locked right between the eyes.

     Mickey rises.

                               MICKEY
                    If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'
                    you in half on three. So, if you got
                    me locked, take the shot. One...

     DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in F.G., past the gun, to his face.

     CU of barrel of shotgun.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Two...

     DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.

     Wayne watches, wide eyed.

     ECU on Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                    Three!

     MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold it! Don't shoot!

     He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up.

                               MICKEY
                    Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

     Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.

     The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet -- SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Toss it.

     Scagnetti does.

                               MICKEY
                    Now put your hands behind your head.

     Scagnetti does.

     Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand,
     facing each other.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What?

     Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti
     hits the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.

     Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys stay on your bellies.

                               ROGER
                    Yes, sir.

     Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.

                               MICKEY
                    I am the most dangerous man in the
                    world.

     Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.

     Scagnetti screams.

     Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY
                         (points at Scagnetti)
                    You're the law.
                         (points at himself)
                    I'm the law breaker.

     Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.

     Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.

                               MICKEY
                    Donut, get your camera. See if it's
                    broke.

                               WAYNE
                    Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

                               MICKEY
                    Scott's dead. And unless you wanna
                    play follow the leader, shut up and do
                    as you're told.


     Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds
     like a lawn mower.

                               MICKEY
                    How is it?

                               ROGER
                    Not good.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you have a back up.

                               ROGER
                    It's video.

                               MICKEY
                    Even better. Wayne call your station,
                    tell 'em we're going live a little
                    early today. Make it happen!

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a
     TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only
     see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the
     FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us.

                               WURLITZER
                    I want two men stationed in that tier,
                    and I want men with rifles all along
                    the walkway.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Capt'n!

     Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the layout of the laundry room.

                               WURLITZER
                    Where do the air ducts lead?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Problem is they'll hear somebody
                    approaching that way.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    We turned off the power when they took
                    over the room.

                               WURLITZER
                    We turn it back on. The machines go
                    back on supplying us with the cover
                    noise we need. Smithy, do it.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Right away, Capt'n.

     CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    Yes.

                               WURLITZER
                    You sure?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    I think--

                               WURLITZER
                    Never say you think when you know, or
                    you know when you think.

     Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Bergman, you in place?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Pass this to your team...the second
                    they get a lock on a blue, they're to
                    take the shot. Do you understand?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks to his right.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you think, Pitney? How much
                    Explosives do you think that they
                    really have in there?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    It's hard to say Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Take a wild stab!

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

                               WURLITZER
                    The entire wing?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    That's my opinion.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jesus...

     while adjusting his earphone.

                               CHAVEZ

                    can tell from the bloody carnage behind
                    me that the final chapter in the book
                    called Mickey and Mallory has not yet
                    been written.

     Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.

                               MICKEY
                    Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie
                    just underwent a title change. It's
                    now called 'The Escape of Mickey and

                    Okay, Donut, move in for a close up. I
                    want this for prosperity.

     CAMERA ZOOMS into a CU of Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin'

                    Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have
                    just tuned in, it appears that a
                    hostage situation involving Mickey Knox
                    is developing presently at the Los
                    Angeles County Jail. We have seen that
                    he is armed and apparently there has
                    been some loss of life. We will try to
                    re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle
                    and bring you more on this late
                    breaking story. Please stay tuned.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

     WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and
     grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go
     of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it
     loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off
     the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

     Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and
     slips it into his pants.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.
                    Stand behind me, put your back against
                    mine and extend your arms behind you.

     Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against
     Mickey's.

                               MICKEY
                    Now if I feel your back move away from
                    mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
                    Got it?

     Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Wayne, step forward.

     Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus
                    against the barrel.

     Wayne does.

                               MICKEY
                    Grab his arms.

     Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with
     gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

                               MICKEY
                    Either one of you two move, it's gonna
                    be shotgun city. You understand?

                               WAYNE & SCAGNETTI
                    Yes.

     Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

                               MICKEY
                    You ready, Donut?

                               ROGER
                    Ready.

                               MICKEY
                    Wagons, hooaaa!

     The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with
     the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's
     walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to
     his neck.

     Roger follows with the camera.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to

                    dodaleedo, do

     The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey,
     Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up
     along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped
     with tape.

     CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.

                    Honey, I'm home.

     Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This
     kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something
     everybody told them they would never do again.

     For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're
     enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.

                    in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,
                    another TV guy, that cop fella, and two
                    other deputies as hostages. And
                    Capt'n, they have one of them news
                    cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't
                    stop playin' it. What do you want us
                    to do?

     Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his
     mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing
     would come out. He just sits.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against
     the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly
     as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken
     fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is
     standing, alert and ready for action.

     As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,
     tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is
     panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man.

     Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, we're going out that door, and
                    we're gonna march down the hall and
                    right out of the building.
                         (to Wayne)
                    Donut said something about a news van.

                               WAYNE
                    Yeah, we have a van.

                               MICKEY
                    Where's it parked?

                               WAYNE
                    Out front.

                               MICKEY
                    Let me have the keys.

     Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses
     the keys to Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

                               MICKEY
                    No.

                               WAYNE
                    This is crazy. You can't escape like
                    this.

                               MICKEY
                    Probably not, but we're gonna give it
                    the old college try.

                               WAYNE
                    We'll all be killed.

                               MALLORY
                    Exciting, isn't it?

     Duncan begins to cry.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, when we get out there, you do what
                    we say or it's curtains. If we say
                    move, you move. If we say left, you
                    move left. If we say right, you move
                    right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.
                    Got it?

                               MALLORY
                    Are we in a big hurry?

                               MICKEY
                    You got something you want to do?

                               MALLORY
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    By all means, knock yourself out.

                               MALLORY
                    Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

     Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

     VIDEO FOOTAGE:

     Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she
     points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

                               MALLORY
                    You! Stand up!

     Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the
     wrong woman.

     Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

                               MALLORY
                    You probably thought it was pretty
                    funny, didn't ya?

     She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.
     Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

                               MALLORY
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked with me? Close your eyes and
                    remember...Are ya thinking about it?
                    Good.

     Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

     Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger
     HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

                               DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

                               MICKEY
                    We're sending out a hostage. Don't
                    touch him!

     OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

     Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory
     jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using
     the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell
     and...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

     There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

     CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the
     caravan.

     The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,
     real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

     The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,
     and gunfire.

     HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

     The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

     Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees
     this and screams.

                               MALLORY
                    Mickey!

                               MICKEY
                    Don't stop!

     Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Man, oh, man...this is better than
                    Vietnam!

     More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

     Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using
     DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.
     Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

                               DUNCAN
                    Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.
     The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

     Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
     control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

     CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls
     into FRAME screaming.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Get the camera! Get the fucking
                    camera!

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from
     Roger's side.

     The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last
     hostage.

     Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
     and silent.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    This way.

     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan
     the remaining hostage deputy.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Duncan)
                    Where does this lead?

     Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to
     wall.

                               MICKEY
                    Where!?!

                               DUNCAN
                    Th-- the ground floor.

                               MALLORY
                    Is that the front door?

     Duncan nods frantically.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's go.

     Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the
     stairs. They go down a few flights.

     As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team
     of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies
     raise their guns.

     Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand
     pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other
     are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

                               MALLORY
                    Back off or I'll blast him! Back off
                    or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll
                    blast him!

     None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
     likely to start shooting.

     Wayne screams.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!
                    Please, please, please...

     Wayne continues begging.

     Wurlitzer steps forward.

                               WURLITZER
                    Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

                               MALLORY
                    Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna
                    hear it!

                               WURLITZER
                    You have to know---

                               MALLORY
                    I said shut up...

     Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him
     in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

     Wayne's screaming in pain.

     The deputies jump back.

                               MALLORY
                    ...and I mean shut up!

     There's a bit of a silent standoff.

     Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly
     retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

     The deputies hold their present position.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory
     let their two hostages sit down.

     Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his
     uniform.

     Mickey's pacing.

                               MICKEY
                    Think...think...think...

     Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her
     hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's
     been shot.

     Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling
     from below.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Give up! There's no other way out!

     Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.
     him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

                               MALLORY
                    Look, lover boy, we're not getting
                    outta here. So I say the hell with
                    going back to our cells. Let's do a
                    Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
                    Run down these stairs shootin', go out
                    in a hail of bullets, but take as many
                    of those motherfuckers with us as
                    possible.

     Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

                               MICKEY
                    We'll do that when all else fails.

     Mickey stands.

                               MALLORY
                    Hasn't it?

                               MICKEY
                    We still got a few tricks up our
                    sleeves.

     Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You married?

                               DUNCAN
                    Oh, I don't wanna die...

                               MICKEY
                    Are you married? Do you have kids?

     Duncan nods pathetically.

                               MICKEY
                    Good. People, we're goin' all the way
                    to the front door. Now, the only way
                    we're gonna get there is if they don't
                    want to kill you two more than they
                    want to kill us.

     INSERT:

     SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill
     Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Right now I find that highly unlikely.
                    So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

     BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:

     Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, say I tell those guys down there
                    if they shoot or make a move, I'm
                    killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or
                    make a move anyway. Now say by some
                    freak accident, you didn't die, you
                    live though it. What would you do?

     Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts
     tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    What would I do? Me and my network
                    would sue the entire Los Angeles County
                    Sheriffs Department for flagrantly
                    disregarding my safety. I'd go
                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and
                    make sure everyone of those son of a
                    bitches down there ends up on the
                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue
                    every man down there personally. I
                    would make it my life's ambition to
                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.
                    I would do expose after expose on the
                    brutality, and the conditions, and the
                    inhumanity that exists here.

     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.
     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
     around the barrel of his shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    That's what I thought. You tell them
                    that. When we go down those stairs, I
                    want you to scream what you just told
                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the
                    star of American Maniacs watched every
                    week by'-- how many people?

                               WAYNE
                    On average forty million.

                               MICKEY
                    'Every week by forty million people. I
                    am a respected journalist.' Have you
                    won any awards?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The
                    Edward R. Murrow award...

                               MICKEY
                    'Respected journalist'-- On your
                    knees...

     Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props
     his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the
     barrel around his neck.

                               MICKEY
                         (continues)
                    ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the
                    Edward R. Murrow award among others.'
                    Tell 'em the name of your personal
                    lawyer, his firm, his address, and
                    phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor
                    and the unemployment lines. You
                    getting the idea?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

     Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the
     stock of the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Say it. Scream it. All the way out
                    the front door and into your van. And
                    if you stop screaming, I swear to God
                    I'll blow your head off.

                               WAYNE
                    Got it.

     Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before
     shouting to Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You! What's your name?

     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory
     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before
     reading his name badge.

                               MALLORY
                    Duncan...Homolka?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

     Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when
     they hear:

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Start.

     Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

     The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they
     take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would
     die.

     Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
     shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in
     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he
     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE
     and COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA
     on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be
     spared.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star
                    of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty
                    million people every week! I am a
                    respected journalist, winners of the
                    Golden Globe, the Edward R.
                    Murrows Award among others! If anybody
                    puts me in danger, my network will sue
                    The Los Angeles County Sheriffs
                    Department. My estate will sue every
                    officer personally who fires. The
                    network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis
                    and Sinclair...

     Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the
     deputies.

                               MALLORY
                         (yelling)
                    Make a path!

     The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

     The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne
     yelling all the way.

     The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they
     keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front
     lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

     Wurlitzer stands his ground.

                               WURLITZER
                    How far do you think your gonna get?

                               MICKEY
                    Right out the front door.

                               WURLITZER
                    That'll never happen.

                               MICKEY
                    It is happening.

     The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep
     their weapons ready.

     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

                               MALLORY
                    Don't stop!

     Wayne starts up again.

     The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer
     are nose to nose.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Mickey)
                    I will personally hunt you down, blow
                    the head off your fucking-whore-wife,
                    and plant your sick ass in the ground
                    all by myself.

                               MICKEY
                         (calmly)
                    Another day perhaps, but not today.

     Mickey leaves FRAME.

                                                    CUT TO:

     EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,
     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open
     air.

     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while
     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE
     LEADER.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &
     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being
     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a
     fence post.

     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not
     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly
     into the CAMERA.

                               WAYNE
                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and
                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are
                    shooting with a wild camera and a
                    standard recorder we found in the van.
                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked
                    out the front door, into my news van
                    and made our getaway. When we were
                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox
                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
                    and tossed his body out of the back.
                    Mickey told authorities over my police
                    band that I would surely be next if
                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They
                    took Mickey at his word and called off
                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
                    employed, I don't know. My only
                    thought is it all happened too fast for
                    arrangements to be made. We've just
                    pulled off to the side of the road to
                    do this interview. Tensions run high--

     Mickey screams O.S.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!

                               WAYNE
                    Without any further ado, Mickey and
                    Mallory...

     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting
     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces
     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's
                    plan? Did you think it would work?

                               MALLORY
                    It wasn't 'till we got on the ground
                    floor that I totally realized they
                    weren't gonna shoot unless we shot
                    first. When we got out of the
                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my
                    God. This might work.' But
                    Mickey knew it would work all along.
                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.
                    It's not like there was and he just
                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    What did you think then?

                               MALLORY
                    I wondered how long it would be before
                    we'd get to be alone together. And I
                    wondered if I could wait that long.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you have anything to do with the
                    riot in the laundry room?

                               MALLORY
                    Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'
                    word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can
                    I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Try to keep it to a minimum.

                               MALLORY
                    We had nothing to do with that riot.
                    That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

     Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

                              MICKEY
                    Divine intervention.

                               MALLORY
                    What he said. We didn't know jack shit
                    about and riot. It just happened. It
                    was kismet. We didn't even know those
                    people. How are we supposed to
                    organize a riot when we've been in
                    fuckin' isolation for the past year?
                    Just bleep out the fucks and jack
                    shits.
                         (laughs)
                    I mean, it's not like we care. If they
                    wanna say we masterminded the whole
                    thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep
                    us up at night. But you said you
                    wanted the truth, and the truth is we
                    were just lucky.

     Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

                               MICKEY
                    C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    So, what now?

                               MALLORY
                    Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take
                    it easy. Just enjoy each other's
                    company, stop and smell the roses,
                    notice the color purple, stuff like
                    that.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    How do you intend to disappear? you're
                    probably the most famous couple in
                    America.

                               MALLORY
                    Well, back in slave times they had a
                    thing called the underground railroad.
                    And we got a whole fan club out there
                    just waiting to be conductors.
                         (to the camera)
                    So, you kids out there, keep the faith.
                    Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'
                    to your town real soon.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, that's enough. End of interview.
                    We gotta move.

     Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
     lowers it from his eye.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay, just let me swing around and film
                    myself asking the questions. And then
                    I'll do my little wrap up.

     Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
     balances it on a fence post.

                               MICKEY
                    Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,
                    all right. But it won't be you starin'
                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting
                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be
                    starin' down the barrels of our
                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the
                    triggers.

     Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into
     a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    That's a joke right?

     Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her
     shotgun from off the ground.

                               WAYNE
                    Just wait one fucking minute.

                               MICKEY
                    I said I'd give you a interview. Now
                    unless I'm mistaken, we just did a
                    interview.
                         (to Mallory)
                    We did an interview, didn't we?

                               MALLORY
                    Looked like an interview to me.

                               MICKEY
                    I said we'd give you an interview. I
                    never said we wouldn't kill you.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt
                    during this...this whole escape that
                    a kind of bond--

     Wayne is shaking.

                               WAYNE
                         (continues)
                    ...developed between the three of
                    us. We're kindda in this together,
                    don't ya think?

                               MICKEY
                    No. Not really.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't touch those triggers! Please. I
                    think I've already proven that a live
                    Wayne Gayle is much more better that a
                    dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your
                    passport out of jail, not Duncan
                    Homolka. But me! I'll be your
                    passport outta---

                               MICKEY
                    Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate
                    you. If anybody in the fuckin' world
                    deserves to die, it's you.

     Wayne is grasping for anything.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and
                    Mallory always leave somebody alive to
                    tell the tale.

                               MICKEY
                    We are.
                         (points to camera)
                    Your camera.

     Mickey turns to Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                         (John Wayne voice)
                    Let's make a little music, Colorada.

                               WAYNE
                    NO!!!

     The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,
     who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

     Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing
     into the news van, they drive away.

     Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA
     eventually runs out of film.

ELECTRONICS STORE -- CONTINUOUS Multiple images of Josie play across rows of TV sets. A crowd has gathered. JOSIE (V.O.) It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was just trying to do my job. And then things happened. Well, life happened. And now I'm here. EXTERIOR. BASEBALL STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS The clock starts to tick down. The crowd yells again. JOSIE (V.O.) Trust me. I am not the kind of girl who does things like this. I mean, two months ago you couldn't have picked me out of a crowd... INTERIOR. CHICAGO SUN TIMES BULLPEN -- DAY Packed with office workers. Bustling with activity. The camera searches the crowd. JOSIE (V.O.) Told you. I'm over there. The camera swings to Josie entering. Rhoda, a young copy assistant, tails her, pen and paper in hand. RHODA Theater-- JOSIE Standard American calls for "er". Standard British is "re". So go for "er", unless you're a pompous American, then go for British. Josie keeps negotiating the maze, leaving Rhoda in her wake. RHODA No. Theater. Last night. We were supposed to go, remember? Josie stops at a desk where Merkin Burns, officious office assistant, is talking on the phone. He picks his nose with abandon as he talks, ignoring Josie. MERKIN (into phone) No way. No way. No way. Ech, hold on. (to Josie) What. JOSIE Messages? Merkin removes his finger from his nose and uses it to pick up a pink message. He holds it out to Josie. Disgusted, she takes it by one corner. MERKIN (into phone) Seriously? No way. No way-- Josie's still standing there. MERKIN What JOSIE Merkin, do you think we could get some more yellow highlighters? I checked the box and we're-- Merkin swivels his chair 180 degrees so his back is to Josie and continues with his phone call. MERKIN (back into phone) Okay, I'm back, so-- Josie sighs, walks to her door. It's marked with a lopsided nameplate: Josie Geller, Copy Editor. She adjusts the plate so it's perfectly straight. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS Josie enters, reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers, and drops it into the trash can. She hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door, takes five pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in her pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a row. She smiles, satisfied, ready for another day. Anita Brandt, late 20's, pretty in a semi-unprofessional way, bursts in, smiling. ANITA Guess who I did it with last night... JOSIE (duh) Roger in Op/Ed. ANITA Who told! JOSIE You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him." ANITA Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure. Josie just stares at her. ANITA Once it didn't happen for sure. Gus Strauss, late 30's, would probably clean up well, enters. He tosses some copy onto Josie's desk. GUS Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess. JOSIE (emphasizing) It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings. Gus and Anita just stare at Josie. JOSIE Well, excuse me for caring about words. GUS (to Anita) So. You and Roger in Op/Ed. ANITA Oh, man! Who told? GUS Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating. JOSIE Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex. ANITA And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can? Anita flounces off. GUS How many times have I fired her? JOSIE Five-- Six-- GUS (shrugging, giving up) Eh. Gus turns to exit. JOSIE Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk? GUS Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it. JOSIE (disappointed) Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good. GUS Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter. JOSIE You've done five of my ideas. GUS You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters? JOSIE They don't have to be in the office Christmas show? GUS A flack jacket. JOSIE (not getting it) A--flack jacket. GUS Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls. JOSIE You don't think I can grab bulls' balls? GUS Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five. JOSIE Hey--I can be out of control. Gus smiles. On his way out he re-adjusts Josie's nameplate so it hangs at an angle. Tormented, Josie waits a beat. She can't take it, and runs to the door and straightens it. GUS (over his shoulder) Copy by five. INTERIOR. SUN TIMES LUNCHROOM -- DAY Actually, a pretty depressing kitchenette area. Anita and Josie eat lunch--Anita eats Chinese out of a container, Josie has three baggies of perfectly cut food in front of her. JOSIE Be honest. Do you think I'm aggressive? Anita ponders a moment. ANITA Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it? JOSIE Yeah. ANITA You stood for like a month. Cynthia, an affable African-American woman in her 40's, enters and puts three microwave meals in the microwave. JOSIE Just because I'm not out of control doesn't mean I can't write. CYNTHIA Josie, you listen to me. If you feel you're a writer--(touching her chest) Here, deep inside, don't let anyone tell you you're not. Look at me. Every day I come to this paper and I pour my heart and soul into what I do. I feel it, passionately, to the core of my being. JOSIE You write obituaries. CYNTHIA Hey, if you can make a busted aorta sound good--honey, that's art. The microwave dings off. Cynthia fishes the three Lean Cuisines out. Anita and Josie share a look. ANITA Cynthia, aren't they only diatetic if you eat them one at a time? CYNTHIA I eat 'em one at a time. ANITA (to Josie) Y'know, maybe Gus has a point. It wouldn't kill you to relax and have some fun. Roger's got a friend, Marshall in editing? The one with the lazy eye? Maybe we could double date. JOSIE Forget it. ANITA I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date? JOSIE I'm concentrating on my career right now. ANITA Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?! JOSIE (embarrassed) Anita! ANITA Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy (beat) If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye. Josie laughs in spite of herself. JOSIE The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him. ANITA Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion. JOSIE When I finally get kissed, I'll know. Anita and Cynthia trade looks. ANITA Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear. JOSIE I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing-- CYNTHIA "That thing"? Is that what you kids are calling it these days? JOSIE That thing. That moment. You kiss someone and it's like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this other person and you know that one person is the person you're meant to be kissing for the rest of your life. And for that one moment you've been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry at the same time because you're so lucky you found it, and so scared that it will all go away. Anita and Cynthia take this in. CYNTHIA Damn, girl. You are a writer. INTERIOR. TIKI POST -- DAY Basically a Mailbox Etc. store, but dressed in a Tahitian theme. Cardboard hula dancers hold Fedex envelopes. Rob Geller, 23, good-looking, wears a smock with "Tiki Post" emblazoned across it over a Hawaiian shirt. He stands watch at the cash register. Monty Maylik, 50, proud owner, rearranges a display. The place is empty. ROB Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today? MONTY (of course) I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think? ROB I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches. MONTY Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up! ROB I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time. Josie walks into the store, triggering Hawaiian music. Monty puts a lei over her head. MONTY Aloha! Welcome! ROB Relax, Monty. It's just my sister. Monty takes the lei off her neck. Josie hands Rob an envelope. Rob rifles through the cash inside. ROB Thanks, Jos. I'll pay you back. Bambi thanks you, too. Rob indicates a beat-up wreck of a yellow car parked outside. JOSIE That is so--weird that you name your car. ROB No it's not. Guys name their penises. JOSIE Okaaaay....(then) That car's going to bankrupt you. ROB She just needs a new windshield wiper. JOSIE Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do. Rob hands the money back. ROB Y'know what? Take it. I don't want it. Josie hands it back. JOSIE Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal. ROB No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list. JOSIE Better person than I. ROB See! JOSIE I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and-- ROB I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life. JOSIE (whispering) This--this is a luau that sells packing material! ROB Someday this luau is going to be all mine! JOSIE How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills? ROB Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you! JOSIE For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life! She exits. The music starts up again. MONTY Come again! INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT We pan around the neatest and quietest walk-up you've ever seen. Lots of books on shelves. We find Josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow. She turns it over and we see it says: "LOVE". She holds up the final product to a terrarium, lookup up at her two turtles. JOSIE There. What d'you think, guys? Where should it go? Josie looks around the living room. JOSIE Hmm. (She pretends to listen to the turtles.) What's that? Bedroom? Great idea! She walks into the bedroom with the pillow. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS A perfectly arranged Laura Ashley bedroom. We pan over to the bed. It is completely covered in needlepoint pillows. Josie places the latest one on top of the others and smiles. JOSIE Perfect. INTERIOR. A CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME It's packed with the NEWSPAPER STAFF. Hyram Rigfort, 65, white-haired, dignified owner of the paper presides. Anita and Josie sit next to each other. Next to Anita sits Roger from Op/Ed, a good-looking guy in his 30's. RIGFORT Let me start out by saying that I was very impressed by the investigative piece Dutton did on pesticides in our supermarkets. An older man, Dutton, smiles proudly. RIGFORT But since the Trib did a better piece on the same subject, you're fired. Dutton's face falls. Everyone looks horrified. RIGFORT You heard me. Out. Out. Dutton shuffles out. Josie takes a big bite of donut. RIGFORT So. Happy March everybody! ALL (by rote) Happy March Mr. Rigfort. RIGFORT To celebrate, I've decided it's time for another undercover feature! Everyone looks underwhelmed. RIGFORT You all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience. Who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last month's award-winning expose -- "hair today, gone tomorrow"? Hat's off to you, Bruns. We pan over to Bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in odd-looking clumps. He nods sadly. RIGFORT Or should I say "hat's on"! And what about when my wife had that affair with Gil, her ski instructor and Howard went undercover as an expert slalom skier. Howard smiled wanly. Both his arms are in casts. Camera pans the room as Rigfort continues, picking out different reporters. RIGFORT So last night I'm sitting around the dinner table with my family. The wife, the two nannies, the boys, and we're eating chicken with this peanut sauce. Camera stops at a Chef Boyardee look-alike. GUS Undercover chef. I like it. RIGFORT Hang on, Gus. So, we're eating this peanut sauce and suddenly the younger kid starts choking. Camera stops at a Nurse Ratchet look-alike. ANITA (sotto to Josie) I'm smelling undercover ER nurse. RIGFORT Turns out he's allergic to peanuts. And I think -- holy shit. I don't even know my own kids. I mean, who knows if they're even mine? And it got me thinking. How much do we know about kids today? What are they thinking? How many of them are allergic to peanuts? Boom. It hit me -- "My Semester In High School." Camera stops at a bald guy, the jerks over one seat to Josie. RIGFORT (to Josie) You. What's your name. JOSIE Josie. Josie Geller. RIGFORT You enroll on Friday. General crowd hubub. Josie's in shock. JOSIE Oh. But--I'm not a reporter yet... RIGFORT And none of these geezers could pass for a day under 40. Have fun. And Rigfort exits. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER Josie is so excited she can hardly speak to Anita. JOSIE It's finally happening, Anita! I'm going to write! Anita looks concerned. JOSIE My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller". ANITA Jos - Maybe you should turn it down. A beat. Josie's face falls. JOSIE You don't think I can do it. ANITA No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin! Gus enters. GUS Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out. JOSIE But I don't want it straightened out. GUS Geller, this is way out of your league. Josie takes in Anita and Gus. JOSIE Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this. ANITA Jos, that's not what we're -- JOSIE Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs? Anita looks down, chastened. ANITA Senorita Josie. JOSIE And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles? GUS (sotto) You did. ANITA (to Gus) You knit? JOSIE So, this is my chance. A beat. GUS I'm not holding your job for you, Geller. Josie jumps up and down and hugs Gus, who is clearly uncomfortable. GUS Don't make me send you the memo on hugging in the workplace. Josie smiles. Gus exits. ANITA I do believe in you, Jos. Anything you need, I'll help you out. Josie sits, motions to the brown paper bag. JOSIE You can start by handing me that bag. Anita does. Josie sticks it over her face, flips her head between her knees and starts hyperventilating again. Close up on Rob, wearing his Tiki Post outfit. He shakes his head. ROB No. Uh, uh. Pull out to reveal him standing with Josie on the sidewalk in front of - EXTERIOR. TIKI POST - DAY Josie's shiny Buick is parked right behind Bambi at the curb. JOSIE It's just for a couple of months. ROB You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life! JOSIE I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre. Rob rolls his eyes and enters the store. JOSIE You can name it whatever you want. INTERIOR. TIKI POST - CONTINUOUS Josie follows Rob into the store. He turns. ROB Wow. This must be big. JOSIE I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school. Rob starts laughing uncontrollably. JOSIE What!? ROB Do you remember high school? JOSIE It was a long time ago - ROB Don't you remember what they called you? Slowly Josie's face falls. She looks very far away. ROB Josie - INTERIOR. A HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY (FLASHBACK) It's packed with kids. Everyone stares off-screen at chants - ALL Josie Grossie. Josie Grossie. Josie Grossie. INTERIOR. TIKI POST - SAME Josie looks stricken. JOSIE Josie Grossie. ROB I know. I came up with it. (beat) You look nauseous. JOSIE Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God. She puts her hand over her mouth, races for the bathroom. INTERIOR. TIKI POST BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER Josie has just gotten violently ill. She rises off her knees, grabs some toilet paper to wipe her mouth. She looks down at her feet. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY (FLASHBACK) We close up on brown leather oxfords and widen to reveal teenage JOSIE braces, heavy glasses, in all her nerdom, slowly walking down the corridor with a huge backpack on her back. A boy sneaks up behind her, holds open the top of her backpack while another boy pours a half drunk Sprite into her backback. Kids smile and snicker as Josie continues down the hallway. She spots, Billy Prince, ultmate high school heartthrob, and approaches him nervously. JOSIE Hey, Billy Prince, I noticed you weren't in math today, and I have the notes in case you want - Midway through Josie's speech, we hear the odd sound of liquid hitting linoleum. Josie follow Billy's gaze down to between her feet where a pool of Sprite has gathered. Billy starts to laugh. Kids around him join in. As the laughter echoes around her we DISSOLVE BACK TO: INTERIOR. TIKI POST BATHROOM - SAME (PRESENT DAY) Josie stares into the mirror. Staring back is teenage Josie. JOSIE This is a very bad idea. INTERIOR. THE MALL - TEEN CLOTHING STORE - DAY Anita and Josie cruise through a teen clothing store, carrying large bags from a stationery store. Josie picks up a platform sneaker and just stares at it. ANITA So, you were a geek. Big deal. JOSIE Anita, remember espadrilles? ANITA Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes. JOSIE The girls threw them at me in the locker room. ANITA Okay. That's bad. JOSIE At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool. ANITA Mama mia. (then) Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation. Anita pulls a slip skirt off a rack and holds it up. ANITA Now this is cute. JOSIE That is lingerie. ANITA So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one. JOSIE What'd you feel when you kissed him? ANITA Bridgework? JOSIE Very romantic. Josie pulls out a plain button-down cardigan. JOSIE How about this? ANITA I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady. Anita grabs an awful white maribou jacket and matching earrings and holds them up. ANITA Cuuuute! JOSIE 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing. ANITA And we're going to have to do something about your hair. JOSIE Anita! ANITA Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast! SMASH CUT TO: CLOSE UP - AN ALARM CLOCK on a bedside table. Surrounded by make-up, boxes of hair color, a stack of index cards, ripped magazine pages of teen looks, issues of Teen Beat and YM. The clock slips to 7:00. NPR starts playing. A hand reaches over, hits the radio off. SOUND EFFECTS: A school bell. As the bell continues to ring, we widen to: INTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING Josie sits up in bed, covers pulled up to her chin in terror. EXTERIOR. A CHICAGO STREET - MORNING MUSIC UP: "Morning Train". Crowds of commuters stream down the sidewalk and onto the stairs leading up to the El. A big yellow car jerks into frame, backfires noisily. It's Josie at the wheel of Bambi. She jerks out of frame. EXTERIOR. SOUTH GLEN SOUTH HIGH SCHOOOL - MORNING A suburban campus anchored by a main building. Cars pull into the parking lot for the beginning of the day. Kids greet each other, converge on the front doors of the school. General mayhem. Bambi pulls in. She jerks into a spot, backfiring once more for effect. The entire scene stops. Kids freeze, look at Josie. A beat, and they they continue on their way. INTERIOR. BAMBI - CONTINUOUS Josie takes a few deep breaths. JOSIE Okay, I can do this. Piece of cake. I can do this. EXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS Josie steps out of the car wearing the maribou jacket, earrings, and white jeans. She shuts the door behing her, starts walking. She has unknowingly shut her jacket in the door and as she walks, a piece of maribou rips, trailing behind her like a tail. JOSIE Yeah, okay. Feeling good... INTERIOR. SCHOOL LOBBY - SAME Josie merges with the throngs of kids and is literally pushed into the lobby. She stares around, overwhelmed. "Go Rams!" banners share space with signs that read: "63 DAYS TIL PROM!" She inches her way along the wall until she is stopped by a guard who grabs her arm. GUARD Hey--where are you going? JOSIE Oh, I'm a student. Most definitely a student. In high school. Here. I am going to class. With my fellow students. (greeting random kids) Hi. Hi there. The guard stares at her a beat and then motions behind them, to three huge metal detectors that the kids are filtering through. Josie smiles, "whoops," walks back. GUARD (under his breath) Freak. INTERIOR. SCHOOL LOBBY - MINUTES LATER Josie's stuff lays out on the post-detector table - cell phone, laptop, mini tape recorder, electronic organizer, pager, being scrutinized by the guard. Josie's sure she's been found out. Camera widens. Down from Josie, we see other kids' belongings spread out. They have the identical high-tech equipment. The guard picks up Josie's nail file, examines it - GUARD Weapon. And throws it in the trash. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING Josie stares at her class card and eyes the classrooms, totally lost. She approaches a boy in a flannel shirt and loose jeans. JOSIE Hi--um, I'm looking for Room 204, Ms. Knox? As soon as the boy starts to talk, we notice something in his mouth - a tongue pierce. Josie does too. We zoom in on that shiny little metal ball. Josie is fixated. So fixated that we stop hearing the boy's voice. All we see is the mouth - and that ball - moving. The mouth closes. He's done. Josie's face is contorted in imagined pain. JOSIE Ow. (catching herself) I mean, wow. Wow. Great directions. Clear. Concise. And Josie takes off, totally embarrassed. BOY (under his breath) Freak. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING Josie walks up to Room 204. Opening the door, she's met by a sea of faces. Ms. Knox, mid-forties, distracted but bubbly, sits in the front of the class. MS. KNOX Hi - hello. Wilkommen. Entre. Josie walks in. Kids whisper and snicker. JOSIE Sorry I'm late. MS. KNOX Yes, well, I'm sorry I forgot to take my hot flash medication this morning. Josie, right? Please sit. Mi casa es su casa. Josie makes her way to the desk, trailing maribou. The class titters. She sits in front of two girls, Kirsten and Kristen, beautiful and intimidating. KIRSTEN That is so sad -- KRISTEN I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid. MS. KNOX Josie, in my classroom, tardiness is unacceptable -- JOSIE I'm really sorry -- Ms. Knox pulls a ridiculously huge sombrero out from under her desk. The class laughs in recognition. MS. KNOX Not as sorry as I am. Ms. Knox puts the sombrero on a less-than-thrilled Josie. MS. KNOX Ole! Ten minutes in this hat, you'll never be late again. So, let's hear something about you. Stand up. Stand up. Josie does. The sombrero drops over her eyes. She adjusts it so she can read her notecards. CLOSE UP on the notecard --it's filled with precise script under a heading: MY PAST. She scans it, then flips the cards face-down on the desk. Confidently she begins -- JOSIE My name is Josie. I'm a high school student. I came from -- Just then the classroom door opens. We see from Josie's perspective a blinding light, Josie squints. From the light emerges a shadowy vision of Billy Prince. JOSIE Billy? Josie blinks, REVEAL not Billy, but a beautiful guy, Guy. He stands very close to her. JOSIE (catching herself) Bali. (another beat) I'm from Billy-Bali. It's a suburb of Bali proper. Guy pushes past her, tosses a wooden hall pass to Ms. Knox, and moves to his seat. MS. KNOX Bali. Fascinating! What did your family do there? Josie looks around in panic, sees a student in a South Glen South windbreaker with huge ram on the back. JOSIE We were--sheep--farmers. We raised sheep. In Billy-Bali. Josie realizes the trouble she's gotten herself into. JOSIE Oh my God. (caught) Oh my God--do I miss Billy-Bali. (beat) It had--a really great...aquarium. She sits. Defeated. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER Josie rushes down the hall, still toting her enormous bag. A huge banner - SOUTH GLEN, OUR NATION'S BEST PROM - hangs prominently. She talks covertly into a hand-held tape recorder. JOSIE Note to self--Research Bali. Kill Anita for picking out this outfit. Find and destroy sombrero. INTERIOR. CLASSROOM - SAME Josie and her enormous bookbag enter. She takes a seat toward the back of the room. Kristen, Kirsten and GIBBY, another beauty, enter and head to the back of the room. Kirsten and Gibby stand over Josie, staring at her. KIRSTEN We sit here. JOSIE Oh. Sorry--I didn't know these were assigned. GIBBY: They're not. Josie quickly gathers her things and moves one row forward, next to two empty seats. TWO STONERS shuffle over to Josie. STONER 1 Sorry. We sit here. JOSIE (indicating two empty seats) Couldn't you two--sit there? STONER 2 Right. Except there are three of us-- The Stoners eye each other, then the two seats. A look of horror comes over Stoner 1. STONER 1(cont'd) Dude--we left Jed at the 7-11! (beat) Again! Josie picks up her stuff, moves to the last empty seat in the room-in the front row, surrounded by "Denominators" who all wear orange Denominator sweatshirts. Sitting next to Josie is ALDYS, a Denominator--intense, wise, with a whole bunch of math medals on her sweatshirt. She smiles at Josie. Josie smiles back and looks up as MR. COULSON enters the room. He's a ruggedly handsome twenty-something Yale grad. He grabs a notebook out of his bag, goes around to sit on the front of his desk, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup. SAM Hi, everyone. (Spots Josie) I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam. JOSIE (shyly) I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie. Sam smiles. SAM Josie since you're new--I love to drink my coffee during class, and since I allow myself to do this, I allow everyone to bring beverages to class as well. (a beat) welcome to Shakespeare's "As You Like It." (beat) Okay. How many of you actually read the assignment last night? About five hands go up. SAM (contd) Not bad. Now how many of you spent more than thirty minutes eating salty snack foods? Twenty hands. Sam laughs. SAM (contd) Man. If I could just get you guys to read while you eat. Sam opens his book. Aldys notices Josie has no book. She moves next to her. ALDYS Here. We can share. They share a smile. SAM 'As You Like It" is an example of a Shakespearean-- Sam turns to the blackboard and starts writing. We CU on his butt, hardly discernable in his loose 501 jeans, all the girls swoon. SAM (contd) Pastoral Comedy. Anyone know what that means? An enthusiastic, if slightly dim girl, SERA, waves her hand. SERA Oh oh oh! That's what they do to milk! SAM That's pasteurize, Sera. But close. Same letter-- (tapping three fingers on his arm a la charades) --three syllables-- SERA Parakeet?! ALDYS: (sotto to Josie) There's a minute of my life I'll never get back. Josie smiles at this. SAM Okay, anyone else--- Josie can't contain herself. JOSIE Pastoral means set in the country. Originally seen in the Eclogues of Virgil. It's from the Latin pascere. To graze. Student bleets like a sheep O.S. Sam just stares at her, smiling. Finally, he walks over and shakes her hand. SAM Did I mention to the class that I love our new student? Josie beams. GIBBY Did I mention that the class also loves our new kiss ass? Josie's smile quickly fades. SAM Gibby, that's not exactly the kind of participation I'm looking for. Gibby looks right at Josie. GIBBY (totally insincere) Ooops. Sorry. Josie just sits there, face burning. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER Josie approaches her locker. She can't get to it because a COUPLE is busy making out against it. A GIRL'S VOICE comes over the loudspeaker. She's completely ignored. GIRL'S VOICE Hi. This is Sydney, Student Body President! Okay, first. Bad news-The' district didn't allocate enough funds, so as of this afternoon, there will be no music department. Now, about Prom-- The entire hallway FREEZES. The couple breaks their clinch and looks up. SILENCE. Josie is amazed. SYDNEYS VOICE Voting on Prom theme has been completed. And the theme is-- CU on expectant FACES. SYDNEYS VOICE (cont'd) The Millennium! PANDEMONIUM. Kids cheer, gasp. One GIRL faints. The crowd surges again. Josie, caught in the flow, doesn't notice a locker door flinging open. She smashes her face right into it. Everyone, including Guy, turns and laughs. Even some Denominators. CUT TO CU: A CAFETERIA TRAY Moves down the food line. It's piled with unidentifiable foods and three glasses of fluorescent red punch. Hands pull the tray out of the frame. INTO FRAME comes another tray, this one bearing a perfectly arranged place setting with three celery sticks on a plate. WIDEN TO REVEAL: INTERIOR. CAFETERIA - DAY Josie, pulling the perfect tray down the cafeteria line. She reaches some awful-looking Cole slaw in a big vat. A CAFETERIA GUY in a plastic cap hovers above it. JOSIE (to cafeteria guy) Excuse me. What's in the Cole slaw? The cafeteria guy hauls an industrial-size plastic tub onto the, counter and turns it-so Josie can read the label: "KOLE SLAW FOOD." Josie wrinkles her nose. She moves on to the cash register. CASHIER That'll be twelve ninety-five. JOSIE (stunned) Oh my gosh. Wow. That's... pricey. CASHIER That's real meat in the ham sandwich. Josie turns to a GIRL in line behind her. JOSIE Boy--that's a lot of bread for that bread! The Girl rolls her eyes, reaches past Josie to grab a mustard bottle. Josie turns with her tray toward the room. CUT TO INTERIOR. CAFETERIA - DAY (FLASHBACK) 4 KIDS stare at CAMERA and chant: ALL Josie Grossie--Josie Grossie--Josie Grossie. ANGLE BACK ON JOSIE. She's seventeen. Standing with her tray, paralyzed. The CAMERA SPINS, showing us her back. There, tattooed in squeeze-bottle mustard, is "GROSSIE." A boy stands behind her victoriously holding the mustard bottle. CUT BACK TO INTERIOR. CAFETERIA - SAME (PRESENT DAY) Josie shakes off the vision and stares out at the crowded cafeteria. She sees Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, steels herself, and decides to approach. Kirsten is eating a bran muffin. KRISTEN Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams. KIRSTEN Nah uh. GIBBY Yeah, I read this thing that one bran muffin can be like two bran muffins sometimes. Kirsten pushes the muffin away. KIRSTEN God. Food is so confusing. JOSIE (to Kirsten) Hi Kristen. KIRSTEN It's Kirsten. Josie plops herself down with these girls, and takes a spiral pad out of her big knapsack. In the process, she manages to spill her chocolate milk all over her white jeans. JOSIE That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day. GIBBY Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983. They all laugh. Josie fakes a laugh, too. JOSIE Right, right. Josie picks up her notepad and her pen. JOSIE So - tell me about yourselves. They all just stare at Josie in disgust. Guy approaches their table. GUY I'm Guy. Guy looks at Josie. He's beautiful. She's flustered. JOSIE Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed. (beat) Yikes. (beat) Bikes! GUY (very serious) Are you in special ed? Josie stands up, grabs her bag and her chocolate milk- JOSIE Bye. Guy. Others. She leaves the Cafeteria, passing a-couple of Denominators. JOSIE (to herself) Aaaah! How old am I? DENOMINATOR #1 Approximately six thousand three hundred and fifty days old- subject to adjustment for month of birth. This is very funny Denominator humor- to the Denominators. Josie leaves the Cafeteria. EXTERIOR. SCHOOL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS Josie runs out an exit door and right into a SECURITY GUARD GUARD You got a pass? INTERIOR. GYM - LATER A banner above reads "PRESIDENTIAL FITNESS TESTING THIS WEEK." FIFTEEN SENIOR GIRLS, including Josie, in matching green and yellow polyester gym clothes do sprints up and-down the basketball court. Josie looks like she's about to die. Ms. Brown yells as she passes. MS. BROWN move it Geller! Move it! Move it! Josie stops, grabs the woman by the shoulders. JOSIE Must--have--water-- MS. BROWN What do I look like, your waitress? Now you're gonna complete these sprints, cause if you don't you fail. And if you fail gym, you're NEVER GETTING INTO COLLEGE! JOSIE Oh--my--God--you guys arestill telling that lie--? MS. BROWN That's it Geller--drop and give me twenty! Josie drops to the gym floor. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER It's - finally- the end of the day. Josie makes her way down the hall, clutching her pad of paper, getting pushed and shoved by kids as they storm outside. A huge banner hangs overhead reading: "SIGN UP FOR SENIOR NIGHT!" She tries to smile at some kids, but they all ignore her. She makes it to the main entrance to the school, where we see, as she shoves her pad of paper into her bag, it is completely blank. EXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - SAME Kids fill the parking lot. Josie walks, talking on her cell phone. JOSIE (into phone) Rhoda, make sure Gus gets-the whole message, okay? Yeah--bye-- Josie arrives where she parked Bambi. The space is empty. She still holds the phone to her ear-- JOSIE Wait a second-- (into phone) No, not you--bye-- Josie shuts the phone, looks around...retraces her steps ... Bambi is gone. Josie walks around the lot, getting visibly upset. In the corner of the lot, we see a group of Denominators removing a BIG METAL CHAIN from around a group of tightly packed cars. ALDYS (O.S.) They do it to all the new kids. Josie finds Aldys standing next to her. JOSIE Who's of they? Aldys motions up to a second floor window. Guy and his Group look down on them, laughing. ALDYS Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys. JOSIE I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name. ALDYS When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase. JOSIE Try being named after a guitar-playing pussycat. Aldys doesn't get it. JOSIE (cont'd) Never mind. (beat) That is so awful that they hide your cars. ALDYS I guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now- She points up to the biology room- ALDYS They still would not know the difference between a synecdoche and a hyperbole. Josie laughs. JOSIE I know. It's pathetic. Aldys stares Josie down. JOSIE What? ALDYS Well, do you? JOSIE Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse." ALDYS Nice. They stop and look around. JOSIE How long will they watch us for? ALDYS Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot. JOSIE Why do they listen to Guy? ALDYS: (duh) Because he's Guy Perkins. (then) Listen, you want to walk to Na-Na's and get something to eat? JOSIE Yeah. Let's do that. They start to walk out of the parking lot. Josie is visibly thrilled - having finally found a friend. INTERIOR. NA-NA'S - LATER Josie and Aldys share a huge plate of chili fries. ALDYS Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know. JOSIE Oh I know. A WAITER delivers two huge chocolate shakes. ALDYS I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table. JOSIE Hey--I went to Northwestern! (a beat) Once. To use the bathroom. OUT THE WINDOW, Josie sees her Buick with Rob at the wheel stopped at a red light. Detailed on to the side in big white script is: "THE TIKI POST". Josie's eyes widen. The light changes. Rob pulls away. JOSIE (cont'd) (So angry) Oh. My. God. (a beat) You'll really like Northwestern. They both slurp down their shakes. JOSIE So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be? ALDYS Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist. Aldys takes another slurp of her shake. WE HEAR a muffled cell phone RINGING. ALDYS (cont'd) I think your knapsack is ringing. Josie takes the cell phone out of her knapsack and answers it. JOSIE Hello? WE INTERCUT WITH: INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - SAME Gus speaks into his phone, knitting frantically. GUS Geller, I got your message. What the hell kind of story are you pitching?! Josie smiles awkwardly at Aldys, covering the phone. JOSIE It's my dad. He worries. (into phone) Hi, Dad. I miss you too. GUS You're a sick puppy, Geller. Josie indicates to Aldys she'll be right back and walks to the back of the restaurant by the pay phones. JOSIE (into the phone) It's an expose on cafeteria food. GUS And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?! JOSIE Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf-- GUS Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing! Gus slams down his phone. JOSIE (into a dead phone) You didn't taste the pimento loaf. She looks back to the table where Aldys is dividing the check. EXTERIOR. TRACK - HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK In the middle of the track is Josie's car. The MARCHING BAND clumsily practices their formations around it. Josie and Aldys arrive at the car and Aldys pops the hood. ALDYS They love to disconnect the battery, too. She looks under the hood, reconnects the battery. Slams the hood down. ALDYS (cont'd) Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974. JOSIE Thanks. ALDYS Sure. No problem. Aldys heads to the lot for her car, and then turns around. ALDYS Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus? JOSIE Petty good. ALDYS How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year. JOSIE College? ALDYS NASA. (beat) Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other. Josie smiles. MUSIC UP: SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK'S "Magic Three" AS WE BEGIN MONTAGE: INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY Josie and Denominators walk down the hallway in unison, past Guy's Group, open their lockers in order a la "RESERVOIR DOGS", take out paper, pencils, calculators. INTERIOR. - HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY Josie and Aldys, both wearing big orange Denominator sweatshirts, are behind a table manning a bake sale. A banner behind them says: n = 3.14578697786978 Pie = $.75 No one is stopping to buy anything. Josie points to the left, Aldys looks, and Josie stuffs a whole brownie in her mouth. They laugh uncontrollably as Josie starts to choke and cough up most of the brownie. We pan down a row of nervous looking Denominator faces as they watch Josie, sitting head to head against a DIGIT, an opposing Math-a-lon competitor. They both work furiously on a problem. A judge sits between them. A makeshift scoreboard hanging off the desk shows the score is tied. Josie bangs the bell on the desk and hands the judge her card. He looks it over, and gives her team five points. They win. The Denominators erupt into cheers. They're jumping all over Josie, going crazy. As we go wider we see the gym is entirely empty, except for a handful of Denominators going crazy on one side, and a janitor sweeping up on the other. INTERIOR. MALL BOOK STORE - DAY Smiling at each other, Josie and Aldys clutch books excitedly and stand in line. WE WIDEN to reveal they're in line with NERDY ADULTS also clutching their books. At the head of the line is a blow-up poster for The New Elements Of Grammar. An OLD MAN signs books for his fans. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT It's late. Josie is typing on her laptop, referencing notes from her notebook. Schoolbooks and homework are spread around her. END MONTAGE. INTERIOR. CLASSROOM - DAY Sam is perched on the desk. The usual players in their usual seats. Aldys is standing and reading from her book. ALDYS: (reading) "All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players." SAM Anyone have any idea what Shakespeare meant by that? No one answers. SAM (contd) Anyone? Sera ... Megan ... exchange student who doesn't speak English? We CU on the students, ending on an Asian boy who smiles wildly at Sam and waves. Sam smiles, and waves back. SAM (contd) It's about disguise, playing a part. It's the theme of "As You Like It." Can anyone tell me where we see that? ALDYS Well, Rosalind disguises herself as a man and escapes into the forest. SAM Right. And it's when she's in costume that she can finally express her love for Orlando. See, Shakespeare's making the point here that when we're disguised, we feel freer. We can do things we wouldn't do in ordinary life. CU on Josie's face. She's clearly uncomfortable. Sam walks up to a huge football player, BRETT. SAM (contd) Brett when you go out on the football field in your uniform, what happens? BRETT We win? SAM You hit people. You yell. You touch other guys' butts. The class giggles. Brett looks horrified. SAM But it's okay, because you're in uniform. Disguise changes the rules (beat) I had these Spiderman pyjamas. I thought when I wore them, that I had super powers. One night I tried to walk up the side of the garage. SERA Did you make it? SAM To the Emergency Room. Yeah. Josie smiles at this, a little smitten. SAM (contd) Josie, why don't you read from Act 5, Scene 2, Rosalind's speech-- Josie stands up, starts reading-- JOSIE "No sooner had they met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed..." Josie's voice begins to fade away- INTERIOR. CLASSROOM - DAY (FLASHEACK) ANGLE BACK to Josie, now seventeen and mortified, nervously standing in class and reading a poem. Billy Prince sits to the side--she glances at him throughout the poem, it's clearly about him. JOSIE Does he notice me? Does he hear my heart screaming his name-- sometimes it's so loud I think the Gods can hear my pain. His voice is so mellifluous, oh to get just one small kiss. The CLASS laughs at her except for Billy, who smiles at her, looking slightly touched. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY (FLASHBACK) Seventeen-year-old Josie is surrounded by an elaborate, color-coded index card system for her research paper. Her friend, SHEILA, over-weight and pimply, comes running across the library at breakneck speed. She sits down next to Josie, visibly excited and pushes her index cards aside. SHEILA O.K., what have you wanted for like ever but you didn't think it would -ever happen? Josie looks at her for a moment, mulling it over. JOSIE That they'd start an Olympic team for grammar - like diagramming sentences and verb declensions and stuff. And I'm scouted for the team- just as an alternate, of course- because I'm so young. But then there's talk of me in the '96 games- SHEILA. No-, better. Something better Josie smiles. JOSIE I'm the most popular girl in school, and Billy Prince is taking me to prom. Josie laughs at the absurdity. She looks at Sheila. Sheila is dead serious. SHEILA Yes. JOSIE What? SHEILA Billy Prince is asking you to prom. JOSIE Why? SHEILA I don't know. JOSIE (beat) The poem! I knew he liked the poem! (all sinking in) Billy Prince is asking me to the prom. SHEILA That's what I'm saying. The two girls look at each other. Big smiles erupt into screams, as they jump up and down, hugging each other. SFX - The BELL RINGS. INTERIOR. SAM'S CLASSROOM (PRESENT) - SAME It's the end of class. Students pack their bags. SAM: (calling out) O.K. - just a reminder. Your paper is due in one week. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME Aldys and Josie head out of class and down the hallway towards their lockers. Josie stops in front of hers where the Makeout Couple continues their clinch, blocking her locker. Josie pauses frustrated as Sydney's Voice comes over the loudspeaker. SYDNEY (O.S.) Hey guys! Bad news--Chem wing is closed. The Hazardous Materials Crew is on the way. Now, about prom. The entire hallway STOPS to listen. The makeout Couple stop making out. SYDNEY (O.S.) Please join a committee--because we are going to KICK NORTHGLEN'S BUTT and make millennium the best prom EVER! The hallway erupts in CHEERS. Josie makes a move to go for her locker. The Makeout Couple are faster. They're back in their clinch, blocking Josie again. CU ON GUY walking with his group. GUY Rufus! Prom is gonna be Rufus. KRISTEN Rufus? GUY Yeah. I made it up. Start using it. ANGLE BACK ON JOSIE AND ALDYS. JOSIE What is with this school and prom? ALDYS Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge. JOSIE Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once. ALDYS This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique-- INTERIOR. NORTHGLEN NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY KIDS all stare at a loudspeaker. KID'S VOICE: (O.S.) And this year's prom theme is--the millennium! The Northglen kids go crazy. INTERIOR. SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME Josie reaches for her knapsack, and realizes she left it in English. JOSIE I left my bag in English. I'll see you later. Josie dashes down the hallway. INTERIOR. CLASSROOM - SAME Sam still sits at his desk. He reads a book. Josie enters. SAM Whoa. Deja Vu. JOSIE Sorry. Forgetful. Josie picks up her bookbag. She notices the book Sam's reading-- JOSIE (cont'd) (excited) Dorothy Parker-- SAM You like her? JOSIE I love the way she writes. SAM Not the happiest of souls. (reading out of book) "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop." JOSIE But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right? SAM True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope. (then) Are you sure you're seventeen? JOSIE Sure, why? SAM Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's. JOSIE Well, I'm definitely seventeen and (off clock) now definitely late-- And she smiles and runs out. INTERIOR. ALDYS' CAR - NIGHT Aldys drives, Josie has shotgun and TYKE, Aldys' nine-year-old sister, is in back. They all hold double-scooped cones and they all sing FREE TO BE YOU AND ME at full voice. TYKE See, aren't you guys glad you took a break from that Denominator stuff. I mean, you shouldn't be spending your Saturday night studying the whole time. ALDYS we should be spending it thinking of how we can better serve your baby-sitting needs? TYKE They pull up at a red light, next to an abandoned drive-in. Josie peers in, and sees a BIG GROUP OF KIDS, standing around a bonfire drinking beers, talking, a few making out. She opens her window, sticks her head out, and tries to get a better look. JOSIE What's that? ALDYS That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group. ANGLE ON: Gibby and Kristen talking by a car. ALDYS: (cont'd) Sometimes I wonder what they talk about. JOSIE Yeah, I know. ALDYS I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die? ANGLE ON: THE COOL GIRLS. GIBBY No. It's lather, rinse, repeat. ANGLE BACK ON: ALDYS AND JOSIE Suddenly, Guy pokes his head in, startling everyone. GUY Wow, if it isn't Alpo. Coming out to sniff some hydrants? Josie is frozen, but not Aldys. ALDYS Oh, Guy, you on a little break from having an original thought? Ooops, I forgot, that's all the time. Tyke gets it, and laughs. Guy doesn't get it at all. GUY You guys aren't seriously trying to hang out at The Court? ALDYS oooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan. Where do I sign up? GUY And stay away from prom. ALDYS Last I checked--this was still a free country. TYKE (singing) There's a land that I see, where the children are free- Guy's right in Aldys' face, leaning over Josie. Aldys starts to drive away. Guy keeps his head in the window while he runs alongside the car. GUY Look, geek, why don't you just go home and play with your calculator. Figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool. Guy stops running, and the car continues down the street. INTERIOR. CAR  CONTINUOUS Aldys seems a little shaken, Tyke continues singing. JOSIE Have you ever wanted to go to The Court? ALDYS Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame. JOSIE It is? ALDYS Yes, it's lame. JOSIE Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around? ALDYS Exactly. INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - DAY CLOSE ON a newspaper headline: "THE COURT - SITE FOR PARTIES, DRUGS AND WEEKEND ARRESTS" - as Gus throws the newspaper down on his desk. Josie sits across the desk from him. She reads the headline, looking very surprised. GUS Josie, I am appalled. Josie picks up the paper, and starts reading intently. JOSIE Jeez, so am I. I had no idea that these kids- let's see- turn to A14- She tries to turn to A14, but Gus grabs the paper out of her hands in a rage. GUS (trying to keep his cool) No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune. JOSIE Oh. Right. Gus angrily tries to fold the paper back 'up. He's having a hard time. Josie tries to help, but he yanks it away. Gus reads aloud from the newspaper. GUS Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night." JOSIE (disbelieving) Kristen got a quote? Gus looks up at Josie. JOSIE (cont'd) Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go. GUS Have you been there? JOSIE Uhh, no. GUS Have you been to any parties? JOSIE Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session-- Gus looks like he may combust. He opens the newspaper, finds what he's looking for, and shoves it in Josie's face. It is a picture of all of the popular kids at Southglen- Kristen, Kirsten, Gibby, Guy- they are all posing for the picture at The Court, smiling and holding beers. GUS This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo! JOSIE Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this. He points to the picture in the paper of the Popular Kids. GUS Do you even know these kids? JOSIE (trying) They hid my car-- Gus leans in very close. GUS Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it. JOSIE (very small) Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural. GUS OUT! Josie grabs her knapsack and does. INTERIOR. ANITA'S CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS Josie runs through the bullpen, past Anita's cubicle. ROGER from op/ed enters. He and Anita smile flirtatiously. ANITA Hi Roger from op/ed-- ROGER Hi Anita from classifieds. We still on for tonight? ANITA of course-- And he leans in and kisses her. She pulls away, confused. A beat. Anita kisses him again. Nothing. ANITA (contd) (can't believe she's saying it--) Y'know what? No, I don't think we are on. I think I have to stay home. (liking how it sounds) Yeah. I'm staying home! I don't know what I'll do there, but I'm gonna do it. Alone! Roger walks off. ROGER (under) Freak. EXTERIOR. JOSIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT Rob opens the door still dressed in his Tiki Post outfit. He takes one look at Josie and knows that things are not good. JOSIE Are mom and dad here? ROB No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn. JOSIE Good. She shoves her way into the house. Rob follows. INTERIOR. DEN - CONTINUOUS Josie storms into the den, and plants herself on the sofa. She sees that Rob has been watching baseball on T.V., and she turns it off. JOSIE I can't do it. I thought I could. I can't. I give up--I'm never going to be a reporter. Rob sits next to her on the couch. He looks up at the T.V.-, which is now off. ROB Did you catch the score? Josie gives him a look of death. ROB No, I mean, no big whoop. JOSIE I can't do this. She pulls the article out of her purse, and shoves it at Rob. He sees the picture of all the popular kids at The Court. ROB These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here! JOSIE Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible. ROB Why is that impossible? Josie's eyes get teary. JOSIE Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South. ROB Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team. JOSIE Rob. Please focus. He puts his arm around her. ROB Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore. JOSIE Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular? ROB Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it. JOSIE Is that true? ROB Little known fact. Josie takes this in. ROB (cont'd) Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story? JOSIE Yes, desperately. ROB Plus, if you quit you're no better than me. JOSIE Better than I... ROB That's the spirit! EXTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NEXT MORNING Josie approaches the school. She's clearly made a new attempt at style- she's teetering on too-high platform shoes and showing a blending white midriff. No one pays much attention to her. GEORGE, thirty-something African-American, the epitome of cool, waves Josie over to an open van side door. Josie looks confused and scurries to the van. JOSIE (sotto) George! What are you doing here? GEORGE Just get in the van, Josie. INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - MOMENTS LATER High-tech surveillance wonderland meets seventies living room. Tape players and monitors share space with shag carpeting and a mini-fridge. Barry White PLAYS on a TAPE. George starts to wrap wire around Josie's waist. He pins a kid's plastic "captain's wings" onto her collar. JOSIE What is this? GEORGE Hidden camera. JOSIE Wings? GEORGE We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?" JOSIE I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus. GUS (O.S) (through speaker) Geller, stop being a pain in the ass. Josie looks all around. JOSIE Gus? GUS (O.S.) No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story. JOSIE What if I say no? GUS (O.S.) I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece. Off Josie's look of concern... EXTERIOR. SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER A crush of kids flood up the stairs to the front door of the school. We see Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby walking three abreast ahead of Josie up the stairs. The Crowd parts around them. Josie heads towards them. JOSIE Hey! Kirsten, Kristen, Gibby-- What's up girlfriends? The three girls pause and turn just as Josie, caught up in the moment, doesn't see a stray backpack on the stairs in front of her. Josie trips and-- JOSIE-CAM POV: The CAMERA FACE-PLANTS into the pavement. INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - SAME George watches the monitor, winces. JOSIE-CAM POV: The CAMERA still faces the pavement. JOSIE (O.S.) (small) I'm okay. INTERIOR. COULSOM'S CLASSROOM - LATER Josie is standing, reading from her paper. Sam is rapt. JOSIE And so it is Rosalind, in disguise, who is best able to see through the disguises of others. To say to Phebe, "Mistress, know thy self," to look at love from every angle, and to realize, finally, that she is in love with Orlando-- The BELL RINGS. Class is over. Josie puts her stuff away and starts to follow the Cool Girls out. JOSIE Hey guys, wait up-- The Girls keep moving. Sam stops Josie. SAM Hey, Josie, hold on. (then) You've been hiding something from me. JOSIE Oh I don't think so. SAM Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker. JOSIE Thank you. SAM So what are you thinking for college? JOSIE College. Haven't really thought about it. SAM That's crazy. I'll get you some applications. JOSIE Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college. (beat) We just go right into sheep herding. SAM Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural. JOSIE Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear. SAM Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words-- (touching heart) in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--" SAM/JOSIE It --and swallow whole." They both take a breath in. Look away from each other. INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN  SAME George watches the monitor. GEORGE Uh oh. INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON Anita sits on Gus's desk, watches the last scene on Gus's TV, engrossed. Gus walks in and stops the tape. GUS Showtime's over! Move-it! Back to work! Anita climbs off his desk. ANITA Gus, have you ever been in love? GUS Leave. ANITA Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation. GUS Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand. ANITA You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you. Gus stares down at his tie. But he's smiling--a little. GUS Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night. ANITA Listen, I don't have any plans--you want some help? GUS No Roger from op/ed? ANITA Nope. They share a smile. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY  DAY Josie walks toward her locker, the Make out Couple is at it again. Josie's fed up. She taps the Boy on his shoulder. JOSIE Excuse me. Hi. Do you guys have some kind of schedule I could work around? He ignores Josie and goes back to his Girlfriend. Aldys, in her Denominator sweatshirt decorated with pins, approaches Josie. ALDYS Hey, where's your sweatshirt? JOSIE I  uhh, must have forgotten- ALDYS No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you. She starts to leave. ALDYS Oh  I almost forgot  I'll see you tonight at Big Cup. 7:30, right? Josie looks confused. ALDYS Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets. JOSIE Right. 7:30. ALDYS I'm late for lab. Aldys takes off. Josie looks down the hall, where Guy, Kristen and the others are all looking at a flyer pasted to the wall. GUY That is gonna be such a sweet show. I am so there. Guy looks at Tommy and Jason, who f follow his lead. TOMMY Oh, yeah, man, I'll drive. JASON It's gonna be Rufalicious. GUY (beat) You're using it wrong. They head off, en masse. Josie goes and looks at the flyer: "JIMMY CLIFF TONIGHT AT DELLOSER HALL". Josie smiles. EXTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - NIGHT Marquee reads "Jimmy Cliff." A crowd has gathered by the door. Josie gets out of cab, and walks towards the club. INTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - NIGHT Josie enters the small, smoky club. She wears what she considers to be her "hip concert outfit," an outfit that completely clashes with the Rasta wear of the other concert goers. -She reaches the BOUNCER. BOUNCER You Drinking? Josie notices the two Stoners from school standing behind her in line. JOSIE I am not 21. I am only seventeen and I still attend high school. The bouncer stamps her hand. She looks down at her hand. WE CU ON her hand, reading DELLOSER. She enters as the two Stoners approach the Bouncer. BOUNCER Two of you? A beat as the Stoners look at each other, realizing... STONER 1 (to Stoner 2) Oh, Dude-- And they run out of the club. INTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - SAME JIIAMY CLIFF is playing. The crowd sits at tables, grooving. Josie approaches the bar. A guy turns around--it's Sam. SAM Josie--out on a school night. A woman, LARA, emerges from the crowd. And puts her arm around SAM. An awkward beat. LARA Hi. JOSIE Hi. SAM Oh, right, sorry. Lara--Josie. Josie--Lara. (to Lara) Josie's a student of mine. (to Josie) Lara's my-date. LARA Nice to meet you. Another awkward pause. LARA C'mon, c'mon, let's go dance. The crowd roars over Cliff's next song as Lara drags San off into the crowd. Sam looks back briefly at Josie as we lose him into the crowd. ANGLE ON JOSIE She sees Guy's group sitting at a table and approaches an empty seat. They immediately scoot around so that the seat is taken. Undeterred, Josie sees a seat at the next table and sits down in it. She looks up to see that she is at a table of huge RASTAFARIANS. They all wear big Rasta hats and even bigger hair and are smoking a joint the size of Cuba. She smiles awkwardly. JOSIE (cont'd) Hi. Is it okay if I sit here? RASTA #1 Oh, ya mon. We accept all peoples. We are all about da' love. Josie and the Rasta's start to groove to the music. Josie looks over at Guy's table, sees they are toking off a small joint and passing it around. INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINOUS George and his DATE, a Pam Grier look-alike, sit close on the couch, grooving to the CONCERT PLAYING on the monitor and through the various speakers. CU on the monitor. JOSIE-CAM POV: The joint the size of Cuba is passed into frame. Josie's hand takes it. Catching sight of this, George and his Date exchange concerned looks. SMASH CUT TO: INTERIOR. CLUB/DELLOSER HALL - LATER Josie is high beyond belief, wearing a big Rasta hat and loudly laughing her ass off as the Rastas just stare. She can hardly keep herself in her chair. JOSIE Get it?! Get it?! He was a firecracker! She lifts up Rasta 1's dreadlocks to get his ear. JOSIE (cont'd) (yelling) A firecracker! And she cracks up again. RASTA #1 (to Rasta #2) I don't love her. Rastas share looks ill around. Then Josie hears the first strains of "The Harder They Come"-- JOSIE (cont'd) Oh my God! This music rules! And Josie proceeds to get up and take over the place--she's dancing on the table, getting up with the band and playing the bongos, all with absolutely no rhythm or style. But with a lot of whooping. The club is agog. ANGLE ON: Lara and Sam. They both look aghast. LARA She's a student of yours? SAM (in explanation) She's from Bali. And as Josie continues to dance on stage, making a total fool of herself, Jimmy Cliff turns to CAMERA. JIMMY: Freak. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - LATER Josie is on the phone, and is in the process of finishing an entire pie. JOSIE I'm telling you, Rob! I think I did it! I'm totally in! I was soo cool tonight! You'd be so-- (staring at fork) You know what's a weird word? Fork. (then) Wait! Wait! Did I tell you about my new friends? I made friends with a whole table of Rastafarians! Not one, a whole table! (noting empty pie plate, suddenly serious) Oh. My. God. Someone ate my entire pie. DISSOLVE TO: INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING Josie is asleep where we left her, her head on her hand, empty pie plate nearby. She wakes, picks her head up. Looks down at her hand, the DELLOSER stamp is faint. CLOSE UP ON her forehead. There in block letters backwards is "LOSER". She looks up at the clock, which reads: 8:30. She's late. Very late. She grabs her book bag and her keys, and races out. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING Josie strides confidently down the hallway, LOSER prominently on her forehead. She sees Guy and his Group. JOSIE Hi Guy. Guys. Guy's Guys. They stare, then snicker. GUY Hi loser. The group laughs and joins in, saying "Hey Loser." Josie's face registers confusion. JOSIE-CAM POV: We move slowly down the packed hallway, the camera shifting nervously amidst a sea of laughing kids. The LAUGHTER starts to ECHO. Josie starts to walk quickly, then run, through the gauntlet of' laughing and pointing kids. INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINUOUS WE HEAR THE LAUGHING, the JOSIE CAM JERKS frantically from KID to KID. GEORGE This can not be good-- INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS JOSIE CAM P.O.V. WE HEAR Josie BREATHING HEAVILY as she runs past KIDS who all stare or LAUGH.

GEORGE'S VAN CONTINOUS George watches the monitor, HANDS splash water. A HAND grabs a paper towel. George can now see Josie reflected in the bathroom mirror.

GUS'S OFFICE - DAY A Group is watching Gus's TV, including Bruns (the hair plug man) and Howard (arm casts). They are slack-jawed in shock. WE HEAR O.S. the SOUNDS of Josie VOMITING. Gus shakes his head sadly. GUS It's like the All-Humiliation Network. They all nod in agreement. INTERIOR. GIRLS' BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER Josie is in the fetal position on the floor of a stall. INTERIOR. DEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) The den of Josie's parents' home. Josie is decked out. She's wearing a pretty hideous metallic pink dress, matching gloves, bag, shoes. She's shining her braces, using the T.V. screen as a mirror. The PHONE RINGS. Josie grabs it. JOSIE (into phone) Hey, Billy. I'm ready. Sure, I can just wait for you on the front porch. See you in a -uhh- jiffer. She hangs up. Sixteen year old Rob, very cute and buff, enters. His pretty GIRLFRIEND is on his arm. GIRLFRIEND (mouthing to Rob) Jiffer? Rob just shrugs. EXTERIOR. JOSIE'S FRONT PORCH NIGHT (FLASHBACK) Josie, in all her prom splendor, waits out on the front porch for her date. She sees a LONG, BLACK LIMO turn the corner, headed for the house. She's hopping up and down with excitement. She checks her reflection in her compact, and then watches the limo approach. The sunroof of the limo opens and Billy Prince, the Adonis of the suburbs, stands up, sticking out of the sunroof. He waves. Josie smiles and waves back. Then, another figure joins Billy's. It's a GORGEOUS BLONDE in a slinky dress. She's standing up, sticking out of the sunroof as well. Josie looks a bit confused, but still tries to smile. Then, she sees them holding things. LITTLE THINGS. LITTLE WHITE THINGS. Before Josie realizes what's going on, her metallic ensemble is covered in dripping, oozing eggs. One whacks her right in her trifocals. BILLY (shouting) Hey, write a poem about this! Billy and his date lob a few more eggs, and their limo roars off. Josie stands on the porch, alone. She's got egg in her hair, on her face, all over her dress- everywhere. She starts to cry. Softly at first, moving into big, loud, wet sobs. She sits down on the porch, her head in her hands, and just keeps crying. DISSOLVE BACK TO INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - (PRESENT) - DAY Homeroom has just gotten out, and the halls are packed with kids. Josie is running full speed, trying to negotiate around lots of kids, in her frantic-race for the door. Kids still point and stare. She bangs into some freshmen, gets whacked by a book bag, slides some banners that kids are painting - but she won't slow down. Just as she's almost at the doors to the school, the BIG WOODEN DOOR to the front office opens. Josie can't stop. A figure emerges, but before Josie can even see who it is, she slams into it and goes down. She bangs her head on the hard linoleum floor. INTERIOR.

DISSOLVE JOSIE-CAM POV: We see two KIDS looking down into the camera. JASON Hey--you okay? Camera nods "yes" slowly. Tommy and Jason come into frame. TOMMY Wow. You took a pretty big fall. JASON Yeah. Like every loser should. And they move out of frame, laughing. JOSIE As every loser should. VOICE Are you O.K.? Josie, are you O.K.? Rob comes into frame. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Rob is bent over Josie. She rubs her eyes. JOSIE I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare. ROB No. Josie, this is real. She looks up. JOSIE Oh my God! That's worse! (beat) What are you doing here?! Rob leans in and whispers to Josie. ROB I just registered. Rob whips out his fake ID and shows it to her. ROB (cont'd) (proudly) Manufactured at the Tiki Post. Rob helps Josie up. JOSIE Are you crazy?! You can't do this. ROB This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors-it's game time! JOSIE You're twenty-three years old! ROB With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one. JOSIE Hear one. (then) Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day. SMASH CUT TO: INTERIOR. CAFETERIA - LATER Josie emerges from the cafeteria line with her tray. A LOUD CHANT comes from one of the tables. CROWD ROB, ROB, ROB She turns to see Rob in the middle of a hot dog eating contest with a HUGE WRESTLER. Rob downs his last one, raises his hands in victory. The CROWD goes WILD. Rob sits down at Guy's table. JOSIE Oh my god. ANGLE ON GUY'S TABLE GUY Dude, you rock! He high-fives Rob. A pretty girl, TRACY approached Rob. TRACY Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend... ROB (looks skyward, mouths) Thank you. (Then , to Tracy) I'm Rob. TRACY Duh. ANGLE BACK ON JOSIE Aldys approaches. ALDYS Hey  where were you last night? I was worried. Josie can't take her eyes off Rob sitting at Guy's table. Aldys notices Josie's distraction. JOSIE What? ALDYS Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried. JOSIE Oh. I forgot. Aldys is really hurt. ALDYS Well, maybe you should forget about sitting with us too. Josie just stands there all alone. EXTERIOR. TRACK - LATER Girls P.E. is over. The girls head back to the locker room.

Rob has just hit a home run with three men on. EVERYONE CHEERS him on as he runs the bases. As he comes into home, he is met with congrats, high fives. Everyone loves him. Josie watches the whole scene, seething with jealousy. INTERIOR. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - LATER Josie, post-shower, is wrapped in a towel and carrying her sweaty gym clothes. A group of GIRLS walk by her, giggling as they exit. She approaches her locker and finds it ajar and completely empty. She looks from the empty locker down to the sweaty clothes in her hand. A realization sweeps over her face. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER Josie shuffles down the hall, still wearing her cheesy green and yellow gym clothes. She is clearly beaten. She looks down the hall, stunned. It is ridiculous Rob is being followed by a posse, everyone knows his name. Girls tug on his shirt, guys slap him on the back or high-five him. JASON Hey, Rob. TOMMY Robster, what's up? BRETT The Rob man. My man Rob. GIBBY Hey, Robbie. KRISTEN Hi there Robbie Rob. Josie sees Guy approach Rob, and shake his hand. GUY Hey Robo- how's it going? ROB Nice pants, man. They are rufus. Guy smiles. Josie looks like she's going to hurl. She looks down the hall the other way- where a huge banner hangs that reads: "IMPEACH SYDNEY ANAKOWSKI. ELECT ROB STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT. TRACY Hey Rob, see you at the carnival later? STONER 1 It's Robilicious! Josie looks on the wall next to her- and sees a list: "FINAL CAST LIST FOR HAMLET. HAMLET . . . ROB." JOSIE Oh, please. Josie has seen enough, and walks on. EXTERIOR. CARNIVAL GROUNDS - NIGHT Establishing shot of a smallish carnival, Ferris wheel, midway, tea cups ride. Near the entrance reads a banner: "SOUTHGLEN HIGH SENIOR NIGHT". EXTERIOR. CARNIVAL MIDWAY - SAME Aldys and the Denominators stand in front of a booth that displays a large glass jar of jellybeans. Calculators and paper out, they're engrossed in find the answer. Josie walks by alone. The Denominators don't notice her. EXTERIOR. THE FERRIS WHEEL - SAME WE PAN DOWN the line of KIDS waiting to ride the Ferris wheel. In front are Tommy, Jason, Gibby and Kirsten. KIRSTEN This has been so much fun! We've been first in line for every ride! TOMMY That's cuz we cut every line. WE PAN DOWN to the end of the line, where we find Josie, standing alone. She's trying her best to keep her game face on. The CARNY opens the gate, the Kids pile onto the ride, two by two. Josie reaches an empty car--the last one--and gets in. The Carny holds the safety bar open. CARNY Where's your partner? JOSIE I don't--I don't have one-- CARNY (yelling loudly) I GOT A LONELY RIDE IN BUCKET SEVEN! (to Crowd) SINGLE! JOSIE Do you have to yell like that? Sam, standing by a vendor, looks over and notices Josie's predicament. TOMMY (O.S.) Of course it's Loser that's holding up the ride! Sam walks up to the Josie's bucket. SAM This seat taken? JOSIE (relieved) Thank you. He gets in. The ride JERKS into motion. SAM (nervous) Whoa. They start a slow ascent. Sam seems ill at ease. JOSIE Are you--scared? SAM I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights. JOSIE You're afraid of the Ferris wheel. SAM Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me. JOSIE Oh right. The Spiderman incident. SAM (touched) You remember that story? JOSIE Of course. I remember everything from your class. They smile at each other. The smile is interrupted by a HEAVY SWAYING of their bucket, caused by Tommy ROCKING in the bucket ahead. Sam looks a little green. SAM Yoooooow. JOSIE Don't look down! They're facing the ground at this point. SAM Out of my control. (yelling to Tommy) TOMMY! CUT IT OUT! ENOUGH! Tommy stops. Sam turns to Josie. SAM (cont'd) (defensive) I said that as a chaperone. They start to ascend again. Sam relaxes. SAM (contd) Okay This is okay. Smooth. (then) Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class? JOSIE That's what makes you interesting. (beat, recovering) As a teacher. SAM God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all. JOSIE You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom. SAM You have to say that. You're my student. JOSIE I don't have to say that. They look into each other's eyes just as Tommy RATTLES his bucket ruthlessly. TOMMY (O.S.) IF THE BUCKET'S A-ROCKIN', DON'T COME-A KNOCKIN'. Josie and Sam laugh uncomfortably. SAM Boys. JOSIE I know. SAM I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages. JOSIE Why do you do that? SAM I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me. (beat) You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you. JOSIE That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to-- The bucket is rocked again by Tommy--Sam grips the safety bar. SAM (as he rocks) Same here. They stop rocking but they're still stuck at the top. SAM (contd) All I can tell you is that when you're my age, the guys will be lined up around the block for you. They share a smile. JOSIE (suddenly shy) You have to say that. You're my teacher. SAM I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher. They look at each other, their smiles fading into realization. Suddenly, the car jerks, and they start to move down. Josie and Sam are pulled out of their reverie. They smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small laugh. WIDE SHOT of the Ferris wheel as Josie and Sam descend. SAM (V.O.) Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought. JOSIE (V.O.) When are you going to open your eyes? SAM (V.O.) I'm thinking when I'm home. EXTERIOR. BASEBALL DUGOUT - DAY Rob sits with a bunch of BASEBALL PLAYERS. MATZ and PACKER, the studs of the team, come into the dugout and join them. PACKER: Hey Rob, thanks for showing me that new grip. It totally changed my swing. ROB No problem, man. They do one of those elaborate, fraternity-like handshakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Rob sees Josie walking alone across the field. He gets an idea. ROB Hey, you guys know that girl, Josie Geller? MATZ You mean "Loser"? ROB No, dude, Josie. We used to go out and she dumped me. But we're still good friends. And she is amazing, if you know what I mean. The guys are all stunned. INTERIOR. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - DAY Gibby stands staring at a skeleton with Rob and the Cool Girls. GIBBY All right--that's it. Just water and Ex-Lax till prom. ROB Hey--Josie's Dad invented that stuff.

TRACK - DAY Rob stands behind the bleachers with Tommy, Jason, and Guy. TOMMY No way. JASON She used to date the drummer for The Big Bad Voodoo Daddys? GUY No way. I always wanted to be a drummer.

CAFETERIA - DAY Josie turns with her tray after paying. Aldys sees her. ALDYS Hey, Josie--I'm really sorry I snapped at you. Do you wanna-- Josie sees Rob waving her over to "the table" where Kristen, Gibby and the gang sit. JOSIE Oh, Aldys, y'know, I have to-- And Josie walks over to Guy's table, leaving Aldys staring after her. Josie sits down at the table. Everyone stares at her. GIBBY Hey Josie. It's Josie, right? KRISTEN Can I just say--I totally love Ex-Lax. JOSIE (confused) Okay, that's good to know-- TOMMY I can't believe you dated Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Josie shoots a look at Rob. ROB Hey, I told you--Josie doesn't like to talk about that. KIRSTEN Yeah, Tommy, that's totally gochay. GIBBY I think it's pronounced gauche. JOSIE Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft. A silent beat. Josie thinks she may have blown it. GIBBY Duh, of course you would know that. From being on your yacht in the south of France. They all smile at her. Josie soaks in her newfound popularity. INTERIOR. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY On the walls are SAFE SEX posters. On the front desk, pamphlets on sexually transmitted diseases share space with plastic biology cross-section models of male and female reproductive organs. Sam stands in front of his English class, impatiently looking at his watch. Josie looks up from her desk, sees Anita waving wildly from the other side of the glass door. Josie's eyes widen, she starts to make "get out of here" movements. Sam notices Josie and follows her gaze to Anita. He opens the door, speaks sotto to Anita. SAM Hi. You're here for the sex talk? ANITA (happily taken aback) Well. I like a man who gets to the point. SAM You're Pam? ANITA (frisky) If you say so. Sam turns to the class. SAM Welcome juniors and seniors, this is Pam Kitterman. She's our district health counselor. She's here to lead our sex discussion. He ushers a surprised Anita to the front of the room. Josie reacts. ANITA I am? Oh, I am. Hi. Okay. Sex. Yes, well, sex. What's to say really, y'know? You like a guy, you do it. Sometimes he calls. Sometimes he doesn't. Anita leans into Josie, talks sotto. ANITA (contd) (whispering) Hi! JOSIE (also whispering) What are you doing here?! ANITA I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox! (then normal voice to Josie). Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal. (looking at watch) Oh look. Class is over already. SAM I thought this was a 45-minute seminar. ANITA Right. Right. Anita walks back to the front of the classroom. ANITA (contd) Okay, sex. Let's see. Sex is really fun. (off Josie's look) When you're old enough. Which none of you are, trust me I should know cuz when you lose it to some guy named Junior with really bad breath in the back of a van at a Guns and Roses concert you're gonna wish you listened to your Mom when she said, y'know, no one's gonna want to buy the whole friggin ice cream truck when you're handing out the popsicles for free. There's a deafening silence. The kids are amazed. ANITA (contd) Okay. Any questions? INTERIOR. SCIENCE CLASSROON - LATER The Kids all have bananas and condoms. They are in various stages of putting the condom over the banana. Anita walks among them, clearly more comfortable with her role now. ANITA Okay. I know it's hard. Titters from the group. ANITA (contd) Difficult. But safe sex is really important. I try to practice it every day. Josie reacts. ANGLE ON KIRSTEN & KRISTEN. Their condoms are snugly on their bananas. They stare at Josie. KRISTEN wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different. GIBBY Sometimes opposites attract. KIRSTEN Yeah. Look at Bert and Ernie. WE ANGLE ON ANITA. She's walking authoritatively up the aisle towards the front. ANITA So just..imagine the bananas are the real thing. She takes a rather large banana off a desk and looks at it. She snorts. ANITA (contd) In a land called "every man's fantasy". She looks up, sees the real MISS KITTERMAN (we can tell from the model of a uterus she carries), standing outside the door and waving. Without missing a beat, Anita pulls down a shade on the door and locks it. ANGLE ON: JOSIE AND TRACY still struggling with condoms. TRACY God, I can't do this. JOSIE Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas. TRACY You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time. JOSIE Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person. ANGLE ON SAM, listening. Josie is oblivious. JOSIE (cont'd) You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives. TRACY But I'm not a penguin. SAM It's an analogy. A surprised Josie looks up to see Sam next to her. She lets her condom go. And it flies off her banana into his face. Josie turns to Tracy. JOSIE Excuse me. I have to go die now. The class is interrupted by Sydney over the loudspeaker: SYDNEY (O.S.) (over speaker) Hey guys--Sydney again! Don't forget--No going into the library cuz of that little asbestos problem. And about prom Everyone freezes. Dead silence. SYDNEY (cont'd) Really bad news. We just got the word from intelligence-- Northglen High is doing the Millennium too! Complete chaos. SCREAMING terror. A GIRL faints. Sera squeezes her banana so hard it oozes out of its skin. Other KIDS are beating their bananas against desktops. Brett, the football player, absentmindedly peels his banana and begins eating it. SAM All right guys, let's calm down. Calm down. (no response) Sit! They all do, including Anita. SAM (contd) Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea. ANITA OH! How about "Under the Sea?" She's met with a round of "boos". Anita reacts. ANITA (contd) Well excuse me. SAM What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"? The Class lets out a GIANT GROAN on that one. GIBBY What do you think we are? Amateurs? GUY Josie. SERA That's not a theme. GUY No, Josie will have the answer. A long beat. Expectant faces all turn to Josie. She looks at Tracy. JOSIE How about--' (coming to her) meant for each other--Famous couples throughout history? Another beat as the Class considers. GUY (smiles and nods) Yeah. That's it. The Class suddenly CONCURS. CLASS Yeah. /That's it. /Rufus. Josie soaks in all the approval like a sponge. JOSIE Thanks. Thank you. Josie looks from Sam and Anita's smiling faces to find Guy smiling at her. CLOSE UP ON A BANNER reading: "MILLENNIUM". It comes down, replaced by one that reads: "MEANT FOR EACH OTHER...

The Girls notice Guy's interest. JOSIE Rob's? GUY Yeah, you gonna be there? Josie stumbles on a step Guy immediately reaches out to steady her. She melts. She can't even speak, so she just nods. GUY Good. I'll see you tonight. Guy walks off. GIBBY He is totally crunching on you. JOSIE (confused) Do I want to be crunched? GIBBY By Guy? GIBBY/KRISTEN/KIRSTEN Oh yeah. INTERIOR. SUN TIMES ELEVATOR - DAY CAMERA PANS the faces of some dull-looking workers. It stops on Josie, who stands out in her teen garb and huge knapsack. A star struck female WORKER turns to her. WORKER I really loved you in the sex-ed scene. Josie reacts. INTERIOR. BULLPEN - CONTINOUS Josie spills out the elevator and races through the bullpen with Rhoda in pursuit. RHODA Splendiferous-- Josie stops, turns back to her. JOSIE Totally. Josie keeps going. A confused Rhoda stares after her. She passes Merkin's desk. He is still on the phone. MERKIN (into phone) No way ... Yeah? ... No way. Josie reaches over, grabs the phone out of his hand and hangs up without missing a beat. She continues on as Merkin stares after her. Josie reaches the conference room door. An older WOMAN runs out crying. INTERIOR. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS Rigfort presides over a staff meeting. CLOSE UP on stunned office WORKERS' faces. RIGFORT Alrighty then--next on the agenda-sack races at the company picnic-yes or no? Josie sneaks in. She pushes past workers to get to a chair, big backpack whacking them as she goes. JOSIE Hi. Sorry I'm late. (pushing past chairs) Sorry. Excuse me-- Josie takes the chair next to Anita's. Anita looks her up and down. ANITA (sotto) I love that jacket. RIGFORT Miss Geller, what's the status on your story? JOSIE Oh it's great. Totally Rufus. Gus and Anita look at each other, both mouthing "Rufus?" JOSIE (cont'd) I have, um-- Josie dumps out her backpack on the table. Teen items spill out-notebooks, CDs, barrettes, a hacky sac, a Frisbee, glitter nail polish. She rifles through it all-- JOSIE (cont'd) --notes here somewhere-(picking up paper) There's my math homework! RIGFORT Geller, I don't need your notes. I need your story. Though I speak for everyone when I say I've seen the tapes. Compelling stuff. All the workers nod in agreement. RIGFORT (cont'd) But I want a story in two weeks. I'm saving the "Life and Style" cover for you. You're gonna make one hell of a reporter. Oh, and if you don't, you and Gus are fired. Josie and Gus react. RIGFORT (cont'd) Now, onto the next order of business. Marketing department-yes or no? EXTERIOR. JOSIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE  NIGHT Beer cans and kids litter the lawn. Josie pulls into the driveway. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S PARENTS HOUSE  SAME Josie makes her way through the THRONGS OF KIDS. It's a big high school "rager" lots of big blue keg cups, drunk girls, etc. The cool Girls are present and socializing. Josie finally makes her way to the kitchen. INTERIOR. KITCHEN - SAME Rob is mixing margaritas, wearing a big sombrero. Tracy sits on the counter, gazing lovingly at Rob's every move. JOSIE Hey Rob, what's going on? TRACY I'm Rob's prom date. Josie glares at Rob. JOSIE Really? (pulling Rob aside) Rob-, that girl is sixteen. ROB And a gymnast! JOSIE She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal. Josie feels an arm around her shoulder. It's Guy. GUY Hey there. JOSIE Hey. There. Guy takes Josie's hand. GUY Come here. I want to ask you something. Rob watches them leaving the kitchen. ROB (to Josie, calling after) See you around the cellblock, Mrs. Robinson. Josie turns around and gives him a death look. Tracy turns to Rob. TRACY Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up? ROB Well, a ball player. TRACY No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame. Tracy starts to giggle. Rob does not. INTERIOR. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Guy and Josie stand in front of Josie's old room. A bicycle license plate that says-"JOSIE" is nailed to the door. She stands in front of it. JOSIE Maybe we should go in a different room? GUY I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there. Guy reaches for the doorknob. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S OLD BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS They go in. Josie sees her spelling bee trophies- with her name. She turns them around, trying to appear nonchalant. As Guy enters, he eyes the trophies, the stuffed animals, the many sets of encyclopedias. GUY Wow, Rob's sister must be such a loser. Josie manages a weak smile. Guy sits on the bed. GUY Come here, sit down. She sits on the bed, and then sees a picture of her and her family on the bedside table. She dives across the bed to overturn it. GUY I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we didn't hit it off right at the beginning but- JOSIE Yes. I'll go. Yes. Guy leans in as if to kiss her and whispers... GUY Rufus. (then pulling away) But I don't even know where you live. JOSIE You know what? Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo. GUY Cool. I'll catch you later. Guy leaves. Josie is ecstatic and flops back on her bed. Stuffed animals fall all around her. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY Josie and Rob walk confidently through the hallway. Kids greet and high five them both. JASON Hey Jos. Hey Robster. BRETT Looking good guys. TOMMY Hey Jos. Rob, rufus kegger. Rob and Josie turn the corner. JOSIE Rob, this is unbelievable. I mean-- Josie shoves through the double doors leading into the gym. INTERIOR. GYM - CONTINUOUS The place is a flurry of activity, a staging area for prom. Various committees are set up at tables throughout the room. Josie and Rob enter. JOSIE --I spent my whole life wanting to fit in, and now-- Gibby and Kirsten run up to Josie. GIBBY Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica? JOSIE Betty. Gibby turns to Kirsten. GIBBY Told you. And they move off. Rob spots Tracy and moves off to her. SAM (O.S.) I always liked Betty better. Josie turns, sees Sam. JOSIE You did? And they begin to walk through the prom prop area, and it begins to appear like a romantic date--they pass flowers, he picks one out, they pass a bistro table, a backdrop of a sunset follows them for awhile, etc. SAM Oh yeah. Betty was so spunky and fun. Veronica may have had great legs, but she was too moody. Very high maintenance. Josie laughs. ANGLE ON: A TABLE where Kristen and Tommy are selling prom tickets. Aldys is standing in front of them. ALDYS You can't not sell me a ticket to prom. TOMMY Listen, Alpo--we can do whatever we want. ALDYS Oh, I get it. It's that pesky making change part that's confusing you guys. Here. I'll make it easy. (holding up money) Money- (drops money, takes ticket) Ticket. Aldys takes her ticket, walks off. Tommy and Kristen turn to each other and start whispering conspiratorially. ANGLE BACK ON: JOSIE AND SAM Sera runs up to Josie. SERA Josie, were Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum a couple? Josie and Sam share a look. JOSIE Well, in a strict sense, probably not. But for prom--sure. SERA Thanks! Sera turns off. SAM You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude. JOSIE (shyly) Thanks. (beat) They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee? SAM Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common. JOSIE But Humpty Dumpty was alone. SAM That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody. JOSIE That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us-- SAM Yeah. To watch the world go by.-- JOSIE To put us back together again when we fall. They share a meaningful glance and a smile. SAM Our penguin, right? JOSIE Do you think you'll find her? SAM Yeah, actually I do. They are lost in each other. They lean closer, as if they may kiss, then Sam breaks the moment. SAM Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth! JOSIE What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college-- SAM No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you. JOSIE Oh--yikes! SAM I told him (teasing) --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate! JOSIE Wow. You believe in me that much-- SAM Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story. As they share a meaningful look, WE FREEZE FRAME. INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - LATER Gus and Josie sit in front of his TV. The image of Sam and Josie is frozen on the screen. GUS That's your story! JOSIE You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No. GUS It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system-- JOSIE He's my teacher! GUS And that's the best part. (bannering with his hands) "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it! JOSIE There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me. GUS Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it. JOSIE You already pitched this to Rigfort?! Gus leans in, now all business. GUS Josie, this isn't a joke. You heard Rigfort. It's both of our asses on the line. This is your story. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT Josie is getting ready for prom. She wears her bathrobe and is doing her make-up. She looks over at her dresser where she eyes the camera/flight wings pin tentatively. INTERIOR. DEN - NIGHT Rob, in boxers, a dress shirt, and socks is filling flasks with vodka. Josie comes in the door wearing a lovely Elizabethan gown. She looks absolutely beautiful. ROB Wow, Josie- you look really- JOSIE (hopeful) Rufus? ROB Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus. JOSIE Thanks. And what are - ROB Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business". He puts on his black wayfarer sunglasses, and does the famous slide into the living room. Josie laughs. JOSIE Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought-- ROB I know. Rob smiles and exits. Josie nervously checks her reflection in the T.V. - just like she did eight years ago. She takes a deep breath, and goes out. EXTERIOR. FRONT PORCH - SAME Josie comes out on the porch, and sees the limo rounding the corner, just like eight years before. The sunroof opens. And Guy stands up - holding something. Josie panics - and starts to take cover - but then sees he's holding a dozen white roses. And holding them out to her. GUY Come on beautiful - what are you waiting for? Josie, smiling, runs down the driveway to the limo. EXTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT Prom night. And it really is magical. Twinkling lights dot the trees, MUSIC wafts out from the club. A neon sign that says "Meant For Each Other" blinks above the building.- COUPLES make their way inside. We see MORK a MINDY, ANTONY a CLEOPATRA and Sera dressed as a RABBIT. Annoyed, she turns back to her lagging date, Brett, dressed as a TORTOISE. SERA Hello! If you don't hurry up we're gonna miss the whole thing! Gibby, Kirsten, and Kristen exit limos with their DATES. They all wear the same straight blonde wig, and look at each other in horror. GIBBY Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea. KRISTEN Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie. Kirsten's wearing a short, tight miniskirt. KIRSTEN And I'm Evening Gown Barbie. GIBBY Right. That's not an evening gown. KIRSTEN It is on Barbie. Josie and Guy approach, dressed in Elizabethan costume. They look great. KRISTEN Josie, you look Rufus. KIRSTEN Who are you guys? GIBBY Don't tell meyou're Medieval Barbie. JOSIE Rosalind and Orlando. (nothing) From "As You Like It"? (more blank stares) Shakespeare? It's like talking to a sack of hammers. Guy interjects. GUY Look! I get to have a sword! And they all ooh and ahh. INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB  CONTINOUS WE FOLLOW Josie and the group into the prom. The place looks amazing. Lights, ice sculptures, champagne fountains. WE PAN DOWN the buffet. A BOY dressed as a jar of PEANUT BUTTER and his date, JELLY, are getting food. Peanut Butter turns away from the buffet and bumps into a GIRL dressed as a CHOCOLATE BAR. PEANUT BUTTER oh, sorry. There's a magical beat as they smile at each other. CHOCOLATE BAR That's okay-- Jelly looks on, chagrined. We reach two OLDER GENTLEMEN in tuxes who carry clipboards and wear big buttons that read: NATIONAL PROM JUDGE. They contemplate the ice sculpture. JUDGE #1 It's deft and unique without being derivative. JUDGE #2 (looking off) Hey! Pigs in blankets! And he runs off. INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT Josie sits with the COOL GROUP at a table. Kristen is making odd faces. JOSIE Kristen, what are you doing? KRISTEN I'm practicing my surprised face for when we get named to prom court. JOSEPH and a very pregnant MARY approach their table and try to sit down. KIRSTEN Sorry. There's no room at this table. Joseph and Mary amble off. Guy turns to Josie. GUY You having fun? JOSIE (meaning it) Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her. INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINUOUS Candles are lit. George's Date sits on the couch. The monitor is on showing the JOSIE CAM POV. He flips the switch, the lights dim and a small disco ball starts moving slowly. George settles in next to his Date. INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS The entire office is crammed into Gus's office. Anita sits up front, spellbound, watching the JOSIE CAM. Gus stands in back. Okay, he's a little interested too. ANITA This is the most beautiful prom I have ever been to. Cynthia runs in with a bowl of popcorn. CYNTHIA Did I miss the crowning? MERKIN No, but I'm closing the pool in five minutes. Merkin holds out a bowl of cash. MERKIN (cont'd) Josie's odds are 3 to 1. 2 to 1 for Prom court. And even odds the kid sticks himself with the sword by the end of the night. INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - CONTINUOUS WE PAN ACROSS the dance floor where we see POPEYE & OLIVE OYL, SONNY & CHER, the BLUES BROTHERS. WE HOLD on ROBIN dancing with BATGIRL. BATMAN approached and taps Robin's shoulder-- BATMAN May I have this dance- And Batgirl steps aside--Robin and Batman dance happily away. ANGLE ON ROB trying to slow dance with Tracy (dressed like REBECCA De MORNAY), but she is so-drunk she's having trouble balancing. TRACY Are you having fun? ROB Yeah. Definitely. He tries to stand her up on her own. TRACY Good. Gibby gave me champagne. ROB Maybe we should sit. He helps her to a chair next to the dance floor. They both sit. Next to them, a ravenous MISS PIGGY eats with her date KERMIT looking on. She picks up an hors d'oeuvre and stares at it horrified. MISS PIGGY Oh my God! Is this a pig in a blanket?! Tracy looks at Rob, and gets serious. TRACY Rob, I've - I've thought about it a lot. And I think- I mean, I know. You're the one. My penguin. Rob looks at her. She's young. She's beautiful. She's tipsy. She's trying to put her legs behind her head. ROB Wow - I- TRACY Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex. He looks around. It's high school prom. A skinny kid is getting beat up in a corner. Other kids are sneaking smokes. He can't do this. ROB I'm gonna get you some water. And then, I think we should get back out on that dance floor and boogie. Rob gets up, kisses Tracy on the top of her head, and heads for the refreshment table. Tracy, her leg still around her head falls backwards into Kermit's lap. Kermit looks down, surprised and interested. Miss Piggy notices, gives him a big "Harumph", tosses her hair, and leaves. ANGLE BACK ON: THE COOL TABLE. Gibby is staring O.S. in horror. GIBBY You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom? KRISTEN That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen? (beat) Did I say that out loud? WE FOLLOW Kristen's stare to the prom entrance where Aldys and the Denominators enter in pairs, one behind the other, attached together with rope, to form a human ladder. They cross the dance floor, interrupting everything with their unwieldy, tied-together conga line. They approach the Cool Table. GIBBY So what are you supposed to be? Other than freaks? ALDYS We're DNA. A double helix. But I guess you'd know that if you'd actually passed bio. Kristen reaches out and touches the rope binding Denominator #1 to Aldys. Denominator #1 slaps her hand away. DENOMINATOR #1 Please don't touch the hydrogen. It's rented. Kristen reacts. INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - ON THE STAGE  LATER Sam takes the stage, with a card in his hand. SAM Well, the moment has arrived. He looks at the card. SAM Our 1999 prom court - the princesses are - Miss Kristen Rey, Miss Kirsten Leosis and Miss Gibby Zarefsky. And the princes are Mr. Thomas Salamey, Mr. Jason Way, and Mr. Rob - Sam looks at the card, and then looks around. Nobody can help him. SAM Mr. Rob ... Mr. Rob! The crowd cheers. Gibby, Kirsten, and Kristen all jump in preplanned delight. Rob seems genuinely surprised. Jason carries Tommy up to the stage piggyback. The girls make their way to the stage, and put on their "PROM COURT" sashes. Sam looks to the card again. SAM Next up - Southglen's Prom King Guy is already halfway to the stage- SAM Guy Perkins! The crowd goes wild. Guy reaches the stage and takes his crown and scepter. SAM And - this year's prom queen - Sam looks at the card, then at Josie. Josie is standing; eyes open, staring at the podium... INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS The Crowd is rapt, waiting for the announcement. Anita has her eyes squeezed shut, praying for the win... INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - ANGLE ON SAM. SAM Ladies and gentlemen  Josie Geller! The Crowd CHEERS like crazy, Josie smiles. INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS The Crowd goes crazy, hugging each other and jumping up and down. ANITA Yes! You go girl! Yes! Yes! Anita gives Gus a big hug. Gus is completely taken aback. Merkin dolefully hands out money. INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - CONTINUOUS- Josie is hugged and congratulated as she makes her way, elated, to the stage. Sam places the Queen's tiara on her head and hands her a bouquet of flowers. They lock eyes for a moment. SAM And now - as it is custom - the king and queen will have their first dance. ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Guy and Josie begin to dance. From Josie's P.O.V., it's in SLOW MOTION, the world glittering and wonderful around her. GUY Hey--what are you thinking about? JOSIE Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold". (beat) What about you? What are you thinking about? GUY (taking a beat, happily) My sword. It's like a switch has been flicked on in Josie's brain. JOSIE Oh. GUY Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world. JOSIE You said that already. INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - BUFFET - MINUTES LATER Josie stands by the buffet in her tiara, turns and comes face to face with Sam. They're both taken aback by the other's beauty. SAM Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen. JOSIE Thanks. So do you. They both laugh, embarrassed, at Josie's flub. SAM I always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits. Like I'm at my own wedding or something. An awkward beat. SAM (cont'd) You wanna-- He gestures towards the dance floor. Josie smiles. JOSIE Yeah, okay-- And they walk off onto the dance floor. ANGLE ON: THE SIDE OF THE DANCE FLOOR. Guy approaches Aldys. GUY Hey, listen--it's prom. How about we let all the old shit go. Would you like to dance? Aldys can't help it. She smiles, a little flattered. GUY (cont'd) If it's okay with the rest of the double helix. Aldys smiles and unhooks herself from the group. And starts to dance with Guy. ANGLE ON: JOSIE AND SAM as they continue to dance. SAM Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on. JOSIE Well, are you here with anybody? SAM No, I'm alone. JOSIE It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you? Sam smiles at this. SAM You're amazing, Josie Geller. ANGLE ON: GUY AND ALDYS as they dance, WE SEE the Cool Girls and Jason standing to the side of the dance floor laughing Gibby reaches into her purse and pulls out a CAN OF ALPO. She hands it to Jason who pulls a CAN OPENER out of his pocket, opens the lid. He hands it to Kirsten who take the lid off. She hands the can to Kristen, who hands the can to Tommy. SAM So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth? JOSIE Yeah, I have. CLOSE UP on Josie's HAND as she subtlety removes her hidden camera pin and drops it to the ground. JOSIE (cont'd) There's something I have to tell you-- Her foot comes down on top of it. INTERIOR. GEORGE'S VAN - CONTINUOUS George is making out with his Date when the monitor suddenly FRITZES OFF. George looks up. GEORGE What the--?! George stands and hits the side of the monitor. INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Gus's monitor flicks to static. The Crowd lets out a horrified GASP. CYNTHIA Tell him what?! Tell him what?! INTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS Sam looks deep into Josie's eyes. SAM There's something I have to tell you, too-- Josie's eyes shift from Sam to over his shoulder. She spots Aldys, who smiles at her. Josie's eyes travel up to the can of DOG FOOD. FLASH: TEENAGE JOSIE on the porch, facing Billy and his Date. FLASH: TEENAGE JOSIE with egg dripping all over her. BACK TO PRESENT. JOSIE NOOOOOOO! SLOW MOTION as Josie lunges for Aldys and pulls her to floor as Tommy, off-balance, dumps the dog food all down Guy's front. The Crowd stops dead, staring. The can, now empty, rolls slowly off the dance floor, the metal rolling noise ECHOING in the silence. GUY (to Josie) What is your problem?! GIBBY I knew it. You are a loser. KRISTEN You ruined the whole thing! KIRSTEN You so do not deserve to be prom queen. Everyone is still staring. It's dead quiet. JOSIE Let me tell you something. It is still silent. Josie takes a deep breath, and looks around the room. JOSIE (cont'd) I don't care about being the prom queen. I am twenty five years old. Looks of confusion and teenage disgust. Rob is pissed. Sam looks shocked. JOSIE (cont'd) I'm here as an undercover reporter for the Sun Times for God's sake and I've been beating my brains out trying to impress you. She tears off her crown, and chucks it. She's on a roll. JOSIE (cont'd) I want to tell you something. You people- Guy, Gibby, the rest of you who have been keeping the geeks down through the ages. You will spend your lives trying to figure out ways to keep others down, because it makes you feel more important. And you will miss out on so much. (indicating Aldys) Why her, huh? What did she ever do to you? Let me tell you something about this girl. She is unbelievable. I was new here, and she befriended me- no questions asked. But you people, you were my friends only after my brother, Rob... She points out Rob in the crowd. He's mortified. JOSIE (cont'd) posed as a student and told you to like me. But y'know--l have to thank you. I got to go to an amazing prom. I got to be prom queen. I got to be cool. It felt good. (beat) But not as good as being myself. (turns to crowd) And to all of you-- there's a big world out there. Bigger than prom. Bigger than high school. When you get there, it won't matter if you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school. What matters is that you don't regret who you were, who you are-What if Steven Spielberg had quit the audio/visual club because it wasn't "cool"? What if Rosie O'Donnell had stopped cracking jokes because someone told her they were stupid? What if Michael Jordan never went back to basketball after he got cut from his high school team?. (a beat) In this room right now, there could be a future Nobel Prize winner, a Supreme Court Justice, an amazing Mom. Find out who you are and don't be afraid of it. (a beat) And if you'll all excuse me, I have some business to take care of. Reaction shots' all around. Kids start clapping, hollering, whooping. The MUSIC STARTS UP again. They all go back to dancing The Denominators lead their own conga line. ANGLE ON: JOSIE She looks around for Sam but he is gone. She runs out, brushing past the Judges. ANGLE ON: JUDGES Judge #2 dabs his eyes. JUDGE #1 This prom had it all. Laughter, tears, an amazing climax. Judge #2, still overcome, just raises his "two thumbs up." EXTERIOR. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER Josie exits the club, looking for Sam. George runs up to her. GEORGE Hey--I lost the feed! What happened with Coulson? Gus is going crazy! Out of the shadows emerges Sam. The look on his face says he just heard everything. JOSIE So--surprise! He shakes his head in disbelief and walks off. Josie chases after him. He turns back to her. SAM "Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?! JOSIE No, surprise, I thought you'd be-- SAM What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you? JOSIE (touched) You were attracted to me? SAM Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical. JOSIE Wait, I was going to tell you-- SAM You set me up. For a story. (beat) You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you. JOSIE But now you don't have to-- SAM Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist! JOSIE I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person! SAM The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker. JOSIE I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again. Sam turns and starts to walk away. JOSIE (cont'd) Please. Please don't walk away. SAM I just can't look at you the same way. Sam gets into his car and drives off. Josie is devastated. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATER Josie, still in the prom dress, rounds the corner of her apartment hallway and sees Rob, still in his Risky Business get-up, slumped in front of the door. ROB Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay. JOSIE Really? He gets up. He's not happy. ROB No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age. JOSIE I wasn't even thinking about- ROB No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys? JOSIE I- ROB No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up. He storms off. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT Josie lies amidst the needlepoint pillows, still in her prom costume. She stares blankly at the ceiling. INTERIOR. GUS'S OFFICE - DAY Gus slaps a newspaper down on his desk. CLOSE ON - the front page of the paper, and not just any newspaper - THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE - the Sun Times' rival. There is a PHOTO of Josie from Prom with the headline that reads: "REPORTER REVEALED AT LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL". Josie picks it up, and starts reading. GUS Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us. JOSIE Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story. GUS I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter. Josie stands. Slams down the paper. JOSIE We are not screwed. Yes, I made a mistake. But we will have a story. (beat) You will have an amazing story. Josie exits. INTERIOR. SUN TIMES BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS Josie walks out of Gus's office, continues, determined, towards the elevators. Anita falls into step with her. ANITA Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you? JOSIE Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do. ANITA You need my help? JOSIE No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own. Josie walks past Merkin's desk. She holds out her hand to Merkin. JOSIE (cont'd) Merkin. Highlighter. Merkin slaps a highlighter into her hand, she continues on. Anita watches her go. EXTERIOR. SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Josie, looking quite the professional in stylish pantsuit and briefcase, bounds up the steps, two at a time. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME Josie walks down the hall, purposefully - she is on a mission. Groups of kids stop and stare at her, but this time, Josie doesn't even notice. As Josie rounds a corner, she comes face to face with Guy, who is at his locker. He looks at her. She smiles. And now it is Guy that is nervous. He drops a pile of papers, tries awkwardly to gather them. Josie looks at him - and for the first time we see it register on her face - this guy is just a seventeen- year-old kid. GUY Uh, hey, umm--Ms. Geller. This is totally embarrassing but my mom, she's all worried about me getting a job after graduation. She wanted me to ask you about like, an internship for me, at the Sun Times? Josie smiles big. JOSIE I'll do what I can. And tell your mom not to worry - you'll do O.K. Josie continues down the hall. INTERIOR. LOCKER ROOM - SAME The guys' locker room. A bunch of GUYS are getting dressed after P. E. JOSIE (O.S.) WOMAN COMING THROUGH! COVER UP WHAT YOU DON'T WANT SEEN! And with that Josie comes walking into the locker room, completely unruffled, and storms over to Coach Romano's office, just as he is leaving it. JOSIE Hi, Coach Romano, my name is Josie Geller, from the Chicago Sun Times Listen, you know the local sports guy for the Sun Times, Jim Lakin? COACH Sure, every coach in the area tries to get Jim to cover his team. Josie puts her arm around the coach, and leads him back into his own office. JOSIE Well, what would you say if I told you that I could guarantee that Jim and every other reporter in the area would be at the game? COACH I'd say you can have whatever the hell you want. Josie smiles, together they enter his office and close the door. INTERIOR. JOSIE'S APARTMENT - DAY Josie sits at her disk, typing on her laptop, engrossed. JOSIE (V.O.) Someone once told me that to write well you have to write what you know. This is what I know. I am twenty five years old. I have never really kissed a guy. A geek to the core, most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the teacher. INTERIOR. GUS' OFFICE - DAY Gus comes in, snaps on the light, sits at his desk, and opens his newspaper. He pulls out, the "Life and Style" section. And there it is. Front page - "NEVER BEEN KISSED BY JOSIE GELLER." There are three pictures next to the article. One is Josie at age 17, one is her recent prom picture, and one is her as a normal, 25 yr. old adult. JOSIE (V.O.) High school was more of the same. Then, at seventeen, it seemed as if my luck was about to change. The cutest guy in school asked me to senior prom - but it turned out he invited me as a cruel joke. I have never fully recovered. INTERIOR. SUN TIMES LUHCHROOH - DAY Anita and Cynthia read the article, in the staff lunch room, over a shared bag of microwave popcorn. They are astounded- JOSIE (V.O.) Yes, it is embarrassing to share this with the world. But it would be hard to explain what I learned, and how I learned it, without sharing this humiliating history. EXTERIOR. A HOUSE - MORNING The Sun Times lies on the front mat. The door opens; we see a pair of bare feet. A hand reaches down to grab the paper. WE PAN UP to reveal Sam in all his depressed glory--sweats, unshaven, bleary eyed. JOSIE (V.O.) I received an assignment, my first as a reporter, to enroll in high school as a student, to gain some insight into kids today. Understandably, returning to high school was my worst nightmare. Sam shuts the door. EXTERIOR. SOUTHGLEN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Kids stream into school. JOSIE (V.O.) What I found? INTERIOR. MRS. KNOX'S CIASSROOM - DAY Mrs. Knox, wearing the sombrero, teaches her class. JOSIE (V.O.) There's still that one teacher, who marches to her own drummer- And in the back row, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby are laughing an talking-- JOSIE (V.O.) Those girls are still there. The ones that, even as you grow up, will still be the most beautiful girls that you've ever seen close up. EXTERIOR. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY The BASEBALL TEAM as they practice- JOSIE (V.O.) The athletes - and the immense sense of fraternity and loyalty that they share- INTERIOR. SCIENCE LAB - DAY Aldys and the Denominators- making smores over a bunson burner getting into a melted chocolate and marshmallow fight- and laughing hysterically- JOSIE (V.O.) The smart kids. Who everyone else always knew as the brains. But who I just knew as my soulmates, my teachers, my friends. EXTERIOR. PARKING LOT - DAY Guy, Tommy and Jason, as they get out Guy's car, in the parking lot- JOSIE (V.O.) And there's still that one guy, the one who is so perfect in every way, from the muscles in his shoulders- EXTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY We focus in on Guy, as he takes the front steps two at a time- JOSIE (V.O.) - to the way he, in his own way, struggles to uphold tradition. Southglen would not have been the same without him. High school would not be the same without him. I would not have been the same without him. INTERIOR. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY Guy, his buddies, Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby, sign yearbooks, hang out by the lockers- JOSIE (V.O.) All of these things made me miserable at seventeen. But at twenty five I finally see that this - all of this- is just the way it should be. It is all part of this thing- high school. A time in our lives that we can never truly repeat. A time that shapes us. A time that makes us who we are, for years to come. EXTERIOR. NEWSSTAND - DAY HANDS grab Chicago Sun Times at the newsstand- JOSIE (V.O.) High school- going through it the first time- helped make me who I am. But going there a second time made me see that who I am is O.K. I always wanted to be "in", but seven years later, when they finally opened the door, I somehow gained the confidence to stay outside, firmly, happily. EXTERIOR. "EL" TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY About 75% of the people have their Life and Style sections opened, reading Josie's piece. JOSIE (V.O.) This is not the article I was sent in to write. This is the article I needed to write. I lived a lifetime of regret after my first high school experience, and now, after my second, my regrets are down to one. INTERIOR. SAM'S KITCHEN - MORNING The kitchen of a depressed guy--empty pizza boxes next to a dying plant. Sam pours milk into a bowl of Lucky Charms while he reads the Sports Section of the paper. JOSIE (V.O.) A certain teacher was trampled in my path to self-discovery, and though this article may serve as a step, it in no way makes up for what I did to him. He's not paying attention and the milk overflows the bowl, soaking the table. JOSIE (V.O.) (cont'd) To this man, you know who you are, I am so sorry. He takes the wet paper, using it like a sponge, he sops up the remaining milk, and throws the paper into an open trash can. He leaves the kitchen. WE HOLD ON the empty room. JOSIE (V.O.) (cont'd) And, I would like to add one more thing - I think I am in love with you. EXTERIOR. BASEBALL, STADIUM PARKING LOT  NIGHT Cars begin to fill the parking lot in a steady stream. JOSIE (V.O.) And so I propose this - as an ending to this article, and, perhaps, as an ending to this portion of my life. I, Josie Geller, will be at the State Championship baseball game  where my friends the Southglen Rams are playing for the title. EXTERIOR. BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT The Southglen Rams baseball team minus Rob, are on the field, warming up. JOSIE (V.O.) I will stand on the pitcher's mound for the five minutes prior to the first pitch. If this man accepts my apology, I ask him to come to kiss me, in front of everyone, for my first real kiss. We find a nervous looking Josie standing in the dugout. JOSIE (cont'd) Five minutes may seem like a short time, but trust me, when you've been waiting twenty-five years, it's usually the last five minutes that kill you. CU: THE PICTURE TAKEN OF JOSIE AND SAM AT THE PROM. JOSIE (V.O.) I went back to high school and discovered I was a loser, again. WIDEN TO REVEAL the picture on the fridge in-- INTERIOR. SAM'S KITCHEN - EVENING Sam enters, still in sweats, carrying a book. He opens the fridge, grabs a beer, shuts it, is confronted by Josie's picture. He takes it down, looks at it. JOSIE (V.O.) (cont'd) And then I discovered it wasn't so bad. I wasn't so bad. So, now that I'm ready to start living the rest of my life, it would be magical if I could live the rest of it with him. Sam lets the photo slowly drop from his hand into the trash. JOSIE (V.O.) (cont'd) Because inside everyone is a loser afraid to be loved, and out there is the one person who can kiss us and make it all better. WE FOLLOW Sam's stare down into the trash and see the photo lying on top and to the side of Josie's article--the photos from the article are clearly visible. ANGLE ON HOT DOGS, POPCORN CHANGING HANDS being sold by the truckload at the stadium. The crowds are over capacity. Way over. People fill the parking lot, they cover every other inch of school grounds, as well. They stand on the roofs of nearby buildings, they sit on top of their cars. It looks like most of Chicago is either already there, or on their way. Some WOMEN hold signs for Josie, others hold and wave her article. Josie sticks her head out of the dugout, and looks out at the fans. TV REPORTERS are everywhere, including several on the field. She looks like she may faint. She ducks back in. INTERIOR. DUGOUT - SAME The team is dressed, ready, excited. Anita and Aldys stand next to Josie. Josie looks up at the crowd, amazed. JOSIE Wow. It's packed. ANITA It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you. ALDYS It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it. JOSIE Well I'm so glad that you guys are. Josie then starts to hyperventilate. She puts her head between her ankles. Anita and Aldys both grab the brown paper bag and hand it to Josie. She hyperventilates into it. Coach Romano approaches. Josie puts the bag down. COACH Sweet Jesus, Geller - I had no idea there'd be all these TV crews here. This thing's gonna be on every station in the country. Josie immediately begins hyperventilating into the bag again. COACH You more than kept your end of the bargain. Now go out there and get 'em. Josie gets up and he slaps her on the ass. She hugs Aldys. Then Anita gives Josie a big hug, and won't let go. Josie has to pull Anita pulls back. Josie struggles to get out of the hug- Anita won't let her. Finally, they are both laughing. Josie walks out of the dugout, and onto the field. EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME She walks, alone, out to the pitcher's mound, clutching a microphone. The crowd goes berserk. She stands until they quiet. JOSIE Could I have five minutes on the clock, please? The scoreboard clock reads 5:00. Josie stands, alone. EXTERIOR. BOX SEATS  SAME The staff from the Sun Times sits in box seats up front. Rigfort joins them, carrying a huge load of hot dogs. RIGFORT I got weiners. Hot weiners. Rigfort sits next to Gus. Behind them sit Bruns, his hair finally growing in and Howard, now down to just a sling. RIGFORT I love this. Sun Times readers, out here, making a personal connection to one of our reporters. This is amazing, isn't it? Weiner? Gus takes a weiner. GUS Yeah, it is. RIGFORT (studying his weiner) Wait a minute... Rigfort pulls something small and shiny out of the bun. RIGFORT (cont'd) There's a bolt in my weiner. Then he turns back to Howard and smiles. RIGFORT (cont'd) Hey Howard, what are you doing for the next month? Howard's face falls. EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME Josie still stands there. The clock is down to 2:30. She looks over to the dugout. EXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME The Denominators talking and laughing. Behind them, sit the Marching Band EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND  SAME Josie forces-a stoic smile. 1:00 is on the clock. EXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME The cool crowd. Guy, Kirsten and the gang. They are trying start the wave, but its not working. EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME The clock reads: 20. EXTERIOR. BOX SEATS - SAME The Sun Times box. Anita clutches Gus's hand for dear life has her eyes squeezed tight. The crowd keeps chanting. EXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME Everyone - including all the Denominators are on their feet, chanting. Aldys cheers the loudest. EXTERIOR. STANDS - SAME The women are on their feet, chanting. EXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME Guy and the Gang are on their feet. EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME Josie stands, clutching the mic. The clock reads: 10. CROWD TEN - NINE - EIGHT - SEVEN - SIX - Josie stands there, head still held high. CROWD FIVE - FOUR - THREE - TWO - Josie steals a look to the dugout. No one is coming out the door. CROWD ONE!! Josie makes one more desperate look around. No one is running toward her. CLOSE UP on Josie, completely crestfallen. She drops the microphone. It reverbs in the silent stadium. WE PAN ACROSS the Crowd, all defeated. And then... A commotion in the stands. Sam bursts through the crowd. He runs toward the mound. The Crowd is on their feet. It feels like a lifetime before he reaches Josie, grabs her, pulls her close to him. SAM I told you you could write, Josie Geller. JOSIE I finally found my story. And they kiss passionately. The most amazing, most waited-for kiss in the history of man. A kiss that will last forever. INTERIOR. DUGOUT - SAME Rob is in his baseball uniform, cheering up a storm. Across his chest is emblazoned: "ASSISTANT COACH". EXTERIOR. BOX SEATS - SAME Anita is so thrilled, she reaches over and plants a big one on Gus. She is surprised. So is he. They like it. EXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME The Denominators and Aldys cheer their brains out. EXTERIOR. BLEACHERS - SAME Guy, Kirsten, etc. have finally succeeded in starting the wave. EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME MUSIC UP: The Beach Boys "And Then I Kissed Her" as Josie and Sam continue to kiss as the CAMERA PULLS UP, taking in the kiss, the Crowd, the stadium... CAMERA SPINS UP as FIREWORKS go off above the stadium... And we watch as the stadium becomes a speck against the glittering backdrop of Chicago. FADE OUT. The End
THE NEXT THREE DAYS

1   INT. SUV -- DAY                                                 1

    No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA,
    unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
    collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
    something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:

                       THE LAST THREE YEARS

2   INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       2

    Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
    LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN           
    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          
    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        
    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.                

                           LARA
               You know what? If you were smart
               you would stop talking right now.

                           ERIT
               Sue me. I just know that women should                     
               never work for women.

    John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head.                    

                           LARA
               How can you say that??

                           ERIT
               They're always threatened. Especially
               if you're beautiful and they're not.

                           LARA
               Erit, you are so full of shit.

                           ERIT
               So, your boss isn't threatened by
               you?


                                                (CONTINUED)
                                                               2.

2   CONTINUED:                                                       2

                             LARA
                 Because she's a bitch! --
                     (as John and Mick laugh)                             
                 --Not because she's a woman.

                             ERIT
                 And you would describe her as
                 "attractive"?

                             LARA
                 That has nothing to do with it!

                             ERIT
                 And there is my answer.

                             JOHN
                 Either of you like another drink?

    Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.

                             ERIT
                 Women should work under men, men
                 under women. That's it.

                             JOHN
                     (egging her on)
                 But men under men?

                             ERIT
                 That's fine, too.
                     (the men burst into laughter)
                 They're used to it! Why are you
                 laughing?

                             MICK                                         
                     (re: Erit)
                 I don't know, bro, but I think I'd
                 rather work under you than her.

                             ERIT
                     (insulted, shoots back)
                 Oh please, I'd rather work under
                 him, too.

    That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.                

                             LARA
                 You'd rather "work under" John?

                             ERIT                                         
                 You have a problem with that, too?                       



                                                 (CONTINUED)
                                                                   3.

                             LARA                                            
                 No, why would I have a problem with                         
                 your little sexual innuendo?                                

                             ERIT                                            
                 What is up your ass tonight??

    Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is                 
    going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.                  

                             LARA
                 So, I shouldn't take offense that
                 you're coming on to my husband right                        
                 in front of me.                                             

                             ERIT
                     (claws out now)
                 Lara, if I wanted your husband I
                 would have him.

                             LARA
                 How? You couldn't possibly show him
                 more of your tits.

    The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.

                             ERIT
                 -- You know what your problem is?!

              JOHN                             MICK                          
      That was a great meal!           Okay--okay!

3   EXT. STEAK HOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               3

    Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup.     John and             
    Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.

                             JOHN
                 She is completely full of shit.

                             LARA
                 DON'T try and agree with me now.

                             JOHN
                 You know what? I don't even believe
                 she is in the dental profession.

    Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her
    black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.

                             LARA
                 Shut up.

                             JOHN
                 I bet she can't even spell
                 anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete
                 fraud.

                             LARA
                 We went to her office party, idiot.

                             JOHN
                 I think she hit on me that night,
                 too.

    Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in
    the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....

                             LARA
                 You are completely delusional. She
                 wasn't even hitting on you in there;
                 I just don't like her.

                             JOHN
                 I understand. People who look like
                 that should not be allowed anywhere
                 near oral surgery.

    She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it
    away.

                             LARA
                 You are such an asshole.

                             JOHN
                 You're in the chair trying to stay
                 calm; how are you supposed to do that
                 with those things hanging over your--

    She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she
    stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip
    under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 Someone's going to --

    Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and
    it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.

    After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors.
    She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.

4   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT                            4

    Lara and John enter, Lara carrying her raincoat, her hair
    sticking up in the back, John's shirt untucked.

                               LARA
                 Hello!

    JENNA, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them.

                               LARA (CONT'D)
                 Did he cry?

                             JENNA
                 Only when I dropped him down the                                
                 stairs.                                                         

    Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.

5   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY                                   5

    She peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly.

6   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                              6

    Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna. John nods for
    her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.

                              JOHN
                 Thanks.   See you next weekend.

    Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out.
    John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses
    him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again.
    He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.

7   INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                   7

    Lara wakes, troubled.      It's the middle of the night.

8   INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT                                               8

    Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked. She locks it
    and looks out. Satisfied, she sits and watches her son sleep.

9   INT.    KITCHEN -- MORNING                                              9

    Three year-old LUKE holds a knife and fork as he sits at the
    table watching his dad cut up his pancakes.

                             JOHN
                 Okay, your turn.

    Luke skewers a piece with his fork.        Lara passes, hustling
    to get to work.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 Very good, very good...

    Luke puts it in his mouth.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 No, no, no; you feed me.
                     (to Lara)
                 Your son is hopeless.

    Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo.

                             LARA
                 Squeeze in tight.

                             JOHN
                 You can't do this every morning.   It
                 is way too corny.

                              LARA
                 Smile.   It's just until he's eighteen.

    It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric
    toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go.

                              LARA (CONT'D)
                 Present.

                             JOHN
                     (examining it)
                 Sweetie, you have to stop believing
                 everything you read in a catalogue.

                             LARA
                 You hate brushing your teeth; this
                 one brushes them in thirty seconds.

                             JOHN
                     (as if stung)
                 I love brushing my teeth.
                     (to Luke)
                 The lies your mother tells.

                             LARA
                     (ignoring him)
                 When's your last class?

                             JOHN
                 Three, and I have papers to grade.
                 Can you pick up Luke?

                             LARA
                 After yesterday I probably don't
                 have a job anyway. Do you think it
                 was wrong to call her a useless cow?

                  Bosses admire that kind of frank                         
                  exchange.

                  Did you call your father?

                              JOHN
                  When?

                              LARA
                      (heading for bathroom)
                  "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!

10   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM                                   10

     Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin.

                              JOHN (O.S.)
                  I sent him flowers and a handmade
                  card.

                              LARA
                  You're completely impossible.

                              JOHN (O.S.)
                  Did you notice what I got for my
                  birthday this year? A grunt.

11   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                    11

                              JOHN
                  Mom said Happy Birthday and my father
                  went . Made me tear up.

     Lara returns, trying hard not to smile.

 LARA                   Ever think that someone has to be
                  the bigger person here?

 JOHN                       (to Luke)
                  Remember this for the custody hearing:
                  how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.

 LARA                   How are you going to feel if Luke
                  grows up and doesn't call you?

     Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer.

 JOHN                   Now she's driving a wedge between us.

 LARA                   I give up.

 JOHN                   And now she is abandoning you.

     Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back
     shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.

12 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 12 
     Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it
     run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings.

13 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 13 
     John rises to answer the door.

14 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 14 
     Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood
     on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it.

15 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 15 
     As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge.
     DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John
     has no time to react.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                   Police.   Mr. Brennan?

     LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared.

 DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)                   My name is Detective Quinn. This is
                  a search warrant for these premises.

     John hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside.

 DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)                       (stops him)
                  Stay where you are.

 JOHN                   Get your --

 DETECTIVE QUINN                   Touch me again and you'll be arrested.

16 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWN THE HALL 16 
     Lara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero.
     She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member,
     who takes it and bags it under:

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                 Lara Brennan?

 LARA WHAT?! 
 DETECTIVE COLLERO                 Lara Brennan, you are under arrest
                for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.

     She takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her.

 LARA                 She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead??

17 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 17 
 JOHN                     (tries to push past)
                She didn't do anything!

 DETECTIVE QUINN                 I will only --

 JOHN                     (tries again)
                She didn't do anything!

 DETECTIVE QUINN                 Put him in cuffs.

     The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his
     wrists. John watches as his child cries, his wife is led
     out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart. Cut to BLACK.

18 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 18 
 LUKE (O.S.)                 Daddy!...    DADDY!!

     A light comes on.   John steps out of his bedroom and enters
     his son's room.

 JOHN (O.S.)                 It's okay.     Just a bad dream.

     He comes back out carrying Luke, now SIX YEARS-OLD.
 10. 


19 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 19 
     John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him.

 JOHN                   You okay?

     Luke nods.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Okay, you can sleep here as long as
                  you stay on this side of the bed.

     Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   You're such a snake, I don't know why
                  I keep falling for the same trick.

     John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow.

     John reaches for the lamp. Beside it sits the framed photo
     that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning.
     He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes BLACK.

20 EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY 20 
     The "T," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from
     underground and we CRANE UP to see the city.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   But Sam's your friend, right?

21 EXT. ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL -- DAY 21 
     Tilt down from a passing T-Train to find John and Luke,
     walking toward the huge, modern Allegheny County Jail.

 LUKE                   Not at lunch.

 JOHN                   Does he take your food?

 LUKE                   No.

 JOHN                   Did he say something mean?
                      (Luke nods)
                  About Mommy?

 LUKE                   Yeah.

 JOHN                   Did you hit him?

 LUKE                   Yeah.

 JOHN                   Good.    Where did you hit him?

 LUKE                   Near the swings.

 JOHN                   Wow.    I bet that hurt.

 LUKE                   Yeah.

22 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 22 
     - John waits in a long line, mostly women. He glances over
     at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and
     sees children playing. Luke plays by himself.

     - John puts his key ring in a plastic container. The guard
     takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
     John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
     through and the buzzer goes off.

     John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him
     with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal
     detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something
     from his pocket, looks at it curiously.

 JOHN                   It's a toy!

     The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech.
     The guard waves John through. No beep. John kneels and
     pulls on Luke's jacket.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Don't worry.     We'll get it back.

23 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 23 
     They walk along the hall with all the other visitors.
 12. 


24 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 24 
     John stares out the window at the city beyond.    Life seems
     so close.

     He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
     round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
     are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
     of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.

     The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
     prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.

     Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
     hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
     and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
     who plays with his back to her.

 LARA                 Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?
                    (no response. Tickles him)
                Come on, give Mommy a kiss.

 JOHN                 Rat-Bag.   Give Mommy a kiss.

     He gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his Legos.

 LARA                 Is Daddy reading you my letters?

 JOHN                 Every night at bedtime.

 LARA                 What are you building?    A fort?

     Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head
     and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand.

 LARA (CONT'D)                 Was he scared going to school?

 JOHN                 I walked him to class, gave him a kiss;
                he didn't even look back to wave.

 LARA                 What did you make him for lunch?

 JOHN                   Turkey sandwich, just butter and
                  bread, no "vegetables" on it. He
                  swore he ate his apple.

     He hands her a pack of photos.      Lara devours them.

 LARA                   Look at his friends.   And his desk.
                  This is his teacher?

 JOHN                   Miss Phillips.

 LARA                   You may have to move to another school
                  district.

 JOHN                   Already spoke to a realtor.

 LARA                       (still looking at photos)
                  How was your first day?

 JOHN                   Excellent. Over half my class stayed
                  awake. Talked to your mom.

 LARA                   When is she coming?

 JOHN                   She's having a lot of trouble with
                  her business.

 LARA                   It's only been a couple of years,
                  I'm sure she'll get around to it.
                      (beat)
                  Have you heard anything?

 JOHN                   About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just
                  not telling you. What did Meyer
                  say?

 LARA                   --Don't--

 JOHN                   -- It can take months for the court
                  to rule.

 LARA                   I saw that woman. She was there.
                  She couldn't have just disappeared.

 JOHN                   Meyer's looking for a new
                  investigator.

 LARA                   Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a
                  button pop - they must have been
                  blind not to find it.

 JOHN                   He'll go through all the evidence
                  again.

 LARA                   Great, because I haven't quite
                  bankrupted us yet.

 JOHN                   We're doing fine.

 LARA                       (fondly)
                  You just lie and lie.
                      (strokes his face)
                  But you are very handsome.
                      (admiring him)
                  Can you do me a favor?

 JOHN                   I don't know, I'm a little busy.

 LARA                   I need you to run for governor.

 JOHN                   -- Oh, that I can do.

 LARA                   You can change this rule about no
                  conjugal visits, because I don't
                  think I can last another twenty years.

     She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place.    He
     reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   I'm okay.   I'm okay.

 JOHN                   I know. But it's going to be fine.
                  I promise.

     She just stares at Luke, his back to them, playing.

 LARA                   You think he'll ever want to kiss me
                  again?

25 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER 25 
     The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and
     blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other
     visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room.

26 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 26 
     Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump-
     suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for
     contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls
     it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.

27 INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT 27 
     Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke           
     standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a             
     complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the
     toilet, staring at his watch.

 JOHN                   Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

     Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Good?

     Luke nods.

28 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING 28 
     The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it.
     John backs out, Luke in his child seat. He brakes and finds
     PAULA, the woman who lives behind them, at his window.

 PAULA                   How's Lara?

 JOHN                   She's doing okay.



 (CONTINUED) 16. 
28 CONTINUED: 28 
 PAULA                   Tell her we're pulling for her.

 JOHN                   I will.

     She holds up a plastic water bottle.

 PAULA                   They won't recycle these unless you
                  take off the cap.
                      (cap vs. bottle)
                  This is trash. This is recyclable.

 JOHN                   Ok.   Thanks.

     John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in.

29 EXT. PARK -- DAY 29 
     Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash
     over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.

 JOHN                   Luke!   Let's go, Toad.   Come on.

     Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't
     notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching
     him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.

 NICOLE                   Time to go, Carrie!

     John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand,
     arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who
     heads to retrieve her daughter. John walks off with Luke.

30 INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY 30 
     John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out
     with a young associate. He spots John and approaches.

 MEYER                   John, I said my office at four
                  o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --

 JOHN                       (holds up a Subway bag)
                  I figured you had to eat.

     Meyer relents, turns and calls to his associate.


 (CONTINUED) 17. 
30 CONTINUED: 30 
 MEYER                   Do you have the ruling in Brennan?

     She kneels and digs through her rolling briefcase.

31 INT. COURTROOM -- A SHORT TIME LATER 31 
     John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the
     ruling. The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at
     his desk. During this he gets up and walks out past them.

 JOHN                   But what if we find the woman who                        
                  was leaving the parking lot?                             

 MEYER                   The PCRA was rejected. No new
                  evidence can be submitted. Not
                  anymore.

 JOHN                   It was a robbery!   Someone stole her
                  purse!

 MEYER                   And if they'd used her credit cards
                  we would have had something to argue.
                  I'm sorry; this really...sucks.

     John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words.

 JOHN                   So, that's it. Now we just have the
                  Supreme Court.

 MEYER                   John, in the last thirty years, the
                  Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder
                  case. No decent lawyer would even
                  file the pleadings.

 JOHN                   So, I need to find an indecent one?

 MEYER                   No, I'm going to file it. But I
                  need you to do something for me.

 JOHN                   Anything.




 (CONTINUED) 18. 
31 CONTINUED: 31 
 MEYER                   I need you to look at the evidence
                  and just forget Lara is your wife.

 JOHN                       (stopped by that)
                  I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

 MEYER                   I'm not saying judge her innocent or
                  guilty, I'm just saying look at it.                        
                  He co-worker sees her leaving the                          
                  scene, she has the victim's blood on                       
                  her clothes, her fingerprints on the
                  murder weapon--

 JOHN                       (is this a bad joke?)
                  We went out for dinner! How do you
                  do that after you kill somebody?
                  She would have to be a psychopath!

 MEYER                   -- And the fight in the office.

 JOHN                   Everyone fights with their boss!

 MEYER                   But this one ended up dead.

     John looks at Meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed.

 JOHN                   So, you never believed she was
                  innocent?

 MEYER                   How can you say that?

 JOHN                   So, what are you saying, Meyer?!

 MEYER                   That it no longer matters what we
                  believe; Lara's not getting out.
                  And you have no idea how much I hate
                  saying that.

 JOHN                       (exiting)
                  I'll find someone to file the
                  pleadings.

 MEYER                   John! Come on! For Christ's sake.
 JOHN!! 
     John is long gone.    Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash.

32 INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- DAY 32 
     John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The
     door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles
     and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face
     and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him.

     John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up
     her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his
     face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably.

     John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears
     run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her
     phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder --
     desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it.

     He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention
     of the guard on his side.

     Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but
     she can't hear it, and neither can we.

33 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 33 
     We're in an old working class neighborhood.    John sits in
     his car, trying to pull himself together.

34 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 34 
     MICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from                   
     clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything
     they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door.                  

     In the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to
     see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away,
     uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention.

35 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- LATE AFTERNOON 35 
     John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the                 
     back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their
     empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and
     George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John:

 ERIT                   I know you won't want to hear this...

35 CONTINUED: 35 
 MICK                   -- Erit, go put somebody to sleep.

     She stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff.

 JOHN                   Thanks.

 MICK                   Had to be done.
                      (long beat)
                  I am really going to pay for that.

     John has to smile.

36 EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT (DUSK) 36 
     John drives through a rough part of town on their way home.
     He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A
     flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID.
     He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches
     John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off.

37 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 37 
     John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and
     photographs. As John sifts through the evidence...

38 INT. LARA'S OFFICE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 38 
     Lara and her boss ELIZABETH argue loudly.

39 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 39 
     It's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a
     small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She
     turns toward camera --

     A FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible
     impact and

     ELIZABETH collapses to the floor.

40 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 40 
     Lara turns, holding the fire extinguisher.

41 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 41 
     As he flips through a handwritten witness statement.

42 EXT. PARKING LOT - THE PAST -- NIGHT 42 
     Lara's car speeds out of the parking lot. A male co-worker            
     steps out of the rain just as her car passes. He stops as             
     he sees ELIZABETH'S BODY lying beside her car.

43 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM - THE PAST -- DAY 43 
     Lara tries to scrub the blood off of her coat.

44 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 44 
     The phone beside him SHRIEKS.   John picks it up.

45 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- NIGHT 45 
     It's late; prime time for the ER.    John runs in.

46 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR -- NIGHT 46 
     John enters breathlessly and finds the Nurses' Station.

 JOHN                 Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent                        
                up here. Brennan. B-R-                                     

 DUTY NURSE                     (finds name in roster)                                 
                She can't have visitors.

 JOHN                 That's ridiculous; I have to see                           
                her.

 DUTY NURSE                 I'm sorry.

     John turns away and heads down the corridor to find her
     himself. The Duty Nurse sees this and takes off after him:

 DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)                 You can't go down there!

     John shoves open a door, moves on to the next.

 DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)                 You can't be in here!!

 JOHN                 Lara!

                  I got him!

 JOHN                   Lara!

     A long-haired doctor, BECSEY, steps into his path.

 DR. BECSEY                   What's going on?!

 JOHN                   My wife attempted suicide.

 HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE        Let's go.                                (hands doctor chart)
                                              She's not allowed visitors.

 JOHN                   I have to see her!

 DR. BECSEY                   Why isn't she in the ER?

 HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE        I'm not asking. Now.                   She's a transfer from County
                                              Jail.

 JOHN                   Please.   Two minutes.

     Becsey is not unmoved.       He shares a look with the nurse.

47 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM -- NIGHT 47 
     DR. Becsey opens the door for John.          Note a prison guard
     standing outside.

 DR. BECSEY                   Two minutes.

     Becsey leaves. A uniformed female prison guard looks up
     from her magazine and keeps her eyes on John. He looks to
     his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and
     weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery.

     Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something
     terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels
     beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little
     finger, wraps her fingers around it.
 WHITE 9-10-09 23. 


48 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT 48 
     John opens the door to let Jenna out; she looks considerably
     older.

 JENNA                  I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending
                 he's asleep.

 JOHN                      (reaching for his wallet)                             
                 Don't worry about it.

 JENNA                  It's okay.

 JOHN                  I insist.    I kept you out on a school
                 night.

 JENNA                  I'm not in school anymore.

     She offers a sad smile and leaves without the cash.

49 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 49 
     Luke lies in the crook of his father's arm, his own arms
     full of penguins, turtles, a black dog and an opossum. John
     reads him a letter, the yellow envelope open on the bed.

 JOHN                  And give a big hug to Pengui, Little
                 Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley,
                 Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of
                 love, Mommy.
                     (beat)
                 You gonna give them hugs from her?

                 Should we write her back?                                 

 LUKE                  ...When is she coming home?

 JOHN                  Soon honey.    Soon.

 LUKE                      (thinks for a moment, then:)                          
                 Can I have a quarter?

 JOHN                  Can you have a quarter?

     Luke points at the glass coin dish on night stand.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend
                  those. They come from the cottage
                  where Mommy and I used to take you
                  when you were a baby.

 LUKE                   Then can I have them all?

 JOHN                   ...Sure.

     He hands Luke the jar, and hoists up him and his animals.

50 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 50 
     Luke sets the coin jar on his nightstand. John tucks him in
     with his animals, then switches off the lamp. John looks
     back before closing it and watches Luke lie awake, staring
     at the jar, lost in confused thoughts of his mother.

51 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT 51 
     Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher.
     He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He
     places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer
     crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages
     through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls
     handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on
     the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes
     frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the
     counter, feeling destroyed and needy.

     And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another
     drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to
     move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue,
     places it on the counter and moves away.

     John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and
     shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.

     Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then
     suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No
     sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts
     into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He
     flings it open...

52 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 52 
     John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her --
     finally realizing she was never there.

 (CONTINUED) 25.

     He stands in the middle of the street, now searching for some
     way to survive.

53 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY 53 
     Don Quixote is written on the chalkboard.

 JOHN                   So, what is it about?   Julie?

 JULIE                   That belief in someone's virtue is
                  more important than virtue itself?

 JOHN                   No. I mean, yes, that's in there.
                  But what is it about?

     No takers.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   It is about how rational thought
                  destroys the soul. It is about the
                  triumph of irrationality, and the
                  power that is in it.

54 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY 54 
     John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each
     having something to do with prison or prison life.

     He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at
     a time and discards each in turn.

     As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer
     screen linked to the school system.

     ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by
     the school search engine -- many of the items have already
     been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls."              

     He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author
     is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption
     reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY.

55 EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - STREET -- DAY 55 
     John gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar.

56 INT. BAR -- DAY 56 
     A couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV               
     screen. DAMON hands John a beer and nods toward a table.

 JOHN                   It's a course that investigates what
                  drives men to be free, no matter the
                  cost.

 DAMON                   Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?

 JOHN                   You escaped from jail seven times.                           

     Damon lights a cigarette.       A TOUGH GUY nearby objects.

 TOUGH GUY                   No smoking!!

 DAMON                   Yeah, who would want to cut short
                  your precious life?

     Damon takes a deep drag.

 JOHN                   Mind if I tape you?

 DAMON                   Go for it, it can't be used as
                  evidence. What do you want to know?

     John sets up the small digital recorder.

 JOHN                   How you escaped when no one else
                  could.

 DAMON                   Balls and a little luck.
                      (beat)
                  No prison in the world is airtight.
                  Each one has a key. You have to
                  find it.

 JOHN                   How do you do that?

 DAMON                   A lot of looking. Especially at
                  things that break the daily routine.
                  Guards get comfortable doing the
                  same thing every day. Something
                  happens where they have to think,
                  adapt.

 DAMON (CONT'D)                   That's when they will make mistakes.
                  But when you see it you have to be
                  ready. You have to have the entire
                  plan already in place before you
                  even know how you are going to get
                  out of the jail.
                  Escaping is easy; the hardest part
                  is staying free.

57 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 57 
     The tape recorder plays Damon's voice; John tears large sheets
     of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You have to know where you are going
                  to go and how you are going to get
                  there. You have to know how they
                  plan to catch you, where, and when.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   How the hell do you know that?

     He starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You pay off someone who knows. And
                  a lot depends on if the prison is in
                  the country or the city.

58 INT. BAR -- DAY 58 
 JOHN                   The city.

     That came out too quickly. Damon now understands. John
     sits, silent, knowing he blew it. Damon takes his time.

 DAMON                   Where are you from?

 JOHN                   ...Pittsburgh.

 DAMON                   Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges
                  and tunnels they can block off.

59 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 59 
     The art paper bunches and rips under the pressure of the
     marker. John tears it off the wall.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   From the time they make the call,
                  the police can have the center of
                  the city sealed tight in fifteen
                  minutes.

60 INT. BAR -- DAY 60 
 JOHN                   How can they be so exact?

 DAMON                   After 9-11 Homeland Security made
                  every city have a lock-down plan --
                  downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston,
                  Minneapolis -- fifteen minutes.
                  They can do DC in under ten.

61 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 61 
     John draws a circle on the wall and writes in it: 15 MINUTES --

 DAMON (O.S.)                   Within thirty-five minutes they will
                  have cops at every tollbooth on the
                  interstate --

     -- Surrounds it by a larger circle: 35 MINUTES.

62 INT. BAR -- DAY 62 
 DAMON                   And be running rolling stops on the
                  secondary roads. They won't have
                  your photograph yet, but they will
                  have your description.

63 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 63 
     He draws spokes out from the circles.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   What if you can't make it out?

64 INT. BAR -- DAY 64 
 JOHN                   Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of
                  time.

 DAMON                   Then surrender.

 DAMON (CONT'D)                   Because they will shoot you on sight,
                  along with anyone you are with.

65 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 65 
     John writes DESCRIPTION at the end of one spoke.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   Stay far away from the train and bus
                  stations.

66 INT. BAR -- DAY 66 
 DAMON                   Forget the local airports.   Leave
                  from another state.

67 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 67 
     John scribbles key words on the wall.     DISTANT AIRPORT.

68 INT. BAR -- DAY 68 
 DAMON                   Second: identity. It's easy to find
                  fake papers, harder to find ones
                  that will get you through an airport.

69 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 69 
     John writes "IDENTITIES."

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You'll need a passport, driver's
                  license and a social security number.

70 INT. BAR -- DAY 70 
 DAMON                   If you have to rent a car, find a
                  place that will take a cash deposit.
                  They'll still run a credit check, so
                  use a real person's name on the ID.
                      (beat)
                  Third: destination.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You want somewhere that doesn't
                  attract American tourists and doesn't
                  get American newspapers. Think Yemen
                  and you get the idea.

72 INT. BAR -- DAY 72 
 DAMON                   Then money.

73 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 73 
     John's writes "MONEY."

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You need a truck load of it.
                  Everything's expensive: hotels,
                  travel, information.

74 INT. BAR -- DAY 74 
 JOHN                   How much?

 DAMON                   Enough to last at least five-six
                  years. Run out of money and you run
                  out of friends.

75 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 75 
     John underlines "MONEY."

76 INT. BAR -- DAY 76 
     John is starting to understand the enormity of this
     undertaking.

 DAMON                   But before you do anything, you have
                  to ask yourself if you can do it.
                  Can you forget about ever seeing
                  your parents again. Can you kill a
                  guard, leave your kid at a gas
                  station, push a nice old lady to the
                  ground because she is between you
                  and the door? Because to do this
                  thing, that's who you have to become.
                  And if you can't, don't start, because
                  you'll just get someone killed.

77 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 77 
     John backs away from the wall to see it covered in a spiderweb
     of notes.

 JOHN (O.S.)                 How did you get caught?

78 INT. BAR -- DAY 78 
 DAMON                 I gave myself up. I couldn't take
                wondering when someone was going to
                come through the bedroom door.
                    (beat)
                Got what you need?

 JOHN                 Yeah.

 DAMON                 What do you have in your pocket?

     John opens his billfold.   Damon takes the cash, leaves him a          
     twenty.                                                                

79 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 79 
     On the wall we see the massive diagram John has created.
     The screen goes BLACK. Read:

 THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
80 EXT. T-TRAIN -- DAY 80 
     The train crosses a bridge.

81 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 81 
     John rides, looking down at the river below.

82 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 82 
     John steps through the puffer (the machine that detects drugs)
     and into the secure area. He makes a mental note of
     everything he sees: the number of guards, cameras, etc.

83 EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DELIVERY AREA -- DAY 83 
     John sits in his car on the road above, surreptitiously taking
     pictures of the vehicles coming and going from the prison.

84 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 84 
     He tapes the photos to the wall.

85 INT. COUNTY JAIL -- DAY 85 
     Walking down a corridor with the other visitors, John steps
     in a puddle of water. Behind him the others notice and step
     around it. Moving on, they pass a trustee on a ladder pulling
     a water-stained ceiling tile away as two guards watch.

86 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 86 
     John traces a route on a map with a highlighter.

87 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY (NEW DAY) 87 
     The wall grows thick with photos and notes.

88 INT. CLASSROOM -- NEW DAY 88 
     He reads an article on his computer -- about illegal aliens
     and fake ID's.

89 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 89 
     John enters his bedroom and closes the door. We see how
     dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch
     is covered in notes, photos, maps, and various writings. He
     studies it as he bites into a sandwich.

90 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 90 
     John and Luke walk near the front of the group of visitors
     toward the visitation rooms.

     Just ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the
     elevator. John stops near the elevator and kneels, pulling
     one of Luke's shoelaces loose.

 LUKE                 It was already tied.

     John reties the lace as the group moves on.    He keeps one
     eye on the elevator.

     The door opens and the guard   steps in - and John notices two
     WORKMEN in hardhats inside.    The elevator closes, the shoelace
     is tied, the group has moved   on down the hall and they are
     alone. John pulls the laces    and unties Luke's shoe.

 LUKE (CONT'D)                 You untied it again!

90 CONTINUED: 90 
     The guard looks back, now impatient. John offers a smile
     and throws a look down at the elevator tread, sees the name:
     OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY. Suddenly a voice comes from behind:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                   Mr. Brennan?

     Startled, John turns to see DR. LIFSON.

 DR. LIFSON                   We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.

 JOHN                   Oh, sorry.    Hello, Doctor.

 DR. LIFSON                       (to approaching guard)
                  I'll bring them back myself.                              

91 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CLINIC -- DAY 91 
     John leaves Luke playing and steps into the office. Lifson             
     partially closes the door, so John can still see his son.              

 DR. LIFSON                   We check your wife's blood regularly.
                  She's been refusing her insulin. I
                  don't want to sound dramatic, but
                  it's just another form of suicide.

 JOHN                   I'll talk to her.

 DR. LIFSON                   If she doesn't --                                         

 JOHN                   I'll talk to her.

92 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 92 
     John and Luke wait. The prisoners enter.      Lara looks
     terrible. John stands and embraces her.

 JOHN                   Hey. Are you alright?

     is engrossed in his toys as usual.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?

     He doesn't respond. She kisses him on the head then takes a
     seat. John sits beside her. They speak in whispers.

 JOHN                   The doctor told me about the insulin.

 LARA                       (watching Luke)
                  Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.

 JOHN                   You forgot?    For how many days?

 LARA                   I forgot, okay? I have things on my
                  mind.

 JOHN                   --And so much to do.

 LARA                   Oh, that's nice.

 JOHN                   Why are you doing this?

 LARA                   Can I please just watch him play?
                  Tell me about kindergarten.

 JOHN                   No.   I need you to --

 LARA                   Fine, I won't forget again, okay?
                      (trying to fight away these
                       thoughts:)
                  I am just never going to walk him to
                  school or wash his clothes or make
                  him dinner...and I don't know how I
                  can live knowing that. Okay?

 LARA                       (cruelly - but hushed)
                  What? What is going to happen?
                  There are no more appeals, there are
                  no more anything. Exactly what
                  miracle are we hoping for, John?

     He looks down, beaten.      She lets go of her anger.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   I need you to do something for me.

 JOHN                   Sure.

 LARA                   Stop bringing him.                                         

 JOHN                   Come on...

 LARA                   He hates coming here.   Look at him.

 JOHN                   Lara....

 LARA                   Please. It's not his fault. It's                           
                  too hard to watch him forget me.

     John looks at his son, playing at a distance, his back to
     them. It's hard to argue with her, she's right.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   You want to hear something funny?

 JOHN                   Yes.    Anything.

 LARA                   My mother tried to send me anti-aging
                  cream.

     John smiles, but like hers it may be the saddest smile in
     the world. They sit and watch Luke play.

93 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 93 
     John checks his bank statements and adds them up on the wall
     under MONEY. The total is $8,840.00.

     He stares at that figure for a moment.

     appropriate one to use for Lara's ID. Some of them are of
     the family at a cottage. He finds one that will work and
     starts to crop himself and Luke (as a baby) out of the photo.
     Then he turns and notices Luke standing behind him, staring
     at the screen.

97 EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY 97 
     A helicopter swoops over a bridge and traces the Monongahela
     River through the city. On the door of the helicopter is
     emblazoned the name of a local tour company.

98 INT. HELICOPTER -- DAY 98 
     John sits among six other passengers.

 COPTER PILOT                 On the left, Allegheny County Jail.
                Built in 1995, it is now the largest                        
                jail in the world. There have been                          
                three escape attempts. No one's                             
                made it out alive. On your right...                         

     Everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues.
     John stays fixed on the left window.

 HIS POINT OF VIEW: 
     The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly
     what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread
     hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a
     bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof.

99 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CLASSROOM -- DAY 99 
      LYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his
      desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google
      Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle.
      John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed
      color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the
      outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR.

 LYLA                  On the first landing, which was as
                 small as the necessary turn of the
                 stairs allowed, there was a niche in
                 the column, about a yard wide, and
                 in this niche the prince felt
                 convinced that a man stood concealed.
                 He thought he could distinguish a
                 figure standing there.

100 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 100 
      John searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS. Clicks on
      one that reads EXPERIENCED HELICOPTER PILOT, COMBAT VET,
 WILL CONSIDER ANY OFFER. 
 ANGLE ON JOHN'S WALL 
      Where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the
      heading ESCAPE. Overlapping it he pins trimmed print-outs
      of several PILOT candidates.

      Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop
      of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing
      site indicated with an X in a circle.

      Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the
      adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In
      block letters beside it is the word "KEY?"

101 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 101 
      Luke, John and George stand in the foyer, Luke with his child-
      sized, brightly-colored overnight bag. John pulls off Luke's
      coat, kisses him on the head and looks up at George.

 JOHN                  Thanks.

      George nods, takes Luke's hand and walks to the kitchen.

102 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 102 
      John drives, taking note of the corners where young men hang
      out, selling drugs or contraband.

103 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 103 
      John walks up to a guy leaning on the bumper of his car, the            
      trunk partially open. Call him MOUSS.                                   

 JOHN                  Adderall?

 MOUSS                  Ten apiece, five for forty.

      John hands him a twenty, Mouss digs into a bag in his trunk             
      and hands him a blister-pack strip of two pills, samples.               

 JOHN                  I need some passports.

 MOUSS                  Piss off.

      John nods and walks back across the street.   The guy watches.

104 INT. CAR -- NIGHT 104 
      John climbs into his car and tosses the pills onto the
      passenger seat, among a half dozen others. There is a sharp
      RAP on his window; Mouss. John rolls down the window.

 MOUSS                  You have to pay up front.

 JOHN                  I can do that.

 MOUSS                  You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?

 JOHN                  No.

 MOUSS                  Ask for Harv.

 JOHN                  What's your name?

 MOUSS                  Just say Mouss.
 39. 


105 EXT. UPTOWN LOUNGE - 5TH AVENUE -- NIGHT 105 
      John parks and steps out of his car.

106 INT. UPTOWN LOUNGE -- NIGHT 106 
      Hip-hop blares, the clientele are low-lives, John doesn't
      exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned
      out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for
      "Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is
      playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED             
      GUY at the bar who watches him. John approaches HARV.                   

 JOHN                  Mouss said to come see you.

 HARV                  He did, did he? What do you want?                            

 JOHN                  Three passports, a driver's license,
                 and real social security number.

 HARV                  How do you know Mouss?

 JOHN                  He babysits my kid.

 HARV                      (sizes him up, then:)                                    
                 Okay.                                                        

      Harv gives him a look; nods for him to follow.                          

107 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - PARKING LOT BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT 107 
      They step out the back door.

 HARV                  You have the photos on you?

 JOHN                  Yes.   How much?

 HARV                  Fifteen hundred.

      MOUSS steps out of the shadows and cracks John across the
      back of the head with a pipe. John stumbles to the ground.

      The two men kick the shit out of John.   John tries to protect
      his face; they just keep kicking.

 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 40. 
107 CONTINUED: 107 
      Mouss finally grabs John's hair and flicks a knife in his
      face as Harv searches his pockets and finds his money.

 MOUSS                    I ever see you again, you lose an                            
                   eye.                                                         

      The two men walk away and get into Mouss' van. John lies
      doubled up on the ground and eventually tries to stand.

108 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM -- NIGHT 108 
      John cleans the cuts on his face with peroxide, adds a Band-
      Aid. He stares at his face, letting defeat wash over him.

109 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 109 
      John deducts $2,000 from the MONEY column.

110 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 110 
      His face purple with bruises, John pulls himself out of bed
      in response to the RINGING DOORBELL.

111 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER -- CONTINUOUS 111 
      John limps to the front door and opens it to see Eugenie,
      his realtor, standing with a nice couple. They see his face,
      try and hide their reactions.

 EUGENIE                    You did remember I was showing the
                   house?

 JOHN                    Give me two minutes.

112 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 112 
      John tacks two large dark blue sheets up over the wall,
      covering his plan.

113 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 113 
      Eugenie reassures her skittish clients.

 EUGENIE                    It really is a great neighborhood.

114 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 114 
      Grace, John's mother, opens the door and sees John's face.


 (CONTINUED) 41. 
114 CONTINUED: 114 
 GRACE                    Oh, my lord!     What happened?

115 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- DAY 115 
      John sits as Grace approaches with iodine and cotton balls.
      Through the window he sees Luke playing with the dog.

 JOHN                    It was stupid, I fell off the bike.

 GRACE                    The bike that's been in our garage
                   for two years? Put your head back.

 JOHN                    Some guy made a crack about Lara.

 GRACE                    So, that's what you do now: punch
                   everyone who thinks she's guilty?

 JOHN                    What's that supposed to mean?

 GRACE                    It means it's important what YOU
                   believe, not --

 JOHN                    Really?   So, what do you believe,
                   Mom?

      John stands and opens the back door.

 GRACE                    Why are you trying to start a fight?

 JOHN                        (calling out back door)
                   Come on, buddy!
                       (to his mother)
                   Where is his bag?

 GRACE                    Why are you doing this?!

      Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears.

 JOHN                    No reason. I just stupidly thought
                   people who loved her would actually
                   believe she's innocent. My mistake.

 (CONTINUED) 42. 
115 CONTINUED: 115 
 GRACE                    Stop this!

      John turns and sees GEORGE standing in the open doorway. He
      has heard everything. He gives his son a dismissive look
      and walks off towards his bedroom. John feels like a heel.

 JOHN                        (to Luke)
                   Give Grandma a kiss.

      Luke does, and the two of them leave with his bag.

116 EXT. GRACE & GEORGE'S - INSIDE THE PRIUS -- DAY 116 
      John gets in and checks his mirror.   Luke is staring at him.           

 LUKE                    Does your face hurt?

 JOHN                    A little.

 LUKE                    Did you hit him back?

 JOHN                    No.

 LUKE                    That's okay.

      John pulls away.                                                        

117 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 117 
      John drives, looking for someone selling fake papers. He
      sees Mouss' parked car and slows; Mouss stares at him. John             
      flashes his middle finger and drives on. Mouss considers                
      doing something but just flips him off.

118 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - ANOTHER INTERSECTION -- NIGHT 118 
      John asks a couple of guys on the corner about papers and is
      turned away. As he returns to his car, he doesn't notice
      MIKE, the long-haired guy from Drake's Bar, watching from
      astride his motorcycle. A SECOND RIDER pulls up beside Mike.
      John pulls out and the motorcycles follow at a distance.

119 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 119 
      John watches Jenna leave; closes the door, climbs the stairs.
 43. 


120 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 120 
      John sees Luke sleeping, surrounded by his animals.       The
      doorbell rings.

121 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 121 
      John peers out surreptitiously, sees MIKE standing there.                    
      He rings the bell again.                                                     

      John runs and snatches a kitchen knife, returns to the door,
      secures the chain lock and opens the door a crack.

 JOHN                  What?

      Mike speaks in a loud, atonal and unnerving voice.

 MIKE                  I was at the bar.    I know what you
                 are looking for.

      Caught off guard by the voice, John just stares at him.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                  I'm deaf, you idiot. I read lips.

      John stares at him, unsure what to do.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                  You really want to talk out here?

      John puts the knife in his back pocket and steps out onto...

122 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 122 
      John tries to look tough.     Mike smiles at John's bravado.

 MIKE                  What do you need?

      John indicates Mike should lower his voice.

 JOHN                  Three passports, a driver's license
                 and social security number that can
                 take a credit check.

 MIKE                  Thirty seven hundred.

 JOHN                  That's too much.

 (CONTINUED) 44. 
122 CONTINUED: 122 
 MIKE                    It is if you never get them. I need
                   photos and a thousand in advance.

      John stares at the man, trying to read him.       He turns.

123 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 123 
      John pulls cash and an envelope from his jacket pocket.

124 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER -- NIGHT 124 
      Mike counts the money and shoves it in his breast pocket.

 MIKE                    I'll bring them Wednesday.

 JOHN                    Not here.   Don't come here again.

      Mike stares at him.      John stares back.

 MIKE                    Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
                   Under the bridge; two o'clock. If
                   I'm not there on time, leave.

      John closes the door behind him and watches Mike walk off
      toward his motorcycle.

125 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 125 
      He drops the carving knife back in the drawer. As he looks
      up, he sees THE SECOND RIDER staring in the window, his helmet
      still on. John's heart almost stops. The rider DRIVES OFF.

126 EXT. STREET - UNDER A BRIDGE -- DAY 126 
      A beat-up old van sits parked on the crumbling sidewalk.                   
      John hands seven hundred dollars to a sketchy-looking guy                  
      inside. The guy hands John a 9MM handgun wrapped in a                      
      oilcloth. John unwraps it and hands it back.                               

 JOHN                    Show me how to load it.

127 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- EVENING 127 
      John and Luke enter the back door. Luke automatically heads
      for the living room. John calls after him:

 JOHN                    No video game.

 (CONTINUED) 45. 
127 CONTINUED: 127 
 LUKE (O.S.)                    Dad!

      John moves to check the answering machine.

 JOHN                    I'll play checkers with you after
                   dinner.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    You'll just lose again.

 EUGENIE (V.O.)                        (on voicemail:)
                   John? It's Eugenie. You're not
                   going to believe it; the people I
                   brought over? They made an offer!
                   I'll bring it in the morning.

 BEEP. 
 JOHN                        (buoyed/to Luke)
                   Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly                            
                   destroy you.                                               

128 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 128 
      John watches a video on YouTube: "How to unlock any door."
      The person on screen demonstrates how to make a "bump key."

 KID ON SCREEN                    -- a bump key. First, find any key                         
                   that fits into the same make of lock.                      

129 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 129 
      John files down a key, held in the jaws of a vice.                      

130 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT 130 
      John inserts the bump key into the door lock, bumps it with
      the butt of a screwdriver. The key won't turn.

131 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 131 
      He files down the key some more.

132 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK PORCH -- NIGHT 132 
      He inserts the key, bumps it, turns.     The lock opens.

133 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - ELEVATOR -- DAY 133 
      John gets in, heading up to his classroom. People avoid
      looking at his face. One woman can't help noticing. John
      nods and smiles. He pushes the elevator button and notices
      the name: OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY.

134 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 134 
      John scans the room as he waits. Two children play in the
      set that is used to teach them how to speak to a prisoner
      behind glass using a phone. A moment later, a woman enters
      with a large shoulder bag. She is a NOTARY.

 NOTARY                  Mr. Brennan?

135 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- MORNING 135 
      No other visitors today.     A NOTARY sits with Lara and John.

 NOTARY                  And just put your thumb there.

      And Lara puts her thumb print on the book.

 NOTARY (CONT'D)                  Thanks, that's all I need.

      The notary heads for the door.     John turns to the female
      guard who is waiting.

 JOHN                  I'll just be a moment.

      He turns back to his wife.

 LARA                      (touching him, melting)
                 Your poor face. How could you do
                 that to yourself?

 JOHN                  I am useless without you.    I can't
                 even ride a bike.

 LARA                  I think it's very sexy.

 JOHN                  I'm sorry we had to do this.

135 CONTINUED: 135 
 LARA                    You have nothing to apologize for.
                   But you should have told me before
                   this.

 JOHN                    I know.

 LARA                    I don't want you not telling me
                   things.

 JOHN                    From now on I will.

 LARA                        (beat)
                   I won't know where to picture you.
                       (off his look)
                   I close my eyes and I see Luke in

                   Window. I won't know where to picture
                   you anymore.

136 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY 136 
      John stares at his laptop as the class does a test. Knowing
      he isn't paying attention, a STUDENT angles his multiple
      choice test so that his friend behind can see the answers.

137 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CORRIDOR -- DAY 137 
      John waits for the janitor to leave his tiny office and grabs
      the door before it closes. He slips inside and finds a rack
      with keys. He takes one from the hook marked ELEVATORS.

138 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 138 
      John files down the elevator key as he did the house key.

139 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- DAY 139 
      John moves aside a box on the shelf and removes the handgun,
      wrapped in an old chamois.

 PAULA (O.S.)                    John?

      He turns to see Paula standing in the open garage door.

 JOHN                    Hi.


 (CONTINUED) 48. 
139 CONTINUED: 139 
      John tries to look casual as he stands with the thinly
      disguised gun in his hand.

 PAULA                    I was wondering if I could ask you
                   to water my plants next week; I'm
                   going in for an operation.

 JOHN                    I hope it's nothing serious.

 PAULA                    My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me.
                   He's blaming the lab; the lab's
                   blaming him. But I'll be fine.
                   Thanks.

      And she walks off.    John gets in the car and slips the gun
      between the seats.

140 INT. PRIUS -- DAY 140 
      John pulls into the empty parking lot beside Don's and waits.
      Checks his watch: 1:49 PM. A car pulls in. The guy sits
      there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant.

141 INT. PRIUS -- DAY 141 
      John checks his watch. 2:14. He looks around, knowing he
      is supposed to leave. He makes a call.

 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)                    English Department, this is Catherine.

 JOHN                    Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling
                   well, I'm going to take him home. I
                   need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.

 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)                    I will let him know.

142 INT. PRIUS - DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON 142 
      John checks his watch: 2:27. His cell phone rings, displays
      the name MICK; John presses IGNORE. He feels for the gun                    
      between the seats.

143 EXT. DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON 143 
      The guy comes out of the restaurant. John watches him walk
      to his car. The man sees him and stares back. John checks
      his watch. 2:45. The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty.

 (CONTINUED) 49. 
143 CONTINUED: 143 
      John presses the VOICEMAIL button on his phone.

 MICK (V.O.)                    Are you ever going to answer your
                   goddamn phone?

      Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John
      realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand
      goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the
      SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window.

 MIKE                    You were supposed to leave.

 JOHN                    I need them.

 MIKE                    You notice that guy was a cop?

 JOHN                    Which guy?

 MIKE                    The one with the red light in his
                   back window.

      John feels ridiculous.       Mike hands him the documents.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                    Just give me the money.

      John hands him the envelope of money.       Mike checks it.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                    You want this too much. You're going
                   to fuck it up.

      Mike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and
      follows. John looks over the passports with their new names.

144 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- AFTERNOON 144 
      Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging
      his lunch pale. John watches him go, then reaches down beside
      his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth. He hides
      it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing.

145 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 145 
      John moves through the line toward the metal detector. He
      takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the
      separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and

 (CONTINUED) 50. 
145 CONTINUED: 145 
      places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal
      detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can
      get to it. He hands the dish to the guard.

 JOHN                    How are you doing today?

 GUARD                    Don't touch that.

 JOHN                    Sorry.

      John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone --
      John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the
      counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors.

      JOHN pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail.

146 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 146 
      John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors.
      He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard
      ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to
      open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator.

      He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing
      and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump
      key. It fits.

      The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting
      room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps
      the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again.
      Visitors keep moving past him.

      He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is
      preoccupied at the door.

      He turns it harder. Nothing.     He tries to pull it out.
      It's stuck. John panics.

      The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd.

      John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and
      snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors
      sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.

      John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the
      slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into
      the crowd and moves on.

      Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to
      the visiting room.

 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 51. 
146 CONTINUED: 146 
      He throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to
      insert his key in the elevator.

      John rounds the corner into the visiting room. The camera
      stays on his face until we finally hear A DEAFENING ALARM.

147 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR -- DAY 147 
      John waits in a line against the wall, beside a door to a
      small office. Through the glass he watches the MAJOR
      interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing.
      She nods and leaves, passing him with a look. The Major
      holds the door open for him.

148 INT. MAJOR'S OFFICE -- A SHORT TIME LATER 148 
      The MAJOR plays John the CCTV video from the corridor. He
      flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall.
      The crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms
      obscures the view of the elevator.

 MAJOR                    So, you are where in here?

 JOHN                    ...In the middle there.

 MAJOR                    In the middle. Can you point to
                   yourself?

 JOHN                        (looks)
                   It's hard to tell.   I think that's
                   me there. Why?

      He freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the
      background.

 MAJOR                    So that's not you there.   By the
                   elevator?

 JOHN                        (looks)
                   ....No.
                       (points to another person)
                   I was over here. You want to tell
                   me what's going on?

 MAJOR                    You want me to tell you?


 (CONTINUED) 52. 
148 CONTINUED: 148 
 JOHN                    Yes.

      The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock.

 MAJOR                    You know what a bump key is?

 JOHN                    Sorry.

      Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John.    Finally:

 MAJOR                    If this was you, you might want to
                   think about what's going to happen
                   to your kids if both of their parents
                   are in prison.

      The major stares right through him.

149 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 149 
      John heads toward the exit, accompanied by a guard. As he
      nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step
      ladder, holding a new CCTV camera.

150 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 150 
      Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge
      to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero
      steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past,
      noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn
      turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby
      and vomits.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    -- The worst date you've ever been
                   on? This was worse. And this guy?                           
                   He really thinks he is doing great.                         
                   Then he's driving me home and I know                        
                   he's going to try and kiss me, so I
                   pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm
                   actually snoring, right in his car.                         
                   Does that stop him?                                         

      John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him.
      They lock eyes. Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying
      attention and wonders what he's looking at.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)                    ...What?


 (CONTINUED) 53. 
150 CONTINUED: 150 
      John turns and walks away.     Quinn keeps watching.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    Did I tell you not to date cops?

      Collero's eyes find John as well.      He disappears around the
      corner.

151 INT. T-TRAIN -- DAY 151 
      John rides home, devastated that his plan has failed, and
      wondering what he will do. He checks over his shoulder to
      make sure he isn't being followed.

152 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- DAY 152 
      John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His
      head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door.
      He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun;
      dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.

 MICK (O.S.)                    Let me in, asshole!!

153 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 153 
      Mick bangs again.                                                          

 MICK (O.S.)                    Open up!
                       (more banging)
                   Your car is in the garage, I know
                   you're in there!

154 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 154 
      John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living
      room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of
      furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows
      he can't let his brother see this.

      The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door
      and looks out and scowls.

 MALE NEIGHBOR                    What's your problem? He's not home!

 MICK                    Not home?   So you're saying I'm blind?

 MALE NEIGHBOR                    No, I'm saying you're an idiot.

      Mick pounds on the door aggressively.      Then just gives up.                

 MICK                    You know what? You're right.    I am
                   an idiot.

      And he walks off to his car.

155 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 155 
      John leans back against the wall, in the middle of the bare
      room, and listens to his brother's car start and drive away.

158 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING 158 
      John stands, staring at his wall, now a vast collage, layer
      upon layer of photographs and notes. And no answers.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    ...Dad?

159 EXT. PARK -- DAY 159 
      John sits on a bench, frustrated and lost.      Luke trots up.

 LUKE                    Can I have my cookies?

 JOHN                    You hungry?    You want your sandwich?

 LUKE                    No.

      John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands
      them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting
      a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention.

 NICOLE                    Carrie!
                       (to John)
                   I'm sorry. She just already has it
                   all figured out.
                       (John nods awkwardly)
                   Nicole.

 JOHN                    I remember.

 JOHN                        (smiles and admits)
                   I remember your daughter.

 NICOLE                    She's hard to forget.
                       (digs in her bag)
                   Oh, this is for you. Luke was
                   supposed to bring it home.

      Hands him an envelope. He opens it and sees a birthday
      invitation with jungle animals on the cover.

 JOHN                    He has his father's memory.

 NICOLE                    It's for Carrie's birthday party.                              
                   Please come; I'd love to meet your                             
                   wife.

 JOHN                    I'm afraid she can't be there.
                   ...It's complicated.

 NICOLE                    I understand. With me, too. Carrie,
                   come on, time for lunch.
                       (to John)
                   We're going to the cafe on the corner,
                   would you like to join us?

 JOHN                    Oh, we're pretty...you know....

 NICOLE                    Busy?

      John smiles, busted.

 NICOLE (CONT'D)                    Come on, we owe you for the cookies.

 JOHN                    That's true.     And I made those
                   cookies.

 NICOLE                    And learned how to pre-package them.

      They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind.
      Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment.

 NICOLE                    Do you trade off time with Luke?

 JOHN                    No. Luke and I are together full
                   time.

 NICOLE                    Wow. I guess that's why I see you
                   so much.

 JOHN                    She'd like nothing better than to be
                   here. With him. Lara. She really
                   misses...all this.

 NICOLE                    I guess it's all about priorities,
                   isn't it?

 JOHN                    No.  She's not like that.   She'd...

 NICOLE                    Oh.

 JOHN                    I don't tell most people.

 NICOLE                    I understand.

 JOHN                    She's innocent. She didn't kill the
                   woman.

 NICOLE                    ...Good.   I mean, I'm sure she didn't.

 NICOLE                    That would be great.

      John heads back and scoops up Luke.       Nicole watches, trying
      not to look dumbfounded.

160 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON 160 
      John and Luke enter, John sorting through the mail.      Nothing            
      from Lara.

161 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 161 
      John finishes writing a letter on lined paper. He opens his
      drawer; it is full of letters in yellow envelopes. He pulls
      one out; it is from Lara, on lined paper. He stuffs his new
      letter in the old yellow envelope.

162 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 162 
      This is the only room that is still furnished. John pokes
      his head in, sees Luke on his bed playing by himself.

 JOHN                    You want to read a letter from Mom?

      Luke shrugs as if he doesn't care, but then scoots over in
      his bed so that his dad can sit beside him. John does. He
      pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As
                   Much As Chocolate...

 LUKE                    She didn't write that.

       Luke and John water Paula's vegetable garden.

 LUKE                   But what's wrong with her?

 JOHN                   She's not feeling well.

 LUKE                   Why didn't she just stay home?

 JOHN                   Because sometimes people get so sick
                  you have to go to the hospital to
                  get fixed.

 LUKE                   How do you know when you're that
                  sick?

 JOHN                   The doctors do tests.

       Something tweaks. John turns and looks back across the alley,
       at his open garage...and remembers their conversation. He
       drops the hose and takes Luke's hand.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Come on.

       They drop the hose in the garden and walk back to the house.

163A INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 163A 
       John flings open the medicine cabinet, finds an old bottle
       of Lara's insulin. He checks the label.                                   

163B INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 163B 
       John hits a key and a medical article appears: LIFE
 THREATENING COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES. 
       ...Severe Hyperkalemia...extremely high levels of potassium
       ...cardiac arrest...particularly dangerous as there are no
       outward symptoms...

164 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - LATER -- NIGHT 164 
       The camera swirls as John searches the wall and photos of
       delivery vans arriving at the jail. Not seeing what he wants,
       he charges the desk & rifles through more photos.

 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 59. 
164 CONTINUED: 164 
      He finally snatches the photo he's looking for. He turns it
      over -- on it is written TUESDAY 9:30 AM. And right over
      the phrase FIND THE KEY he pins the photo of a delivery van
      from a medical laboratory.

165 EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- MORNING 165 
      Parked at a distance, John watches from inside his Prius.
      Finally, a DRIVER steps out of the jail carrying a tray of
      test results. He opens the back door of the van.

166 EXT. STREETS -- DAY 166 
      John follows the van.

167 EXT. NURSING HOME -- DAY 167 
      John watches as the driver steps out with a tray, point and
      push his key fob, lock the doors and enter the nursing home.              

      IN THE PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER - John watches his stopwatch.
      The driver returns with a tray. John hits the stop button.
 1 MINUTE 48 SECONDS. 
168 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 168 
      John Googles: "How to break into a car."

169 INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT 169 
      John heats a screwdriver on the open flame of the gas fire,
      then places the red hot tip of it on an old tennis ball.

170 EXT. P.M.H. LAB -- MORNING 170 
      John waits, eating a donut. He sees the driver step out of                
      Pittsburgh Med Health Lab and walk to his panel van.                      

171 EXT. STREETS -- DAY 171 
      John follows the van again.

172 EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY 172 
      Wearing his iPod, the driver steps out with a tray and presses
      his key fob; the van chirps and locks. He enters the building
      as John steps up to the driver's door.

      John checks no one is watching, places the tennis ball over
      the key slot and punches the ball flat. The lock pops open.

173 INT. LABORATORY VAN -- CONTINUOUS 173 
      Shelves line the walls; on them sit plastic trays of envelopes.
      John climbs in and finds the tray from ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL.

174 EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- CONTINUOUS 174 
      The driver comes back out, heading for the van. He pauses
      to flirt with a nurse on her break, but she isn't buying.

175 INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS 175 
      John finds the envelope marked "Lara Brennan." He checks
      his watch, only 44 seconds have lapsed. He slips the card
      out, photographs it with his cell phone and puts it back.

176 EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY 176 
      The driver heads for the van as John opens the back door and
      climbs out. Oblivious to his narrow escape, John closes the
      door and walks away a heartbeat before the driver gets there.

177 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- EVENING 177 
      John checks his son, who sits on the bare living room floor
      playing a video game on the TV, the remaining item.

 JOHN                  You okay?

      Luke nods and shoots somebody.

178 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING 178 
      John brings up Lara's form in Photoshop on his laptop and
      erases the hand-written numbers in the test results boxes.

179 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 179 
      John writes numbers in the blank boxes of the medical form.
      Then he sits back and worries that he's got it right. Calls:

 JOHN                  Luke!   Time for bed.

180 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 180 
      John enters the child's bedroom and stops dead.

      The wall over Luke's bed is covered with crayon scribbles,
      imitating the chart on his father's bedroom walls.



 (CONTINUED) 61. 
180 CONTINUED: 180 
      Luke walks into the room, and steps up beside his father,
      staring at the wall. He takes his father's hand, and the
      two just stand there in silence.

181 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 181 
      John waits as the other prisoners enter. Lara kisses him;                         
      looks in his eyes. He sees the despair behind the smile.                          

 JOHN                    ...What's wrong?

      She takes a letter from her pocket.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    What is it?

      She hands it to him.       John reads.   His face changes.                        

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    No....NO! They can't move you. Not
                   without notice! Monday isn't notice!                                 

 LARA                    I was only here through the appeal.                                  
                   We knew I'd be moved to a prison.                                    

 JOHN                    Muncy is the other side of the state.                                

      Lara nods. Off John's face, the screen goes BLACK.           Read:                

 THE LAST THREE DAYS 
182 INT. REALTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY 182 
      John stands with Eugenie, the frightened realtor.

 JOHN                    I don't have two weeks!     I need it                                
                   tomorrow!                                                            

 EUGENIE                    The title hasn't been cleared --
                   there is no way that --

 JOHN                    How much can they give me?!

 EUGENIE                    Nothing!

      John turns on his heel and slams out through the door.
 62. 


183 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 183 
      John stares at the wall -- MONEY is down to $1,497.

      He rifles through a drawer, finds a pair of sunglasses.

      He snatches a baseball cap from a top shelf.

      He tosses a bag on the bed, unzips it and pulls out the gun.              

184 EXT. AIRPORT LONG TERM PARKING LOT -- DAY 184 
      John unscrews the license plate from a dusty black Prius.
      He sticks the plate under his jacket, stands and checks over
      his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot.

185 INT. BANK AND MALL PARKING LOT -- DAY 185 
      A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor
      mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the
      stolen license plate.

      Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat
      and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he
      looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens
      the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads
      back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to
      work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do
      this.

      Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs
      up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.

      A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out
      of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and
      scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.

 ELAINE                  What are you doing?!   You almost
                 killed us!

 JOHN                  Are you --?

 ELAINE                  Are you out of your mind?!   You don't
                 look?!

      She stoops to grab the few items that fell.    He tries to
      help.

 JOHN                  I am so sorry --

 (CONTINUED) 63. 
185 CONTINUED: 185 
 ELAINE                    Get away!     Get away from us!

      She stands and runs for her car. John returns to the car
      and sits, leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming.
      He sits there, letting the failure and his disgust for his
      weakness wash over him.

186 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- AFTERNOON 186 
      John sits in the children's area, waiting for the line of
      visitors to get shorter. One look at his face and we can
      see how tortured he is. He has his cell phone to his ear:

 MEYER (O.S.)                    I'm sorry.

 JOHN                    No, it was a long shot.       Thanks.

187 INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 187 
 MEYER                        (into phone)
                   How's Lara?

188 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- CONTINUOUS 188 
 JOHN                    She's okay.     Thanks, Meyer.

      John hangs up and stands.

189 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- AFTERNOON 189 
      John stands in the corner, staring out through the high,
      thick windows. He turns as he hears Lara and other prisoners
      coming. He tries to smile, but she knows something is wrong.

 LARA                    What's wrong?

 JOHN                    Nothing.

 LARA                    Is it Luke?

 JOHN                    No. He's fine. I had Meyer see
                   what he could do about not getting
                   you moved.

 (CONTINUED) 64. 
189 CONTINUED: 189 
 JOHN (CONT'D)                    I told him traveling that distance
                   would be a hardship on us, that Luke
                   was already having trouble at school.
                   Which is true. I haven't been
                   spending enough time with him.

 LARA                    You haven't? YOU haven't? God,
                   John, you are too much. Luke is
                   having a 'hard time' because mommy
                   is in jail for murder, not because
                   daddy doesn't spend enough time with
                   him! Your father was right, you
                   don't live in the same world we do.

 JOHN                        (stung)
                   That's nice, that the two of you
                   talk. What world do I live in, Lara?

 LARA                    I don't know, but it's not the real
                   one. I am in here for the rest of
                   my life! And you want me to believe
                   in some fantasy that -- !

      A guard steps up and raps her knuckles on the table to get
      their attention. Only John looks up.

 FEMALE GUARD                    We good here?

 JOHN                    Yes.   Sorry.

      Lara lowers her voice a little, but not her intensity.    The
      guard walks away under:

 LARA                    Now you come here all long-faced,
                   like you've let me down. What do
                   you want me to do, make you feel
                   better?

 JOHN                    Got it.   I'm sorry.

 LARA                    And now you're apologizing.   You
                   really are a gem.



 (CONTINUED) 65. 
189 CONTINUED: (2) 189 
 JOHN                    What do you want from me?

 LARA                    Nothing. You're too perfect already.
                   You know you never even asked me if
                   I did it. If I killed her.

 JOHN                        (stopped dead)
                   Because I knew you didn't.

 LARA                    Then you'd be wrong.

      She leans forward and whispers in his ear.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I
                   hit her in the face. I heard her
                   neck snap. You know why I did it?
                   Because she pissed me off. I threw
                   her purse in the river. We paid for
                   dinner with the cash from her wallet.

      She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking
      in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I'm sorry.   I'm actually very sorry.

      She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the
      changing room. John watches, unable to breathe.

190 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 190 
      Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then
      disappears behind the partition. She sits on the bench,
      leans her head between her knees, and breaks into shards.

191 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS 191 
      John exits along with all the other visitors, destroyed by
      what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head.
      Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving
      him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing
      there. Commands him:

 GUARD #2                    Sir, you cannot stand there.
                        (beat)
                   SIR, you need to exit the building
 NOW. 66. 


192 INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- MOMENTS LATER 192 
      Lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition.    She
      picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak.

 JOHN                  Shut up. I don't care what you say
                 or how you say it. I don't believe
                 you did it and I never will. I know
                 who you are.

      She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into
      the cradle. She pounds on the window. He just stares at
      her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears.

193 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER 193 
      John steps out and sees the MAJOR waiting with his keys.
      They exchange a look.

 JOHN                  Thank you.

      The Major nods and locks the door.    John heads out.

194 INT. TOY SHOP -- DAY 194 
      Luke in his arms, John takes a My Little Pony off the shelf.                

 JOHN                  You think?

 LUKE                      (already an expert)
                 Girls love them.

195 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 195 
      Grace opens the door. George stands a few steps behind her,
      quiet. Grace sees John and is immediately concerned.

 JOHN                  Hi Mom.

 GRACE                  What are you doing here?

 JOHN                  I've got class.

 GRACE                  Five o'clock at night?


 (CONTINUED) 67. 
195 CONTINUED: 195 
 JOHN                    Yes.
                          (kisses Luke)
                   Bye.

      Luke runs in as John walks off.

196 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 196 
      John's father watches through the window as his son leaves.
      In his gut, George knows something is wrong.

197 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 197 
      John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner
      where he noticed kids selling drugs.

      A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The
      street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an
      exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks
      his watch and settles in to wait.

198 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 198 
      John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And
      then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks
      his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer
      runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the
      driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to
      call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.

199 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 199 
      John follows the flashy car at a distance.    It stops at
      another corner and something is exchanged.    It drives on;
      John follows.

200 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT 200 
      Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill.
      The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.

      Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then
      makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many
      houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks
      over the fences.

      He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a
      house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.
      He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and
      the light goes out again.



 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 68. 
200 CONTINUED: 200 
      John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges
      a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
      exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
      came.

      John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
      fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
      yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait
      between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.

      Fade to BLACK.      Beat, then:   BANG!   BANG!    BANG!

201 EXT. DRUG DEALER'S BACK YARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT 201 
      John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks
      on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
      he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
      holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
      no way he wouldn't see him.

      John holds his     breath and waits. The porch light flicks
      off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
      As before, the     two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
      John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else.

      John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
      over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!

      He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
      him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --
      ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.

202 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 202 
      Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately
      attacks David, biting his leg. David screams in agony.

 JOHN                        (to Alex)
                   Back up! Get back!

      Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims
      a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind
      David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely
      by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.

 ALEX                    -- Shoot them both!

 JOHN                    -- I'll shoot the dog!


 (CONTINUED) 69.

 ALEX                    -- Shoot the dog!

 THUG                    -- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!

      John fires into the floor beside the dog.

 ALEX                    -- You want the police here, asshole?!

 JOHN                    -- Good idea!

      John fires two more shots into the floor.

 ALEX                        (to thug)
                   -- Put the gun down!

      The thug obeys, rests it against the wall.

 JOHN                    -- Call the dog off!!   Put it away!

 ALEX                    -- Release!

      The dog stops its attack but goes back to barking.

 JOHN                    -- Put it away!!
                       (aims gun at it)
 PUT IT AWAY!! 
      Alex reluctantly opens a closet door.

 ALEX                    In!   Get in!

      He has to shove the barking dog into the closet.

 JOHN                        (to thug)
                   You, too!

 THUG                    I'm not getting in there!

      John fires into the wall!

 ALEX                    Get in!

 (CONTINUED) 70. 
202 CONTINUED: (2) 202 
      And the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog.            John
      sees the bolt and drives it home, locking the door.

 JOHN                    -- Give me that chair!

      Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him.
      John props it under the handle of the closet door.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Move!

      He shoves David forward, closer to Alex.

 ALEX                    You're dead.

 DAVID                    I didn't do anything!!

 ALEX                    You brought him!

 DAVID                    I didn't bring him!

 JOHN                    Shut up!

      He pushes them both back into the next room; the dog in the
      closet never stops barking.

203 INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT 203 
      John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between
      them.

 JOHN                    On your knees! Hands behind your
                   head!

      John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following
      his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs
      it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.

 DAVID                    I can't kneel!

 JOHN                    On the floor!

      David kneels with great difficulty.         Alex calmly does as
      he's told, his eyes on John.

 (CONTINUED) 71. 
203 CONTINUED: 203 
      John grabs the paper bag out of Alex's hand and opens it,
      finds a couple thousand in cash.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Where's the rest?

 DAVID                    That's twelve hundred dollars!
                       (emptying his pockets)
                   Here, take it.

      A couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor.

 JOHN                        (gun on Alex)
                   Where do you keep your money?!

      Alex scoffs, seeing weakness in John.

 ALEX                    Yeah, I'm going to give you my money.

 JOHN                    I'll shoot you!

 ALEX                    You won't even shoot a dog.

 JOHN                    Tell me!

 ALEX                    Shoot the floor again, impress me.

      John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his
      gun to his head while he is on the ground bleeding.

 JOHN                    I'm going to kill you both.

 ALEX                    No, I'm going to kill you both.

 DAVID                    Give him your money!

 ALEX                        (to David)
                   Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.

      Enraged, John fires a round into Alex's leg.      Alex screams.



 (CONTINUED) 72. 
203 CONTINUED: (2) 203 
 DAVID                    Stop it!!

 ALEX                        (smiles thru pain)
                   See? You aren't going to kill me.
                   That was the worst you can do. So,
                   now you've done it. Go home. I'll
                   come find you and kill you.

      John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of
      tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours
      it on the floor.

 ALEX (CONT'D)                    You're wasting some good shit.

      Now he pours it on Alex.

 JOHN                    Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.

      John smashes the bottle on the floor; tequila goes everywhere.

 THUG (O.S.)                    What's going on?! Let me out!

 ALEX                    You going to burn me out?

      John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to
      yell and pound. Now calmly:

 JOHN                    Yeah.    That's what I'm going to do.

 DAVID                    Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.

 JOHN                    Your money.

 ALEX                        (no longer smiling)
                   This is a meth lab, you idiot!

 JOHN                    No.    It was.

      And he tosses the burning rag at the smashed bottle.        David
      screams as the room explodes in flames.



 (CONTINUED) 73. 
203 CONTINUED: (3) 203 
 ALEX                        (suddenly desperate)
                   My kid is upstairs!!

 JOHN                    -- What??

 ALEX MY KID!! 
      Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned,
      John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the
      gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.

 DAVID                    Let me go!!

 JOHN                    Get up there!!

      John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the
      trail of blood.

 DAVID                    The house is going to explode!

 ANGLE ON BACK DOOR 
      Fire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun
      leans against the wall where the thug left it. The closet
      door rocks as the thug kicks. The chair won't give way.

204 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT 204 
      John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and
      down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the
      next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.

      Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
      the small bed, his back to us.

      Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.

      A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
      side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
      floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...

      Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward.
      David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over
      him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....

      John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.


 (CONTINUED) 74. 
204 CONTINUED: 204 
      John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David.   David
      looks around through the roiling smoke:

 JOHN                    Is anyone up here?!

      He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet --
      empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns
      to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
      safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag
      on the floor half-filled with cash.

      John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into
      the trash bag.

205 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- CONTINUOUS 205 
      The dog barks; the door SPLINTERS.

206 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 206 
      John steps over the bodies; sees David looking up at him.

 DAVID                    Don't leave me. I don't want to
                   burn. Don't let me burn.

      The hall is now thick with smoke. John stares terrified at
      the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he
      knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.

207 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 207 
      John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot
      kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.

208 EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 208 
      John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into
      the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger
      seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a
      heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at
      the partially open window. John struggles to get the car
      turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his
      way into the car.

      Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the
      back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.

      John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in
      the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the
      car, the thug getting off a shot.
 75. 


209 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS 209 
      John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant
      and shattering a taillight.

210 INT. PRIUS - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS 210 
      John slams the transmission into Drive and speeds off down
      the street.

      The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds
      of the dying man. John keeps throwing looks over his
      shoulder.

 DAVID                  I don't want to die.   I don't want
                 to die.

      Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the
      back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.

      John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
      approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself
      in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.                  

211 EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT 211 
      John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He
      steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes
      the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body
      lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered.

212 INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - TOILET -- NIGHT 212 
      Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the
      wound in his side.

      He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies
      a bandage, fresh from the box. He pulls a new shirt and
      jacket from a Target bag.

      A moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full
      of cash into his backpack.

213 INT. FAST FOOD JOINT -- NIGHT 213 
      John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket. He
      barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out
      of the restaurant. Cut to BLACK.
 76. 


214 EXT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 214 
      Water streams from the house, the front door and windows
      broken by firemen who now pack up their gear to leave.
      LIEUTENANT NABULSI strides into shot, drinking a Red Bull,
      which he crushes and discards on the porch.

215 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 215 
      Nabulsi climbs the stairs to find SGT. HARRIS watching the
      CSI team work. Nabulsi steps up behind the CSI worker.                    

 LT. NABULSI                      (almost a whisper)
                 Get out of my way.

      The man flees like he just saw the prince of darkness.
      Nabulsi cocks his head and looks down at the dead man.

 LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)                  What do we have?

 SGT. HARRIS                  A miracle. Meth lab in the basement,
                 the house still standing. Should be
                 just a crater.

 LT. NABULSI                      (straddles Alex)
                 Do we know him?

 SGT. HARRIS                  Alex Gaidar, history of violence and
                 drug trafficking.

      Nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room.

 LT. NABULSI                  He have a kid?

 SGT. HARRIS                  Neighbor said wife left with him
                 last year. Big surprise there.

 LT. NABULSI                  They type all this blood yet?

 SGT. HARRIS                  No, but someone left through the back
                 door bleeding. Zone Three found a
                 gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.

      Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs.
 77. 


216 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- NIGHT 216 
      John snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns
      and walks back to the Prius.

217 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 217 
      John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key
      from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is
      surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters,
      carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair.
      When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas,
      reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.

 JOHN                  Hi.    What are you doing up?

      George shrugs.     An uncomfortable silence.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                  I've come to get Luke.

      George nods. After another silence, John starts down the
      hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him.

 GEORGE                  John?    Are you alright?

      John turns around, surprised.

 JOHN                  I'm fine.

      The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the
      room.

      His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket
      falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and
      sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane
      tickets and passports.

218 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 218 
      John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke
      sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his
      face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here,
      and is overwhelmed.

219 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 219 
      George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket.
      We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the
      passport and reads each of the false names.
 78. 


220 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 220 
      John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like
      this. He tries to wake Luke.

 JOHN                  Hey.   Hey, buddy.

      Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just
      after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment.

221 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT 221 
      John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock.
      It's almost five. How could that have happened?

222 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT 222 
      John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in
      his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food.

 JOHN                  What do you say?

 LUKE                  Thank you.

 JOHN                  Give Grandma a big kiss.

 LUKE                  I'm too tired to kiss.

 JOHN                  Luke...

 GRACE                  I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.
                     (to John)
                 We want to take him to the Harvest
                 Festival in Kutztown, where they
                 have the Clydesdales.

      John thinks about saying something, can't.   He watches Luke
      give Grace a kiss.

 LUKE                  Thank you, Grandma.

      John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway.

      His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it.
      The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket.

 (CONTINUED) 79. 
222 CONTINUED: 222 
      John realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He
      looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John
      can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows.

 JOHN                    Bye Mom.

      They kiss.    John's father stands behind him.

 GEORGE                    Goodbye.

      George grabs his son in an awkward hug.      John is shocked.
      He pats his father's back. They break.

 JOHN                        (to Luke)
                   Let's go.

      John leaves.      The front door closes.   Grace walks away.

223 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- PRE-DAWN 223 
      John stands in the brightly lit, glass-walled kiosk of a
      rental car company, the Prius parked at the curb, as the sun
      threatens to break over the horizon.

224 EXT. STREET NEAR ALEX'S HOUSE -- PRE-DAWN 224 
      Nabulsi kneels beside a fire hydrant, using a shard from a
      taillight to scrape at a smudge of flaking black paint.
      Harris comes running up, out of breath, from the alley.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase
                   a black car down the alley, so that's
                   probably his. We'll have the
                   taillight debris at the lab by the
                   time it opens.

 LT. NABULSI                    Before.                                                         

      Nabulsi stands and hands him the large shard of glass.                       

225 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 225 
      John packs a backpack -- two white lab coats, wire cutters,
      a large screwdriver, two rolls of duct tape, the handgun,
      insulin vials, etc.

226 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING 226 
      Luke sits on his bedroom floor, trying to cram a firetruck                
      into his already full rollerboard.                                        

 LUKE                      (calls)
                 Can I carry it?

      John appears with a box of trash bags.

 JOHN                  No.    Just what fits in your bag.                             

      John hurries off.

 LUKE                  ....What about my pockets?

 JOHN (O.S.)                  Or your pockets.

      Luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table.
      He digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave
      him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket.

      A quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor.

227 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 227 
      John takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his              
      wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35.                      

      He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos,
      sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything. He
      decides it is too late to worry. He loosens an edge of
      wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.

228 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING 228 
      Luke sits in the back seat with their carry-on bags. John
      tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the
      back.

      He picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to
      the alley. He looks around, then stuffs this final bag into
      his neighbor's trash can.

229 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- MORNING 229 
      John tosses the last trash bags over the side of the dumpster

      He checks the clock on the dashboard and drives faster, taking
      a quick glance at his son to see if he is okay back there.

231 EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- MORNING 231 
      John sits in his car in the back alley, watching the parking
      lot. The driver comes out carrying trays of test results
      and puts them in the back of his van. John grabs the large                
      wire cutters and screwdriver from his car and hops out. He                
      takes a few steps to the rear of the one-story building,
      pries open the phone box and snips the phone wires.

232 INT. P.M.H. LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT 232 
      A clerk on the phone is cut off. She jabs the connection
      key, does not get a dial tone -- looks to the lights on the
      other phone lines and sees them go out as...

233 EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT 233 
      John snips the last wire and hops back into the car.     He is
      moving before the van exits the parking lot.

234 EXT. NURSING HOME -- MORNING 234 
      The van driver hops out and heads into the nursing home as
      the Prius pulls into the foreground. John turns to Luke.

 JOHN                  Daddy will just be a minute.

      John grabs his tennis ball.

235 INT. LABORATORY VAN -- MORNING 235 
      John holds his lab results between his teeth as he flips
      through the envelopes. He finally finds Lara's envelope,
      removes her report and replaces it with this one.

236 EXT. NURSING HOME -- MORNING 236 
      We watch through the windshield of the Prius as the lab van
      drives off in the direction of the prison.

      it open, checks the handwritten address.

                   What kind of a criminal drives a
                   Prius?

 SGT. HARRIS                    A socially responsible one?

 LT. NABULSI                    How many registered to felons?

 SGT. HARRIS                    Six in the state. Four of them to
                   embezzlers or white collar criminals,
                   one to a rapist, one to a murderer.

 LT. NABULSI                    Guess we start with the murderer.

 SGT. HARRIS                    She's in prison for life.      The rapist
                   is out.

 LT. NABULSI                    Find him.

      They see Nicole in the side yard, spreading a paper tablecloth.              

 JOHN                    ...Hi.                                                          

      They move to help keep the tablecloth from blowing away.                     

 NICOLE                    Thanks.   Good to see you.

      he sees him.

      He hangs up and turns to see John enter, carrying Luke's                  
      backpack, wearing a white doctor's smock. He raises a gun.                

 JOHN                    Put the phone down.

      Guard #1 obeys.

      Guard #2 reaches for his weapon; John pistol whips him to                      
      the floor. The nurse cups a hand over her mouth to stifle a

 SGT. HARRIS                    She just said --

      A second handgun and holster      slides across the floor to meet              
      the one that already lies by      John's feet. The two guards
      kneel, facing the far wall.       John pulls a roll of duct tape               
      from the backpack and tosses      it to the terrified nurse.                   

 JOHN                    Tape their hands and feet.
                       (when he hesitates)

      The nurse tapes the guards' wrists behind their backs.                         

 LARA                    You have to stop this.

      John yanks her clothing and a white smock out of the bag and
      tosses them to her.

 JOHN                    Put it on.

                    Tell him he is alone now and his
                    mother and father aren't coming back!

       Lara stares at him with hatred, mutters:

 LARA                     You son of a bitch.

       Lara pulls off her prison garb, standing before them naked
       except for her panties. She quite purposely does not turn
       away or cover herself, but lets her eyes burn into him.
       John presses the STOPWATCH button on his watch and the COUNTER
       starts running.

259 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY 259 
       A squad car pulls up outside the hospital's main entrance.
       One officer strides into the Emergency Room while the other
       takes a look around the parking lot.

260 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR HALLWAY 260 
       Lara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to               
       the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice            
       DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The              
       Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to              
       understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall                 
       and stares after them.                                                   

 DR. LIFSON                     What are you doing?                                         

       John yanks Lara's arm and makes a dash for the elevator,                 
       pulling his gun from his pocket.                                         

       The Duty Nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the                 
       hall, throwing open the door to room 7725.                               

260A INT. HOSPITAL - 7TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY 260A 
       The elevator doors are closing as John arrives and jams his              
       arm in between them. The passengers see the weapon.

 JOHN                     Get out!    Get out!

       They scurry out and the doors close. A heartbeat later the               
       next elevator opens and the cop from downstairs steps off.               

261 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- DAY 261 
 LARA                     Where's Luke?! Is he safe?   Where
                    is he?!

 JOHN                     He's safe!

262 EXT. EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY 262 
       The unmarked car brakes hard. Nabulsi and Harris stride out
       and into the ER, flipping their ID into their breast pockets.

263 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- DAY 263 
       Lara and John barely breath.                                             

264 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HANDICAP PARKING AREA -- DAY 264 
       The uniformed officer who stayed outside finds John's black
       Prius with the broken taillight parked in a handicapped spot.
       He lifts his walkie and CALLS IT IN.

265 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN FLOOR -- DAY 265 
       Nabulsi jabs the elevator button. He reacts as a HOSPITAL
       SECURITY GUARD comes running toward him.

 LT. NABULSI                     What's wrong?

       Before he can answer, the elevator doors open and they come
       face to face with John and Lara. John sees their police IDs
       and levels his weapon.

       Around them, patients and employees scream and run away.

 JOHN                     Back away!

 LT. NABULSI                     Don't be stupid. Drop the weapon.                           

 JOHN                     Get back!

 JOHN                        (to Lara)
                   Hit the button.

      Lara stands frozen.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Hit it!

      She presses a button.     The doors start to close.

 LT. NABULSI                    Don't do this.                                               

      Doors closed.     Nabulsi runs and screams:

 LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)                    Where are the stairs?!

      HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2 leads the way. Nabulsi and Harris
      pass him at the door as he yells into his walkie.

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2                    Male and female; white lab coats!
                   Parking levels!

266 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS 266

 JOHN                    It'll be okay.

                   Look at me! Do what I say; it'll be
                   okay; I promise.

      She stares at him, having never seen him like this before.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Lara?

      She nods.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Take the coat off.
 93. 


267 INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL AND P1 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 267 
      Nabulsi, Harris and the guard bound down the stairs into the
      lower elevator lobby. Nabulsi sees the doors aren't opening
      and runs back to the stairs, meeting the cop from upstairs
      on his way down.

 LT. NABULSI                   Stay here!

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2                       (into walkie)
                  Parking garage! Get your asses down
                  here!

      Nabulsi and Harris leave them and thunder down the stairs.

268 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 268 
      The elevator doors open and John tosses the lab coats out
      toward a trash can in the direction of the garage. He pounds
      the elevator button.

269 INT. P2 LEVEL 269 
      Nabulsi and Harris burst onto this floor -- see the elevator
      doors are closed.

 LT. NABULSI                   Watch that door!

      Harris obeys as Nabulsi flings himself down the next flight.

270 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 270 
      The elevator isn't closing. John slams the button repeatedly.
      He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims
      the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing.
      Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi
      gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs
      out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the
      parked cars.

      Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a
      SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi
      realizes they couldn't have escaped this way; he's been had.              

 LT. NABULSI                       (shouts into walkie)
                  Who's in the lobby?!

      But he only gets static.    He charges back toward the stairs.            
 94. 


271 INT. ELEVATOR - LOBBY LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 271 
      The doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his
      weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors
      he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's
      hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner.

      They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing
      another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.

      They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward
      them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when
      Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs
      past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken
      their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and
      turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and
      speaks.

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1                  Main floor, rear corridor.

      John and Lara turn a corner. John spots the SHIPPING OFFICE.             
      They enter and head for the loading bay.

272 INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS 272 
      Nabulsi and Harris break into the lobby, sweating. Officers
      run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene,
      realizes they couldn't have gone out the front. He hears a
      shout:

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)                  Back here!

      They turn and run in the direction of the voice, turning the
      corner and seeing the SECURITY GUARD at the end of the hall,
      who sees them coming turns and runs off after John and Lara.

 LT. NABULSI                      (into radio, on the run)
                 Get units to Grant Street!

273 EXT. HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS 273 
      John punches open the door and they hop down off the dock
      and take off for the street.

274 EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 274 
      John tugs Lara across the street, dodging traffic. He yanks              
      off his jacket and pulls it back on inside-out -- this side              
      is black and gold.                                                       
 95. 


275 EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 275 
       Nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of                  
       Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very                     
       few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a                    
       crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to                 
       a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving                      
       toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team                      
       colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses.                            

276 EXT. NEARBY PEDESTRIAN MALL -- DAY 276 
       Lara and John weave through the fans.                                        

 JOHN                    Put your hair down.                                              

       Lara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then
       opens a door. Leaving the throng of fans, he guides Lara                     
       through and down the stairs into the T-Train Subway Station.

277 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 277 
       Nabulsi runs to the crosswalk as Harris takes the other                      
       direction. The other two officers take the far sidewalks.                    

278 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 278 
       John and Lara quicken their pace.    The camera tilts up and                 
       to the glass ceiling.                                                        

278A EXT. PEDESTRIAN MALL -- CONTINUOUS 278A 
       Nabulsi searches the faces in the mall. He looks down through                
       the station skylight, catches a fleeting glimpse of them. He                 
       runs for the entrance, his walkie flying to his face.                        

 LT. NABULSI                    They're on the platform! Block

279 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 279 
       John sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs.                  
       Almost dragging Lara, John nudges past slower people to make                 
       it onto the train. Then they wait. The doors don't close.                    

280 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS 280 
       Walkie in hand, Harris jumps into their unmarked car and                     
       pulls out. Two SQUAD CARS wail out past him.

282 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 282 
      John spots him coming, slips the long screwdriver from the                
      small backpack he's carrying. Lara sees him tighten his                   
      fingers around the grip. The doors finally close just as:                 

283 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 283 
      Nabulsi bounds down the stairs. The train leaves the station.             
      Nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it.                         

284 EXT. T-TRAIN STATION -- DAY 284 
      This station sits above ground. Three squad cars scream up.
      The officers clamor out of the cars and run for the platform.             

285 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- DAY 285 
      Harris skids the unmarked vehicle around the corner, heading
      parallel to the underground.

286 INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL -- DAY 286 
      Nabulsi runs down the tracks, the car ahead nowhere in sight.

287 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 287 
      The T-Train DRIVER gets an emergency call from the base. He
      looks back into the car as IT RISES UP OUT OF THE UNDERGROUND.

      Daylight floods the car as the train emerges from underground.
      John jams the long screwdriver into the door and PRIES IT
 OPEN. 
288 EXT. T-TRAIN AND TRACKS -- DAY 288 
      The wheels SCREECH and the brakes SEIZE. Passengers topple
      to the floor. John grabs Lara and they leap out onto the
      tracks.

      He finds the slit he cut in the tall fence. They slip out
      through it, onto the street and into the parking lot beyond.

289 INT. HARRIS' UNMARKED CAR -- CONTINUOUS 289 
      Harris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks.
      He locks up his BRAKES as he sees the stalled T-Train.

290 EXT. PARKING LOT - OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS 290 
      John yanks off his jacket as they jump into the rented SUV.                 
      John calms his racing heart, drives away and turns the corner.              

291 EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS 291 
      Harris leaps from his vehicle and runs to the fence on his
      side of the tracks -- it is ten feet tall with razor wire,
      no way over it. He sees:

      Nabulsi charge up out of the tunnel. He jumps into the
      stalled train car, looks around, doesn't see John and Lara.

292 EXT. TUNNEL UNDER RIVER -- MORNING 292 
      The SUV comes up out of the dark and drives away from the
      city center, as a police helicopter swoops overhead, going
      the opposite direction.

293 INT. RENTED SUV -- MORNING 293 
      John checks the counter, still running on his watch. 11:05.
      He wets his thumb and rubs his wrist until the 15 is erased.
      All that remains now is the second number: 35. They merge
      into traffic heading toward the suburbs.

294 EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- MORNING 294 
      Nabulsi pushes through the hole in the wire. Harris runs
      across the tracks with his jacket off, having scaled the
      fence on the far side.

                   had was old. I hope I got it right.

      She opens the glove box, unzips the case, and is touched by                  
      this small gesture.

296 INT. POLICE STATION - HOMICIDE DIVISION -- DAY 296 
      Detective Collero, who we last saw when they arrested Lara,

297 EXT. NICOLE'S HOUSE -- MORNING 297 
      Lara sits in the SUV at the curb. John waits at the door.
      It is opened by BRENDA, Nicole's mother.                                     

 BRENDA                    Hello.

 JOHN                    Hi.   I'm here for my son.

 JOHN                    Back from where?

 BRENDA                    The zoo.

      Finds an invite and hands it to him.       The back clearly says             
      they are going to the zoo.

      John turns and walks back to the SUV.          Brenda watches for a              
      moment, made curious by his behavior.

      He gets into the vehicle.         Lara is in a panic.

 LARA                    What's wrong?

      John punches ZOO into POINTS OF INTEREST on the GPS.                             

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Where's Luke?

 JOHN                    He's at the party.

      He sneaks a look at his stopwatch: 24 MINUTES and counting.

 LARA                    What party?     You said the party was                              
                   here.

 JOHN                    I was wrong.     She took them to the                               
                   zoo.

      The GPS comes up with an address.          John punches a button.

 LARA                           (can't help herself)
                   She?                                                                

 GPS VOICE                    Estimated drive time: seventeen
                   minutes.

 JOHN                    Carrie's mom. Nicole.                                               

      He drops the transmission into gear and speeds off.

298 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING 298 
      A squad car is waiting, another arrives.          Harris pulls up
      and strides toward the house.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Canvas the neighbors. We're looking
                   for the boy and anything they've
                   noticed in the last few days.

299 EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING 299 
      John drives like a man possessed.

300 INT. SUV - DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION -- MORNING 300 
      John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an                    
      intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror,                 
      the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them.

      John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer              
      at 35, praying he's not their target.

      The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the
      four lane street.

      John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch -
      29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS.

 GPS VOICE                    Time to destination: eleven minutes.

      Lara sees him sweat, unaware of the significance of the time.

301 EXT. STREETS -- DAY 301 
      The SUV swerves around a corner, heading into the outskirts
      of town.

302 INT. SUV - FOUR LANE STREET -- DAY 302 
      John's eyes flick to his stopwatch: 32 minutes flicks to 33.

      Signs appear quickly now.    Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next
      Left.

      John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to
      make this choice -- their freedom, or their son.

      Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can
      escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to
      them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his
      grandparents after all.

      Then there it is:

      The sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on
      the right.

 (CONTINUED) 101. 
302 CONTINUED: 302 
      The sign to the Zoo sits behind it, pointing to the next road
      on the left.

 34:02, 34:03, 34:04... 
      John takes the freeway ramp.

303 EXT. INTERSTATE -- CONTINUOUS 303 
      The SUV climbs up the on-ramp, leaving the city behind.                  

304 INT. SUV - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS 304 
 LARA                    You took the wrong turn!    It's back
                   there.

      No response. Lara looks back over her shoulder, wondering                
      if this is some kind of shortcut.                                        

 LARA (CONT'D)                    The zoo is back there. You're going                         
                   the wrong way!

                       (no response)
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!! 
 JOHN                    She'll call my parents.

 LARA                    What??

 JOHN                    They'll take care of him, I will
                   figure out how to get him to us.

 LARA                    Are you out of your mind!

 JOHN                    I tried!! There's no more time!!
                   Any second now there's going to be a
                   roadblock ahead! It might be there
                   now!! If we don't get out now we
                   don't get out!!

      Lara sits back in her seat, stunned and horrified, as John
      continues.




 (CONTINUED) 102. 
304 CONTINUED: 304 
 JOHN (CONT'D)                    I promise. I promise I will find a                           
                   way to get Luke to us. I will find
                   some way.

      Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch.
      John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he
      slams his foot on the brakes!

      The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn.

      Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision.
      John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a
      circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder,
      miraculously facing in the right direction.

      John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt.               
      She opens the door and steps out.                                         

      John closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back
      together. He opens his door and steps out.                                

305 EXT. INTERSTATE HWY - SHOULDER -- DAY 305 
      John sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's              
      pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and                 
      comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel
      shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the
      field beyond. He sits beside her in silence.

      Behind them the cars whip by.    No one even thinks to stop to
      see if they need help.

      Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.

      There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know
      how they got here.

      Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without
      looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger
      with his. He slowly gathers strength from her touch.                      

306 INT. SUV - ON THE SHOULDER -- MOMENTS LATER 306 
      They close the doors, and John starts the engine and they
      drive forward. John takes the first exit.

307 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - ALLEY -- DAY 307 
      A garbage truck is just pulling up as Paula shows Harris and
      an officer her recycling bin. They pull out John's
      overstuffed trash bag.
 103. 


308 EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE -- DAY 308 
      Lara sits in the SUV by herself, watching the entrance.

309 EXT. ZOO -- DAY 309 
      Nicole, surrounded by a dozen six year-olds, passes Luke off
      to John.

 JOHN                  No, it really is fine. I can't thank
                 you enough for taking care of him.

 NICOLE                  It is our pleasure.    Wasn't it,
                 Carrie?

      John and Luke turn and walk toward the exit.

310 EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS 310 
      Lara turns and sees John and Luke walking toward her.

 LARA                  Hi.

 LUKE                  Hi.

 LARA                  Did you have a nice time at the party?

 LUKE                  Yeah.

      Lara walks him to the car, as if this day is no different
      than any other.

 LARA                  What was your favorite thing?

 LUKE                  Ice cream cake.

      She lifts him into his seat and buckles him in.

 LARA                  They had ice cream cake here?

 LUKE                  At Carrie's house.



 (CONTINUED) 104.

 LARA                    Oh.   What flavor?

 LUKE                    Lots of flavors.

 LARA                    My favorite.

      John starts the car.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I'm going to sit back here, okay?

 JOHN                    Sure.

      Luke plays with a toy. Lara closes the door behind her.
      She looks out the window and sees:

      NICOLE standing at the entrance, looking at her.                        

      Not exactly sure why she does it, LARA offers her a grateful
      smile.

      NICOLE watches them pull away, confused about what she should
      do.

311 INT. SUV - ZOO PARKING LOT EXIT -- CONTINUOUS 311 
      John drifts up to the stop sign at the intersection. A sign
      points out the interstate to the left -- and he can see the             
      overpass and freeway entrance; the business district to the             
      right. He checks his watch: 48 minutes. He resets it to                 
      zero. Game over.                                                        

      He switches on the radio and searches for NEWS.

      Luke taps Lara on the shoulder.    She leans down.

 LUKE                    I think we're going to the cottage.

 LARA                    Really?

      He nods knowingly.

 LUKE                    I have money.

      Lara almost loses it; smiles.


 (CONTINUED) 105. 
311 CONTINUED: 311 
 LARA                    Good.   Then I'll stick close to you.

 LUKE                    Okay.

      John finds the news station.

 NEWS RADIO                    -- Traffic down to two lanes at the
                   tollbooths. And downtown is worse.
                   Stay away from the train station if
                   you are trying to get anywhere. Not
                   sure what is happening but a KPGH                             
                   caller says trains aren't moving and
                   commuters are getting irate.
                       (etc.)

 LARA                    John?
                       (no reply)
                   What are we going to do?

 JOHN                        (finally)
                   We're going to the train station.

      John turns right, heading downtown.

312 INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY 312 
      Detective Quinn spots Harris fly in carrying a brimming green
      trash bag. Quinn jumps up and follows him into the SITUATION
      ROOM. COLLERO hurries to catch up.

      Harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she
      enters. Quinn immediately dives into the contents. HARRIS
      and COLLERO share an awkward look.

 SGT. HARRIS                          (smitten)
                   Hi.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                          (casting her eyes down)
                   Hi.

      She and Harris dig into the crumpled papers and photos.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                         (to Collero)
                   You're not going to nod off, are

      Collero gives Quinn a burning look.    Nabulsi enters.

313 EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DAY 313 
      John double-parks and pulls on a ball cap. Traffic is
      snarled, the place is awash with police and squad cars.
      Hundreds of people mill out front.

 JOHN                    Stay in the car.

      John puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle
      of it all. Lara watches, certain he will be spotted and
      arrested.

      John steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors.
      He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on
      to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested.
      He approaches an elderly couple.

314 EXT. INTERSTATE -- DAY 314 
      The SUV heads up the on-ramp.

315 INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY 315 
      Nabulsi is on the phone, catching hell from his Captain, who            
      has had an earful from his counterpart in the State Police.             

 LT. NABULSI                    I understand....I understand. I
                   didn't tell them to stop EVERY
                   vehicle. Just the ones with a couple
                   and a young child.

      He hangs up, takes the quarter from his pocket and spins it
      on his desk.

316 INT./EXT. FREEWAY TOLLBOOTH -- DAY 316 
      John spies the tollbooth ahead, traffic down to two lanes.              
      The ELDERLY MAN beside him has a small bag on his lap.                  

 ELDERLY MAN                    Are you sure twenty dollars is enough?
                   Ticket to Buffalo costs three times
                   that.

      And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat,
      with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll.

      A State Trooper waves them toward the booth.                                

      The trooper ahead checks them out and waves them on.       They             
      are free.

      The same trooper stops the car behind them -- in it, a couple               
      with a child.

317 INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY 317 
 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    Every one in the state.

 LT. NABULSI                    You know what direction they are
                   going, smart ass?

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    Captain, a lot of these places barely
                   have fax machines.

 LT. NABULSI                    Then start dialing.

                   Prioritize. Closest airports first.                            

      Nabulsi spins the quarter again, staring at it as if it will
      give him the answer.

318 EXT. DOWNTOWN BUFFALO -- AFTERNOON 318 
      The Brennans drop off the elderly couple. John waves, drops                 
      his gun in the trash can, gets back in and drives away.                     

319 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 319

      Harris steps out into the HALL, passing an INTERVIEW ROOM.

      Behind the glass he sees QUINN grilling MICK. Harris keeps               
      going into Nabulsi's office. Nabulsi sits, spinning the
      coin, jacket off, shirt untucked.

 SGT. HARRIS                    You want to see it?

 LT. NABULSI                    Only if it will tell me where they
                   are.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Not so lucky.

      Nabulsi flattens the coin. Something makes him stare at his              
      fingers. He moves his hand, revealing a Canadian quarter.                

 LT. NABULSI                    How far is it to the Canadian border?

 SGT. HARRIS                    Four, five hours?

      Nabulsi comes out of his office, passing a waiting ERIT.

 ERIT                    Excuse me?   You call this coffee?

      Nabulsi shakes that off and enters the SITUATION ROOM. Every
      phone at the table is manned, all having the same conversation:

 SGT. HARRIS                    I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Police
                   Department. We have a fugitive
                   warrant for Lara and John Brennan,
                   they are most likely traveling with
                   their six year-old son, and we have
                   reason to believe they might be flying
                   out of your airport.

      Collero hangs up from her call and looks to the next number.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     Should I stop calling and count?

       Nabulsi gives her a look.      Collero dials.

 SGT. HARRIS                     Yes, we are sending you photographs.
                    We would appreciate it if you could
                    disseminate them....How many terminals?

 DETECTIVE QUINN                         (bursts in)
                    I got his parents!

                    Long way to go with just carry-on.

 JOHN                         (smiles)
                    You know how many times you've lost
                    our bags?

 AIR CANADA CLERK                     I hear you.

325 INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 325 
       John and Lara wait for Luke to step through the metal
       detector. The alarm sounds. John and Lara react as the
       security agent takes Luke into the glass isolation booth.

326 INT. POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOMS -- NIGHT 326 
       Collero questions Grace on the other side of the glass.       She

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    So, you just decided to go for a
                   drive, for the entire day?

 GRACE                    George wanted to see the leaves.

      Track to the next room, where Nabulsi questions George.

 LT. NABULSI                    So you have absolutely no idea where
                   they are going?

 GEORGE                    I told you.    We never spoke.

      George stares Nabulsi down.

327 INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 327 
      A female security agent searches Luke, digs a handful of
      Canadian quarters out of his pocket. John's heart races.

328 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - PASSPORT CONTROL -- NIGHT 328 
      The Brennans approach passport control. Lara glances at
      John, sees he is sweating and red. She slips her hand into
      his and takes the passports.

 LARA                    I'll do this.

      She turns and smiles at the officer, putting on all her charm.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Hello.

      He remains stern-faced. Taking their passports, he examines
      them against PHOTOGRAPHS on his computer screen. He looks
      at them, looks at the passports again, then finally waves
      them through.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Thank you.

      As they step away, the passport officer turns, sees his
      replacement waiting. He stands and exits to take his break.

      The SECOND PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER takes his seat and motions
      for the next traveler to approach. As they do an ALERT comes
      on his computer screen. He taps on it -- and up comes
      photographs of LARA and JOHN.


 (CONTINUED) 111. 
328 CONTINUED: 328 
       He notes them, taps the screen again and the two take their
       place beside the others on the watch list. He motions for
       the traveler to hand over her passport.

 ANGLE ON THE BRENNANS 
       walking away.

329 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 329 
       The phones are quiet. Alone, Harris stares at the portion
       of the wall that he assembled. Collero enters.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Too bad you didn't find more of it.

 SGT. HARRIS                     Yeah. And wish I could figure out
                    where this is.

       He points to a small torn photo, taped back together.

 SGT. HARRIS (CONT'D)                     I checked websites for every tourist
                    destination I could --

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     That's the presidential palace.
                        (Harris turns & stares)
                    It was all over CNN. When they
                    deposed...what's-his-name.

       John, Lara and Luke walk down the jetway, until they are                   
       stopped by the crowd of passengers before them. John tries                 
       not to show how nervous he really is.                                      

332A INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - GATES -- NIGHT 332A 
       Airport Security runs up to the gate and pushes past the                   
       boarding passengers, searching their faces. The Airport                    
       Security Chief strides past the passengers and onto the                    
       jetway, the pages of photographs in his hand.                              

333 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 333 
       Nabulsi waits in silence on the other end of a phone.     The
       room is full, no one speaks.

334 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT 334 
       A second AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER squeezes along the wall,                 
       passing the waiting passengers. We pan to see Luke's brightly              
       colored roller-board. Our hearts stop; it is all over.                     

335 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 335 
       Nabulsi waits on the other line for an eternity.    Finally:               

 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)                   Sorry. There is no one by their
                  description on the flight.

 LT. NABULSI                   They're on it. Do you have the                                  
                  photographs?

       The young AIR CANADA FLIGHT ATTENDANT kneels to help the                   
       child with the colorful rollerboard -- we see it's a FIVE                  
 YEAR-OLD GIRL. 
 AIR CANADA ATTENDANT                   Can I take this for you?                                        

 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (V.O.)                   We have the photographs. They aren't

 LT. NABULSI                    ....No.   Thank you.

      Nabulsi hangs up, defeated.     Quinn stares out the window,
      deep in thought.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    It's starting to rain.

      Nabulsi looks at him as if he's nuts.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    I'll call the FBI.

      Collero exits, Quinn turns and looks at the partial "wall."

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    You ask yourself why we found this
                   bag and not the others?

338 INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT 338 
      Lara looks up from her son, sees her husband staring out the

       coastline below. Lara and Luke sleep beside him.

343 EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY 343 
       More rain. Detective Quinn squats in the covered parking lot,              
       staring at the spot where the crime took place. Flash to:                  

344 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 344 
       Elizabeth turns at her car, is slammed in the head with the
       extinguisher and she falls dead.

       The extinguisher is tossed to the floor and rolls.

       A YOUNG FEMALE JUNKIE yanks at Elizabeth's purse, getting                  
       blood on her hands before she frees it. She looks like a                   
       junkie. She runs off toward the sidewalk.                                  

344A QUINN - IN THE PRESENT 344A 
       Turns and sees...                                                          

344B LARA - IN THE PAST 344B 
       She hurries along the sidewalk to get out of the rain.                     
       Turning the corner into the garage she COLLIDES with the                   
       JUNKIE. Lara's purse catches the woman's coat.                             

       The JUNKIE puts her hand on Lara's shoulder, leaving a SMUDGE              
       OF ELIZABETH'S BLOOD on Lara's raincoat. She tugs free. A                  
       BUTTON from the woman's coat POPS OFF and hits the sidewalk.

       Lara turns and yells "Hey," then keeps going.

       She is about to get in the car when she sees the fire
       extinguisher in front of her left wheel. She picks it up,
       turns, annoyed. She places it down by the wall.

344B CONTINUED: 344B 
       Lara gets in her car and drives off, oblivious to Elizabeth's           
       body lying on the concrete floor on the passenger's side.

       Her co-worker sees her drive off as he steps into the garage.           
       He spots the body and turns and looks after Lara's car.                 

345 EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY 345 
       Quinn puts his used gum in a wrapper. COLLERO watches from              
       the car as her partner walks to the corner of the building.             
       QUINN steps up to where the two women collided and looks                
       down at the sidewalk.                                                   

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Was it raining when we searched the                        
                    crime scene?

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     Three years ago?? What are we doing
                    here?

       Quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk. It hits a                
       stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes                
       away. Quinn watches it -- then follows... Collero shakes                
       her head, grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows.

       The gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and                
       travels to the storm drain a half a block away.

       Quinn gets there, kneels.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Act like a cop. Grab the other side.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     You're out of your mind.

       Quinn jerks the grate up.    Collero grabs the other side and
       helps him lift.

       They stare down into the hole. Quinn runs his hand along
       the lip, digging up the mud and sediment...finds nothing.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)                     You really thought you were going to
                    find it?

       Collero wipes her hands on a tissue as Quinn stares down the
       hole a little longer, then lets the grate fall.

      Just before the grate clangs we see JUNKIE'S JACKET BUTTON,

346 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - SOUTH AMERICA -- EVENING 346 
      The taxi crosses the ancient square of a small town.

347 INT. COLONIAL HOTEL -- EVENING 347 
      The room has two single beds. John waits at the bathroom
      door. Lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them.

      She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past
      him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara
      lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face
      to face with her sleeping son.

      Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first
      time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her
      wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness.

348 INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 348 
      John washes, trying not to look in the mirror, not wanting
      to glimpse the man he has become.

349 INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 349 
      Lara and Luke sleep, spooning. John sits on the other bed.
      He picks up the TV remote and flips through Spanish language
      stations. And there it is: CNN in English. Sports right
      now, but John knows there is no place they can hide.

350 INT. BAR -- DAY 350 
      Damon takes the money from John's wallet, leaves him with a
      twenty.

 DAMON                    Good luck.

      Damon leaves him there. As John wonders if he is capable of
      doing this, we cut to BLACK. Read:

INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.

                         GUIDO
            You kill your film several times,
            mostly by talking about it. A film is
            a dream. You kill it writing it down,
            you kill it with a camera; the film
            might come to life for a moment or two
            when your actors breathe life back
            into it - but then it dies again,
            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,
            sometimes, in the editing room, a
            miracle happens when you place one
            image next to another so that when,
            finally, an audience sits in the dark,
            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and
            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream
            flickers back to life again. That's
            why I'm secretive.

                         REPORTER (O.S.)
            So what's your favorite pasta?

            Finally, a serious question.

Laughter.   A word:

                        NINE

INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT

A huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a
man into the stage, turns on a working light.

SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965

                         STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT
            Good luck, Maestro.

Departing, he closes the soundstage door.

As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of
light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.
GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the
world. In front of him:

AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under
construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its
unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.
Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open
platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A
lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane
surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.
                                    p. 2



Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts
on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the
stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping
over to the crane.

Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his
mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in
every sense a jumble of ideas.

Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the
bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,
overwhelmed.

THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES

                       GUIDO (V.O.)
          Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...
          How do you begin? How do you begin
          this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page
          1... Page nothing...

In the distance, a figure approaches out of the
darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An
escape from his tortured reality.

The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is
gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his
film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she
stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,
and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music
swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the
air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something
beautiful, transforms into the interior world of
GUIDO'S FANTASY.

As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly
appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the
women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from
his films, women he has loved, the sources of his
inspiration and creative genius.

A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women
in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own
powerful entrance:

LUISA, his wife

CARLA, his mistress

LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice

GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit

STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist

SARAGHINA, a whore

A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido
and he loses himself and his anxiety in their
collective embrace.


INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY

The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,
as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting
Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight
penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,
discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures
approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-
fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime
associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure
accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an
accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious
punctuation:

                       DANTE
                 (walking)
          Guido! You're here.

                       GUIDO
          Buongiorno, Dante.

                       DANTE
          I've been looking for you all over the
          place. The set's coming along. How
          are you?

                       GUIDO
          Bene, grazie, bene.

Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.

                       DANTE
          Bene. My God, you look terrible,
          better go to makeup, forget you've got
          a press conference?

                       FAUSTO
                 (discreetly, to Dante)
          He has no tie.

                       DANTE
          Yes, makeup and wardrobe.

He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.
Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look
and a gesture asks Dante who is he?

                       FAUSTO
                 (overlapping Dante)
          Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good
          morning, Signor Contini.
                                       p. 4



                       DANTE
                 (interrupts)
          He's counting costs, you know. The
          Bank wants him here.
                 (to Fausto)
          Don't speak to him, I speak to him.

                       FAUSTO
          Okay, I have some questions for Signor
          Contini.

                       GUIDO
          We all have questions for Signor
          Contini.

They head outside.


EXT. CINECITTA - DAY

Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en
route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large
poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a
failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido
passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod
deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.

                       FAUSTO
          Yes, but please, please, I think it's
          customary for there to be an approved
          script and budget before filming
          commences...

                       GUIDO
          Is he going to follow us?

                       FAUSTO
          It's not my intention to be difficult.
          Maestro, I am a huge admirer of
          Maestro Contini's movies, your early
          films are...everybody loves them
          and... I consider it a great honour
          for me to be here now... none the
          less, I need a script and a budget.

Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.
They make their way to the Production Offices.
Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.


INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY

A long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio
heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are
several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without
missing a beat of their solemn conversation.
                                       p. 5


As they progress into and through the open plan office,
many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to
get Guido's attention, swelling the procession,
interjecting with their urgent requests.

There are set models everywhere, in the process of
being constructed, or painted.

JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a
model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.

As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to
look.

PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the
procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting
through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a
partitioned office -

                       PIERPAOLO
          Where do you want your messages?

                        GUIDO
          On my desk.

                       PIERPAOLO
          There's no room on your desk.

- into the main office -

                       GUIDO
          Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo
          so.

                       PIERPAOLO
                 (waving them at him)
          Some of these are urgent!

                       GUIDO
                 (to Pierpaolo)
          Get me a cigarette.

                       JACONELLI
                 (confidentially)
          We will never be ready to shoot in ten
          days.

                        GUIDO
          Jaconelli -

                       FAUSTO
                 (at the same time)
          Not ready?!

                       GUIDO
                 (continues)
          Ascolta me.
                       (MORE)
                                    p. 6

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
                 (he kisses Jaconelli on
                  the cheek)
          Careful what you say. He's a spy from
          the bank.

Guido carries on moving through the office.

                       DANTE
          He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.

Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards
Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head
towards Guido's office.

                       BENITO
          Dottore, Dottore. You have actors
          waiting for you in your office.
          Auditions all morning. You should see
          what I've found. I found two sisters.
          Look, they're right...

Guido turns through another partition, as they all
besiege him with questions. Benito despairs.

                       BENITO (CONT'D)
          Dottore, this way...

Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the
door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him.

Dante blocks Benito.

                       BENITO (CONT'D)
          Maestro!

                       DANTE
          Not now. He's got the Press
          Conference.


INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY

Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the
barrage.

They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always,
for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is
Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,
indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without
any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido
heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting
some fabric.

                       GUIDO
          I need a cigarette.

Dante comes in, closing the door behind him.
                                      p. 7



                       DANTE
          He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.

Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to
Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.

                       GUIDO
          I need a coffee and a cigarette.

He lies down.

                       LILLI
                 (unimpressed)
          Answer a question, I'll give you a
          coffee. Answer another question, I'll
          give you a cigarette. And so on.

                       GUIDO
          Actually and an aspirin.

Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some
drawings.

                       DANTE
                 (in the background, on the
                  phone)
          We're running late...

                       LILLI
                 (turns to Guido and lights
                  a cigarette)
          Calm down. Directing a movie is a very
          overrated job, we all know it. You
          just have to say yes or no. What else
          do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should
          this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More
          extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes,
          no, yes, no, yes, no - that's
          directing.

Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.

                       GUIDO
          That's right: that's directing. And it
          doesn't seem to make a blind bit of
          difference, finally, what the answer
          is...

                       LILLI
          So please, Guido, yes or no, do you
          want any costumes in this film?

                       GUIDO
          Yes.
                                      p. 8



                       LILLI
          You see - simple!
                 (handing him an espresso
                  fetched by her assistant,
                  ROBERTA)
          Might I know what period the movie's
          in?

Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the
table, he looks at the costumes.

                       GUIDO
          Yes, yes.
                 (downs the espresso)
          Soon.

Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.

                       LILLI
          You know I don't allow producers in
          here.

                       DANTE
          Alright. Two minutes Guido.

Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He
leaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket.


Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits
up. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.

                       LILLI
          He's gone. Have you written a word of
          the script?

                       GUIDO
          No.

                       LILLI
          Are you in a panic?

                       GUIDO
          Yes.

She ties Guido's tie for him.

                       LILLI
          Is Luisa going with you to the Press
          Conference?

                       GUIDO
          No. Nobody. Dante.    And his spy.

                       LILLI
          You need to shave.    You look terrible.
                                      p. 9



                       GUIDO
                 (looking around,
                  desperate)
          Why is there no fire escape in here?
          What if somebody needed to escape? I
          can't face these reporters. I have
          nothing to say.

                       LILLI
          You'll be fine. You're a world class
          liar, darling, go out there and lie
          for Italy, lie for Italia.


EXT. ROME - DAY

Guido is driving his Roadster   through the streets of
Rome. An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the
radio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo. In
front of him in the convoy is   Dante with Fausto.


INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY

As Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the
passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She
appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is
extraordinary.

                       GUIDO
          What the hell's wrong with me? I
          can't sleep. I can't think. I can't
          write. I can't breathe. My heart is
          racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you
          flowers, I know. I'll come to the
          cemetery at the weekend. You should
          have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I
          could visit you every week. Don't
          look at me like that.

                       MAMMA
                 (with kindly patience)
          Oh, Guido, Guido.

He stops at a busy intersection.


EXT. STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY

This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas,
skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young
people. A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are
stuffed with the beautiful and chic.
                                     p. 10



                       MAMMA
          This is your Rome, Guido. The world
          sees Rome the way you invented it.
          Your films did that.

                       GUIDO
                 (buoyed by her
                  encouragement)
          I miss you.

                       MAMMA
          I miss you, too.

Guido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the
bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone
in the car.

Guido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone.


EXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY

The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel
Excelsior on the Via Veneto.

As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting
paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at
him. Guido moves quickly by them.

Dante and the team hurry after him.   Fausto tackles
Dante.

And they hurry after Guido.


INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

A big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are
in the room, and an array of microphones are on a
coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A
RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background.

                       RADIO REPORTER
          And we're just waiting for the arrival
          of Contini...any moment now - Could
          this film put the Maestro back on top?

A few news cameras are filming.    There's a buffet, and
a bartender.

And Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting
shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the
team follow him in.

                       RADIO REPORTER (CONT'D)
          And here he is..!
                                   p. 11



                       DANTE
          Silenzio, per favore...Thank you,
          thank you...

                       RADIO REPORTER
          Dante, Guido Contini's long time
          producer, is about to speak...

                       DANTE
          I want to say a few words from my
          heart. I am humbled and thrilled to
          be able to announce that I am
          producing Guido Contini's next film,
          Italia, which will star once again
          Contini's longtime inspiration, the
          international film star, Claudia
          Jenssen...

A stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen
emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM
DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement.

                       DANTE (CONT'D)
          ...we start shooting in ten days time
          in Cinecitta. That makes it one week
          from Monday.
                 (to Guido, handing over)
          Thank you, Maestro, thank you very
          much. This is our ninth film
          together. Guido Contini.

                       GUIDO
          Thanks for coming, everybody.

Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and
kisses Dante on the cheek.

He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their
questions at once. The questions come on top of each
other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated
energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to
DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.

                       DINARDO
          Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini.

                       GUIDO
          Yes.

                       DINARDO
          Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new
          film is called Italia... big title.

Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to
her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt.
                                      p. 12



                       GUIDO
          Actually, it's my shortest title yet.

                       DINARDO
          But hardly a modest one.

                       GUIDO
          Films are not modest. They cost too
          much, they take too long, and they
          involve too many people. So they
          should have grand titles.

                       DINARDO
          And might you tell the press what the
          film is about?

                       GUIDO
          Why? I still don't know what my last
          film was about.

                       LEOPARDI
                 (In a loud aside to
                  Dinardo)
          That was the problem. Nobody else did.

                       GUIDO
          Of course I can tell you what my film
          is about...I can tell you the story, I
          can tell you who I am going to cast,
          the music I want to use, I can tell
          you everything... but... I... won't.
          I'm afraid that if I say anything, the
          word might get out to the Press.

General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is
clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps
in.

                       DANTE
          Our next film will be exactly as it
          sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit
          of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a
          woman, Italy as a dream.

                       LEOPARDI
          Is this true?

                       GUIDO
          It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to
          see it.

He's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points
to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes
from American Vogue.   Flirtatious and charming, she
wants him and he senses it.
                                    p. 13



                       STEPHANIE
          Signor Contini.

                       GUIDO
          Stephanie.

                       STEPHANIE
          Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable
          women of America who your favorite
          designer is this year?

                       GUIDO
          I'm less interested in the wrapping
          than what might be inside it.

                       REPORTER ONE
          Signor Contini! You're a man of the
          world, yes? Educated in Britain, a
          home in Biarritz. With Italia is it
          fair to say that you've come home for
          good?

                       REPORTER TWO (O.S.)
                 (tries to interrupt)
          What do you think of the New Wave in
          the French Cinema?

                       GUIDO
          For good?

                       REPORTER FOUR
          It's been a long time since you made a
          movie with your wife, do you plan on
          casting her in this new film?

Guido is spinning plates.

                       GUIDO
          I told Luisa that when we got married
          I would never again make love to my
          leading lady.

                       REPORTER FOUR
          But she hasn't worked at all since
          working with you.

Laughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido
again. Another REPORTER asks a question.

                       REPORTER FIVE
          But why are you being so tight-lipped
          about this film? It's a serious
          question. What's the big deal?
                                       p. 14



FANTASY:


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

We discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his
unfinished set. A retreat into surreality. He sits on
the same couch from the hotel suite. He slouches, arms
folded, legs crossed, with his hat pulled over his
eyes.

                        GUIDO
           I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE.


INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY

                        GUIDO
           You want me to be serious? In a Press
           Conference?


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

                        GUIDO
           I WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE


INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY

                        GUIDO
           I thought I was the clown in this
           circus.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

                        GUIDO
           I WOULD LIKE TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
           I KNOW THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN
           TERMS.


INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY

                        LEOPARDI
           Signor Contini. Artists do their best
           work before they're famous. Now
           you're famous. Without wishing to be
           negative - but your last two films,
           they're not, they were...

                       GUIDO
           Flops.

                        LEOPARDI
           Your word. Flops.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

                       GUIDO
          AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN
          MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS
          NEARING TEN.


INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY

                       LEOPARDI
          I'm just asking if you're nervous?
          You seem nervous...

This stops Guido. He doesn't answer. We see a bead of
sweat running down the back of Guido's neck.

Everyone waits.

                       GUIDO
          Excuse me?

                       LEOPARDI
          What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you
          run out of things to say?


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

As the number progresses, Guido gets up from his chair
and begins to scale the enormous heights of his
unfinished set, with great effort.

                       GUIDO
          I CAN HARDLY STAY UP
          AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP,
          AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROW
          MORNING,
          AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP
          BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY?
          AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE
          HERE - ONLY ME
          I WANT TO BE YOUNG.
          AND I WANT TO BE OLD.
          I WOULD LIKE TO BE WISE BEFORE MY TIME
          AND YET BE FOOLISH AND BRASH AND BOLD.
          I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN
          ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, "GUIDO,
          WHATEVER YOU PLEASE,
          IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
          WE'LL ARRANGE IT."
          THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

                       STEPHANIE
          I was wondering if you think there's a
          limit to what you can show in a movie.

                       GUIDO
          What would you like to see that I
          haven't already shown you?

She smiles, he smiles back, lighting his cigarette.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

                       GUIDO
          I AM LUSTING FOR MORE,
          SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS?
          I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR
          IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS?
          ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET:
          THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET.


INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

Guido turns to the mantle. He grabs a bottle of
whiskey, looks up into the large gilded mirror at his
reflection. We see two Guidos.

                       GUIDO (V.O.)
          I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ME TO
          TRAVEL ALONG WITH MYSELF.
          I WOULD EVEN LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SING A
          DUET WITH MYSELF.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY

Amidst the chaos, Guido notices a waiter with a tray of
glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the
wall. As the waiter passes, Guido slyly opens the door
and sneaks out.

                       GUIDO (V.O.)
          ...OR THE MARQUIS DE SADE.
          I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRIST, MOHAMMED,
          BUDDHA
          BUT NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD.
          AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WITH ALL OF MY
          HEART -
          IT'S THE END IF SOMETHING IMPORTANT
          DOESN'T START...


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Guido continues climbing higher and higher.

                       GUIDO
          ...I WANT TO BE YOUNG,
          BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD.
          WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND AND
          FURY
          THAT SOME IDIOT WENT AND TOLD.
          I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN
          ON ITS KNEES
          AND SAY, "GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE,
          IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S RIDICULOUS,
          WE'LL ARRANGE IT..."


INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY

Guido slips through the hallway, down the grand lobby
staircase, and escapes.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

                       GUIDO
          SO ARRANGE IT!

As Guido reaches the pinnacle of his Everest-like set,
Guido's WOMEN appear on the different levels.

                        WOMEN
          ARRANGE IT!

                       GUIDO
          THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT!
                                      p. 18




EXT. ROME - DAY

Guido speeds away from Rome in his Roadster.


EXT. ROME ROAD - DAY

Guido's car passes by the remnants of an ancient
aqueduct, with women from his fantasy draped around
him, spilling out of his car.

THE WOMEN sing a musical flourish of praise to Guido.

                       WOMEN (V.O.)
          CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI...


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON

Now Guido and his women are in the countryside.

                       WOMEN (V.O.)
          CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI, CONTINI...

The car races over a hill, blurring the countryside,
and we see the blue Mediterranean sea, and the pretty
spa town of ANZIO.


EXT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

                       WOMEN (V.O.)
          GUIDO!

The Alfa Spyder comes to a screeching stop in front of
the gates of the entrance of an impressive looking Spa:
GRAND HOTEL BELLAVISTA. The hotel has a slightly faded
glamour, something that lifts it a little out of time.
Guido's women are gone as the song ends.

SUPERTITLE: Bellavista Spa Hotel, Anzio, Italy


INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

Guido enters like a thief. He doesn't want to be
recognised. He approaches the Front Desk, where an
immaculate Desk Clerk, the urbane and wise DE ROSSI,
waits to greet him.

                       GUIDO
          I need a room.

                       DE ROSSI
          Of course.
                           p. 19



               GUIDO
A suite.

               DE ROSSI
Yes.

             GUIDO
With a view of the sea. A balcony.
Something with air.

             DE ROSSI
All of our suites have air... let me
just look for you.

             GUIDO
I've come from Milano.

             DE ROSSI
I understand.

               GUIDO
On business.    I'm a businessman. Busy
busy busy.

             DE ROSSI
       (without looking up)
Would Maestro Contini prefer to
register under a pseudonym?

             GUIDO
       (doleful)
Please.

             DE ROSSI
       (suggesting a name)
Signor Milano?

               GUIDO
Why not.

             DE ROSSI
       (continuing to work)
Needless to say, I love your films.
Guilty pleasure. Those early films.

             GUIDO
Not the flops.
       (anxious, confidential)
I need to see a doctor. Do you know
one who's discreet...? I'd like to
see him today, in my room, now, if
possible.

             DE ROSSI
Consider it done. Please.
                                     p. 20



                       GUIDO
                 (takes the key)
          And I need to place a call.   To my
          wife.

Guido writes the number on a piece of paper on the
desk.

                       DE ROSSI
          You can take the call at the lobby
          phone over there.


INT. TELEPHONE KIOSK, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

Guido heads into the elegant Art Deco booth, pulls the
glass door shut. The phone rings. He picks up.


INT. CONTINI HOME, ROME / TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY

We intercut between the phone booth and LUISA in their
apartment in Rome... Luisa knows every move of
Guido's. She manages him very well, calm, dry and
funny.

                       GUIDO
          Luisa, tesoro...

                       LUISA
          There you are.

                       GUIDO
          Is everybody mad at me?

                       LUISA
          Well, I'm mad at you.   Where are you?

                       GUIDO
          I had to escape from the Press
          Conference.

                       LUISA
          I heard. Dramatic.

                       GUIDO
          Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa.

                       LUISA
          You're making a film. You make a
          film, you get sick. It's what happens.

                       GUIDO
          No, but this time I'm really sick.      I
          can't breathe.
                           p. 21



             LUISA
Are you by yourself?

             GUIDO
Yes, of course I'm by myself.

             LUISA
Then shall I come?

             GUIDO
Yes, please come, that's why I'm
calling, please come straight away.
That would be wonderful.

              LUISA
Okay.

             GUIDO
Great. Marvellous.

             LUISA
I don't know where you are.

             GUIDO
I don't know, some spa.   Horrible.   I
just kept driving.

             LUISA
Well I can't come if I don't know
where you are.

             GUIDO
       (suddenly claustrophobic)
And, actually, it's hardly worth it.
I'll be home in a day or two.

             LUISA
       (all too familiar )
Yes, it's hardly worth it.

             GUIDO
But I do wish you were here.

             LUISA
Get some rest, take the waters, sleep,
then come back here and make a good
movie.

              GUIDO
I love you.

              LUISA
Get better.
                                      p. 22




INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

He hangs up, pensive. Goes straight back to De Rossi
at the Front Desk, and scribbles down another number.

                       DE ROSSI
          Your doctor is on his way.

                       GUIDO
                 (carefully)
          This number - if a woman answers you
          put it through to my room,
          otherwise...

De Rossi understands.

                       DE ROSSI
          It's a wrong number.


INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

...CLOSE-UP on Guido's eye, being held open by a
DOCTOR. Guido is on the bed, shirt open. The Doctor
examines Guido's eye while a heavy-set NURSE takes his
blood pressure. The Doctor stands and turns to his
case.

                        GUIDO
          What?

                        NURSE
          Dottore.

                        DOCTOR RONDI
          Si?

He walks round to her. The Nurse whispers to the
Doctor. They look at the blood pressure gauge. Guido
is disturbed by their conspiracy.

                       GUIDO
          What is she whispering? Is it my
          blood pressure? Is it serious? Am I
          dying?

                       DOCTOR
                 (to the Nurse, not
                  answering Guido)
          Check again.

The doctor, interrupting him, takes a tongue depressor
from his kit.

The doctor, sits on the bed beside Guido, and takes his
cigarette out of his mouth. He stubs it out.
                                     p. 23



                         DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Stress.    Exhaustion.

THE PHONE RINGS. The doctor is in the way of the phone.
Guido desperately makes an attempt to reach it and
can't. He's trapped by the doctor and by the nurse
holding his arm.

                       DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Your liver, your heart, your kidneys,
          they're all very cross with you,
          Signore.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

WE CUT TO A PAIR OF FULL BEAUTIFUL LIPS SINGING HIS
NAME.

                        CARLA
          GUIDO...

                        DOCTOR

          Open wide.

Guido opens wide, gagging, as the phone continues
ringing. Guido looks at the ringing phone, but the
nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood
pressure for the second time. And the phone continues
ringing.

                       DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          But you've come to the right place.
          There are a dozen mineral springs
          around the town...


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

NOW WE CUT TO A SUGGESTIVE LOOK FROM A HEAVILY MADE UP
EYE.

                        CARLA
          GUIDO...

                       DOCTOR
          ...the Roman emperors came here for
          the waters...

Guido lunges for the ringing phone, with the blood
pressure cuff still on his arm, and picks it up. It is
CARLA, at the perfect wrong time.

                       GUIDO
                 (into the phone)
          Pronto.

                        DE ROSSI (V.O.)
           Signor Contini, it's the Signora.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

WE SEE ISOLATED IMAGES OF A SEDUCTIVE BODY: A LONG LEG
IN SHEER BLACK STOCKINGS, A SHAPELY ASS, MAGNIFICENT
BREASTS.

                        CARLA
           I WAS LAZING AROUND MY BEDROOM WHEN
           YOU CALLED AND AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME
           I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING
           ABOUT, GUIDO...

                         GUIDO
                  (coming back quickly to
                   life)
           It's a very an important call, Doctor.
           I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private
           call.

                          DOCTOR
           As you wish.

FANTASY:


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

An enormous swathe of pink satin rakes across the
scaffolding of Guido's unfinished set. Emerging from
the highest point is a pair of long legs sliding down
the lush fabric. She wears stockings, heels and little
else. Bathed in hot light, Carla reveals herself from
inside the sumptuous folds of satin.

                        CARLA
           WHO'S NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES?
           I'M NOT!
           MY DARLING,
           WHO'S AFRAID TO KISS YOUR TOES?
           I'M NOT!
           YOUR MAMA DEAR IS BLOWING INTO YOUR
           EAR,
           SO YOU'LL GET IT LOUD AND CLEAR,
           I NEED YOU TO SQUEEZE ME HERE...
           AND HERE...
           AND HERE...


INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

The Nurse, still taking his blood pressure and
listening to his pulse, is concerned about Guido's
vital signs.
                                   p. 25



                       NURSE
          Doctor... His pulse... it's racing.

                       DOCTOR
                 (to Guido)
          Is something wrong?

                       GUIDO
          What? Yes, yes. It's about my film.
          It's from the Vatican. Go ahead,
          Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm
          listening.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Carla slides from the lush fabric onto a mirrored
platform. As she sings, she writhes and undulates in a
seductive display of sexuality. This is Guido's
ultimate fantasy.

                       CARLA
          COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE COO.
          I'VE GOT
          A PLAN FOR WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU,
          SO HOT
          YOU'RE GONNA STEAM, AND SCREAM, AND
          VIBRATE LIKE A STRING I'M PLUCKING-
          KISS YOUR FEVERED LITTLE BROW
          PINCH YOUR CHEEKS TILL YOU SAY "OW,"
          AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SHOW YOU HOW,
          GUIDO.


INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

Guido trying to hide the effects of this phone sex from
the Doctor and Nurse.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Carla grabs onto two satin-covered ropes, suspended
from the ceiling. She wraps herself in them, swinging
and gyrating.

                       CARLA
          WHO WON'T CARE IF YOU COME TO ME TIRED
          AND OVERWORKED?
          I WON'T! BAMBINO,
          WHO KNOWS A THERAPY TO BEAT WHAT YOU
          CAN GET FROM ME?
          I DON'T!
          BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH FOR
          NOW,
          GUIDO,
          CIAO.
                       (MORE)
                                      p. 26

                       CARLA (CONT'D)
                 (spoken)
          I love you, Guido.

Carla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes
the steam from an arriving train.


EXT. ANZIO, TRAIN STATION - DAY

And out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward
Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her,
pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her
own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido
likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She
wears it with pride.

                         CARLA
          Guido!    Ciao!

                         GUIDO
                   (to himself, remembering
                    how much work she is)
          Carla.
                   (and now to her, covering
                    his ambivalence)
          Carla!

                       CARLA
          I'm so happy to see you.

                         GUIDO
          Carlissima.

She gives him a hug and a kiss, both too much for him
in public.

                       CARLA
          I missed you so much.
                 (they move off)
          Are you happy I'm here?

                         GUIDO
          Of course.

                       CARLA
          But very happy? Or just a little
          happy?

                         GUIDO
          Very happy.

She sees something in his face that worries her.

                       CARLA
          What's wrong? You look very tired,
          very tired.
                                    p. 27



                       GUIDO
                 (avoiding this, looks at
                  her bags)
          Carla, all those bags for the weekend?

                       CARLA
          Yes, the Bellavista is a very
          fashionable place. You know I stayed
          there with my parents, during the war,
          it was full of Germans.

                       GUIDO
          Carla... I have to tell you... they
          found out who I am at the hotel--

                       CARLA
          No...

                       GUIDO
          ... yes, horrible, but obviously we
          don't want to be followed by the
          press, so I found the most charming
          pensione for you, and it's right here.
          It's charming.

                       CARLA
          Here at the station?


EXT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - DAY

A small pensione across the street from the station.
Carla sizes it up, and it's really not at all what she
was hoping for, but she doesn't say anything.


INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

Later, Carla, in silhouette, from behind. Wrapped in a
sheet, she is looking out the window of the dingy room.
The light from the pensione's neon sign spills in. They
whisper.

                       GUIDO (O.S.)
          Close the curtains, it's too light in
          here.

Carla closes the curtains.     They continue to whisper.

                        GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Perfect.   Now, go into the corridor---

                       CARLA
          What?
                                    p. 28



                       GUIDO
          Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back
          in, and pretend you're in the wrong
          room, and I'm a complete stranger--

Carla sits on the bed facing Guido.

                       CARLA
          I love your games!

She kisses him.

                       GUIDO
          I'm here on business.

                       CARLA
          Okay.

                        GUIDO
          Go, go.   Wait. Your face.

                       CARLA
          What about it?

                       GUIDO
          Get your makeup.

Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and
tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a
beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous
about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it
exactly as he wants it.

                       CARLA
          I had a nightmare last night. We were
          in that little alley behind Piazza
          Navona, where I bought you that scarf,
          remember? The same one your wife
          bought you--

                       GUIDO
                 (probably doesn't)
          Don't move, Carla.

                       CARLA
          When you wear it, I never know if it's
          hers or mine.

                       GUIDO
                 (not really listening)
          Uh-huh.

                       CARLA
          So we were there, on the ground,
          naked, kissing, and we didn't care,
          and then my husband arrived and killed
          us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi!

                                   p. 29

                       CARLA (CONT'D)
          He would never do that! He's so sweet.
          He speaks Latin! He knows all the
          Roman Emperors.

                       GUIDO
                 (still intent on his
                  makeup job)
          Good for him.

                       CARLA
          Perhaps there's a job for him in the
          movie--

                         GUIDO
          Why not?

                       CARLA
          You could work well together.

                       GUIDO
          Beautiful. When you come in I want
          you to be my little savage.

                         CARLA
          Yes.

                        GUIDO
                 (gesturing towards the
                  door)
          Go, go.

Guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side
table..

                       CARLA
          You think I am one of your actresses?

                       GUIDO
          Hurry, please, Carla.

Carla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her. Guido
turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for
the game. Carla looks at herself in the mirror.

                         CARLA
          Oh, Madonna!

                       GUIDO
          I'll pretend to be asleep.

Carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's
glasses and turns back to him.

                       CARLA
          What if I really found the wrong room?
          Would you be jealous?
                                   p. 30



                       GUIDO
          Could you do such a thing?

Carla teases him with a look that says, "Why not?"

                       CARLA
                 (coyly)
          Hm! Who knows?

Carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind
her. We HEAR the MATRON who runs the Pensione talking
to her. While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from
the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer.

Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling
for Guido to keep quiet.

                       GUIDO
          What happened?

                       CARLA
                 (still giggling)
          It was the woman from the hotel. She
          wanted to give me towels.

                       GUIDO
          Come here.

                       CARLA
          Okay.

                       GUIDO
          What?

                       CARLA
          You are a stranger, I don't know you.

                       GUIDO
          Carla, just come here.
                 (indicating her sheet)
          Be savage. Show me.

She crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens
the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide.

                       CARLA
          Excuse me! I've got the wrong room.

                       GUIDO
          Yes, you have. And I don't have the
          faintest idea who you are.

She throws herself on Guido, whose arms enfold her.
                                     p. 31




INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - LATER

Carla is asleep, her bare back a thing of post-coital
beauty. Guido sits on the edge of the bed, quietly
getting dressed, filled with confusion and guilt.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido tip-toes out of Carla's room, shoes in his hand.
He walks down the hallway, alone.

                       GUIDO (V.O.)
          Page one, page one, page one...
          The figure emerges from the darkness
          like a goddess. She is Claudia, his
          muse...


INT. HOTEL, GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

IMAGES OF CLAUDIA in his fantasy.   Kissing him.
Walking away...

                       GUIDO (V.O.)
          She takes the man's face and kisses
          him...

Guido is surrounded by discarded bits of paper, an
outline of Italia. An empty sheet of paper sits in his
typewriter on his desk. He is not working on the
outline. He is sketching a voluptuous woman...

                       GUIDO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...And with that gesture, he's
          suddenly inspired to write
          something... profound.

...he draws in the nipples on the woman's breasts.

Guido becomes discouraged. He tosses off his glasses
and runs his hands through his hair in frustration.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Mother of God, give me a sign.

He's happily distracted by the sound of vehicles
arriving outside his window. He opens a slat in the
shutters, looks down as a motor calvacade draws up. At
its heart is an impressive luxury car.
                                     p. 32




EXT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA, POV FROM BALCONY - DAY

Hotel staff swarm around the vehicles which discharge a
procession of religious, including an ANCIENT CARDINAL
in scarlet robes and the CARDINAL'S SECRETARY. Priests
follow as the Cardinal heads inside the hotel.

Guido is intrigued, hurries out of his hotel room.


INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA LOBBY - DAY

As Guido hurries down the stairs, the Cardinal is being
helped into the elevator. The CARDINAL'S SECRETARY is
dealing with check-in formalities with De Rossi. Guido
calls to him.

                       GUIDO
          Excuse me, father...

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
                 (turns)
          Buongiorno.

                       GUIDO
          His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -?

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
                 (recognising Guido)
          Signor Contini!
                 (starstruck)
          I am a big fan.

                       GUIDO
          I would very much like to speak to the
          Cardinal. Do you think he might grant
          me -

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Is Claudia Jenssen with you?

                       GUIDO
          No.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Pity. His excellency is a big admirer
          of Signorina Jenssen.

                       GUIDO
                 (explaining)
          I'm in need of some guidance, some
          pointers...

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Do you think you could find a signed
          photograph of Signorina Jenssen?
                                        p. 33



                       GUIDO
          For His Excellency?

                        CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Si.

                       GUIDO
          I'm sure that would be possible...

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Truly?   What a pleasure. Arrivederci,
          Maestro.

He heads towards the elevator. Guido watches him go,
then a voice calls out his name....GUIDO! Guido can't
turn round. He knows that voice.

                        DANTE
          Guidino!

Guido hurries towards the elevator. The elevator doors
close. Guido is trapped.

                       GUIDO
          I'm not going to ask how you found me.

                       DANTE
          Please - it's my job. A producer
          needs to know where his director is at
          all times...even to know the pensione
          where his mistress is staying...

                        GUIDO
          Oh God.

                       DANTE
          I understand, Guido. Rome is
          absolutely unbearable. The pressure.
          It's no good.

                         GUIDO
          Really?    You understand?

He takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell.


INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - STAIRCASE - DAY

                       DANTE
          Of course I understand.      Absolutely.

                       GUIDO
          You're not going to drag me back?

                       DANTE
          No. You're a genius and genius must be
          served.
                                     p. 34



                       GUIDO
          Thank you, my old friend.
                 (Dante is guiding him)
          Where are we going?

                       DANTE
          You can't be in Rome. Okay.
                 (heading towards the
                  ballroom)


INT. GRAND BALLROOM, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

                       DANTE
          Rome will come to you!

Dante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full
PRODUCTION OFFICE, ART DEPARTMENT, COSTUME DEPARTMENT,
CASTING OFFICE. The models, costumes, headshots,
everything all in place or being put into place. An
absolute beehive of activity. Guido is staggered.

                       DANTE (CONT'D)
          It's a fantastic place for you to
          focus. Everyone is here to help the
          movie. Everyone is here because they
          love you, Guido.

He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he
sets to work with his team. Guido moves through the
room avoiding specific questions from everyone. As he
does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a
magnificent girl on his arm.

                       JACONELLI
                 (explaining his designs)
          Yes, with the flower and the glass and
          the arches of the Roman Empire...

                       DANTE
          Guido...you remember Donatella.

                        DONATELLA
          Ciao.

                        GUIDO
                  (he doesn't, she's new)
          Ciao.

                       DANTE
          Donatella, you tested her.

                       DONATELLA
          I was very nervous. He probably
          doesn't remember. I was quite
          nervous.
                                     p. 35



                       GUIDO
                 (distracted, taking it all
                  in)
          No, I remember you. You were, we all
          enjoyed you, so to speak.

                        PIERPAOLO
          Maestro...

Pierpaolo, Guido's assistant, holds a telephone.   Guido
wants to know who it is.

                       PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)
          Claudia's agent...

Guido grimaces. Then takes the phone.   He attacks the
phone call with gusto.

                       GUIDO
                  (listens to a stream of
                  invective)
          Did she like the script?
                 (gestures for Pierpaolo to
                  light him a cigarette)
          No no no no - impossibile - are you
          telling me she didn't get the script?
                 (shouting at Pierpaolo)
          Pierpaolo!

He takes the cigarette with a smile, and then without
missing a beat starts barking at Pierpaolo.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Claudia didn't get the script! Send
          her another one. For Chrissake. Send
          her two!

                       PIERPAOLO
                 (playing along)
          Yes, I'm sorry. Right now.

                       GUIDO
          Cretino!
                 (back to Lombardo,
                  listens)
          Yes, yes, that's what I say, people
          just don't realise - she's an actress
          as well as a star - I know Dante's
          dying to talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao.

He hands the phone to Dante, who's delighted to see
Guido back on good directing mode.

                        DANTE
          Lombardo...
                                    p. 36



As Dante takes over, Guido walks away, heads towards
Lilli and her domain.


INT. LILLI'S TEMPORARY OFFICE, BALLROOM - DAY

                       GUIDO
          Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!

Guido leaps over the balcony and lies down on a table.
Performance mode off. Lilli nods to Roberta to leave.
Roberta puts down her work and clears the room quietly,
leaving them alone.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          What are we doing here?

                       LILLI
          I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit.

Lilli is working at a mannequin, hand-sewing some
sequins on a costume. A red feathered boa is draped on
the figure.

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          It was Luisa's birthday yesterday.

                       GUIDO
          What? No. Oh please God. No. I
          spoke with her yesterday. She didn't
          even mention it. Give me a cigarette.

Lilli points to the one in Guido's hand.

                          LILLI
          What's that?

Guido sees the costume.

                          GUIDO
          What's that?

                       LILLI
          It's for Claudia.

                       GUIDO
          For which scene?

                       LILLI
          Well I don't know which scene until
          I`ve seen the script, but she always
          likes something like this, or you do.

                       GUIDO
          Looks like the Folies Bergere. It's
          wrong. Italian women don't wear those
          things.
                                    p. 37



                       LILLI
          Don't knock the Folies Bergere...

Lilli tosses the boa over her shoulder as she continues
pinning the costume.

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          ...it brings back happy memories.
          That's where I learned my art. All
          those sequins, all those feathers.
                 (Still working)
          And, you're wrong, you put Claudia
          in one of these for that nightclub
          scene in Natura Morta.

                       GUIDO
          Why did people love that film?

Guido picks up a straw hat. Puts it on his head
playfully.

                       LILLI
          Oh Guido, don't. That's death.     Every
          time we have to start again.

                       GUIDO
          I'm trying to find it.

                       LILLI
          You won't find it with your head
          jammed halfway up your ass.

                       GUIDO
          Ashtray.

She produces one.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Thanks. You were saying - my head is
          jammed up my ass.

                       LILLI
          Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream
          up something entertaining, Guido?
          Something with music...with dancing...
          God knows, we could use a little joie
          de vivre around here...

Guido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her
and sees...

FANTASY:


INT."SOUNDSTAGE"

...Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red
feathered boa hangs from her shoulders. She places the
same straw hat on her head.

The soundstage has been transformed into an
impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the
1930's, with Lilli as its French Star. A spotlight
finds Guido watching from the scaffolding of his
unfinished set. The din of the theater audience fills
the smoky atmosphere.

                        LILLI
                  (singing and performing in
                   a french accent)
           LE CINEMA TODAY IS IN A CRISIS
           DIRECTORS ARE SO EXISTENTIALISTES.
           THE MOVIES ARE
           NOT WORTH THEIR ENTRANCE PRICES
           IF NO ONE SINGS A LOVE SONG
           WHEN HE'S KISSED.
           LOVE CANNOT BE LOVE WITHOUT "LE
           SINGING,"
           A STRING, A CLARINET, A SAXOPHONE TAKE
           A LESSON FROM THIS OLD PARISIENNE
           AND THE FINEST ENTERTAINMENT SHE HAS
           KNOWN.

Behind a black scrim, ghostly images come to life.
Apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic SHOWGIRLS
barely covered in beads, sequins, and feathers. They
descend the grand staircase.

                        LILLI (CONT'D)
           FOLIES BERGERE-
           WHAT A SHOWING OF COLOR, COSTUME, AND
           DANCING!
           NOT A MOMENT IN LIFE COULD BE MORE
           ENTRANCING
           THAN AN EVENING YOU SPEND
           AUX FOLIES BERGERE.
           FOLIES BERGERE,
           NOT A SOUL IN THE WORLD COULD BE IN
           DESPAIR
           WHEN HE IS GLANCING
           AT THE FABULOUS STAGE
           DES FOLIES BERGERE

The showgirls disappear. Lilli comes down from the
piano and crosses onto the stage. The scrim rises.
From every corner, more showgirls begin to enter.
                                   p. 39



           LILY                           SHOWGIRLS

"ET PAS TROP CHER"
VIENS CE SOIR AVEC MOI
AUX FOLIES BERGERE.

Lilli crosses onto the passerelle, and speaks directly
to the audience.

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          Ah, Bon soir, bon soir, bon soir. Je
          suis la vedette des Folies Bergere.
          Vedette, it means 'star.'

Lilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage:

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          Let me tell you. Last night I looked
          down at this table in the chairs you
          are sitting in now, and what did I
          see? A priest! And next to him?

Suddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience.

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini?
          What are you doing here at the Folies
          Bergere? You naughty boy! You're
          only nine years old! But I'm glad
          you've come. Would you like to join
          me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come,
          come.

And she brings him onto the stage. The audience
applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older
Guido.

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          Feeling better? There's no room for
          hopelessness in here, is there, Guido?
                 (to the audience)
          We must explain something to our young
          Guido. What do we want? Laughter!
          What do we want? Love! What do we
          want? Dreams! Let us not forget,
          Guido, mon cher -- That's our
          privilege - to entertain.
                                   p. 40



The number kicks into full gear with a rousing can-can.
Young Guido finds himself swept into Lilli's
intoxicating world.

                       LILLI AND SHOWGIRLS
          FOLIES BERGERE
          THE MUSIC, THE LIGHTS, AND THE

                       LILLI AND SHOWGIRLS
          THAN THE FOLIES BERGERE

Lilli crosses the proscenium. Her boa grows and grows
until it stretches the length of the stage.

          AT THE FOLIES BERGERE!

Lilli wraps her long boa around Young Guido. He and
Lilli are lifted onto an art deco swing, flanked by two
showgirls, that rises into the air. He is transported
and inspired.

                       LILLI AND SHOWGIRLS

          LAUGHTER
          OF THE FOLIES BERGERE!


INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT

We seem to be looking at the SET ON STAGE 5. But
suddenly a HUGE HEAD dips into the shot and it's Guido
contemplating a model of the set. He places a figure
on the top of the staircase.
                                     p. 41


He moves round to the front of the model and places
another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. He
knocks it over.

Unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. The coffee
table is covered in head-shots. He finds the one of
Claudia.   Guido looks at it.

He lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S
LAP. She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his
hair. He starts to sign - "TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... "
then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself.
Claudia laughs.


INT. ANCIENT BATHS - DAY

Grottos and tunnels are thick with steam.    Guido
follows the Cardinal's Secretary.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          The Cardinal is right this way.

The Cardinal's Secretary leads Guido to a private area,
where the Cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of
hot water.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
                       (CONT'D)
          Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here.

The Cardinal's Secretary makes a gesture to Guido to
get into the tub with the Cardinal. Guido gets in the
water. The Cardinal looks hard at Guido and then makes
his first pronouncement.

                       CARDINAL
          I like Charlie Chaplin.

                       GUIDO
          Me too.

                       CARDINAL
          A genius. What can I do for you?

                       GUIDO
          Do you believe in God?

The Cardinal's Secretary is shocked.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Signor Contini, please.

                       CARDINAL
          No, no, it's an honest question.    Yes,
          I believe in God.
                                    p. 42



                        GUIDO
          So do I.

                       CARDINAL
          Are you a Catholic?

                       GUIDO
          Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as
          I would like to be, not as much as you
          would like me to be, I'm sure, but
          certainly yes, I'm trying.

                        CARDINAL
          Try harder.

                       GUIDO
          Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your
          Eminence, I am not happy. I'm
          searching for something. I feel a
          sense of misery, of despair and --

                       CARDINAL
                 (interrupting)
          I saw your films. Not the flops, the
          others, the good ones.
          But you think people need to see so
          much sex?   It's not necessary. We can
          all imagine.

                       GUIDO
                 (laughing)
          Excuse me - my films are what I
          imagine.

                       CARDINAL
          Then your imagination has no moral
          training.

                       GUIDO
                 (nonplussed)
          How do you train the imagination?

                       CARDINAL
          The imagination is God's garden; don't
          let the Devil play in it. Teach our
          Italian women to be wives, not whores,
          don't make us look at filth and
          debauchery. Make us proud to be
          Italian...

Guido's head disappears under the water.    The sound of
the Cardinal's voice trails away...
                                      p. 43



MEMORY:


EXT. BEACH - DAY

SUPERTITLE:   Pesaro, Italy, 1926

Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast
across the rough dunes with five boys from the village.

The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall
with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the
war.

They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand
it to Young Guido, already the ring leader.

They crawl through a small opening in the wall and
approach an abandoned bunker...


EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY

...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker,
as the other boys fearfully take a step back.

                       YOUNG GUIDO
                 (not loud enough)
          Saraghina.
                 (louder)
          Saraghina.

Now all the boys join in.

                        BOYS
          Saraghina!   Saraghina!

                       YOUNG GUIDO
                 (loudest)
          Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!

A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido
takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps
back.

And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy
woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has
darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the
model for the whore makeup on Carla.

She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but
she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the
boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having
her own fun with them.

She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his
ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand.
                                    p. 44



Young Guido opens his hand with the coins.

She looks at the money.   Is it enough?


But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes
the coins.

She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back
to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken
chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready
for the "show."

Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands
and pours it over her body...

A dark vamp begins.


FANTASY:


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage.

Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same
chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other
WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs.

                        SARAGHINA
           So, you little Italian devils, you
           want to know about love? Saraghina
           will tell you...and if you want to
           make a woman happy, you rely on what
           you were born with. Because it is in
           your blood.


EXT. BEACH - DAY

With a smile, she pulls her dress off her shoulders.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

                        SARAGHINA
                  (sings)
           BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.
           TAKE A CHANCE, AND TRY TO
           STEAL A FIERY KISS.
           BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.
           WHEN YOU HOLD ME, DON'T JUST HOLD ME
           BUT HOLD THIS!

She grabs her breasts.
                                   p. 45

She undulates her body. The boys watch and cheer.

                       SARAGHINA
          PLEASE BE GENTLE, SENTIMENTAL,
          GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GIVE MY CHEEK A
          PAT,

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Saraghina gets up on the chair, lifts her skirt, and
begins to move her hips.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Saraghina drops to the ground and playfully writhes in
the sand. The boys are transfixed.

She gets up and heads towards the water.   The boys
follow, running.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Saraghina and The Whores brandish tambourines. They
begin a slow, rhythmic and sensual dance that builds
into a wild and raucous tarantella.

We furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and
the memory of the boys romping on the beach with
Saraghina, across the sand and through the water.

The whores dance.

The number ends.


EXT. BEACH - DAY

Two PRIESTS are running down the beach, cassocks
flapping.

The boys run. Young Guido tries to run away from the
priests. They catch him and carry him away from the
beach.


INT. ST. SEBASTIAN CHAPEL - DAY

Off-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE.

The priests drag Young Guido through the school's
chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate
altar, into the Principal's office.


INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Guido's mother is there with the PRINCIPAL (again, she
appears the way he remembers her).

                       MAMMA
          I am ashamed of you, Guido.

                       YOUNG GUIDO
          But Mamma, what did I do.

                       PRINCIPAL
          Bring him here. That savage is the
          devil. God will punish you for your
          sins, now and forever.

The Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the
boy remorselessly. Mamma looks away. Young Guido cries
out as they punish him...


INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla
in the spasm of sex... He suddenly can't breathe...
Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... He
rolls over, recovers slowly. As always, immediately
wanting to leave after the sex.
                                   p. 47



                        CARLA
          What? What?

                       GUIDO
          I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

                       CARLA
          Guido, don't die on me! Can you
          imagine... poor Luigi! It would kill
          him.

                       GUIDO
                 (finding her ridiculous)
          If I die it would kill your husband?

Guido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly. Carla
kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back.

                       CARLA
          No, that's not what I meant, Guidino.
          No. Where are you going?

                       GUIDO
          I have to go to work. Carla, I can't
          breathe.

Guido stands up and picks up his shirt. He puts it on
whilst they argue.

                       CARLA
          Let me come with you.

                       GUIDO
          It's impossible.

                        CARLA
          Why?

                       GUIDO
          Because it's impossible. Please.

                       CARLA
          But why is it impossible? Look at your
          producer! He's married, he brings his
          girlfriend to work and nobody cares.
          Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why?
          Why won't you let me near you?

                       GUIDO
          For the very same reason you don't
          want me to die on top of you. It's
          not fair to your husband. It's not
          fair to my wife.
                                      p. 48



                       CARLA
          See, you're playing with me. You're
          twisting everything... Please let me
          come with you.

                       GUIDO
          No.

Guido heads towards the door, still dressing.

                       CARLA
          I'll be here waiting for you with my
          legs open.

Disgusted with himself, he leaves.


INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Glittering lights on the terrace. A view of the sea.
A pop band and a dance floor.   A slick Italian MALE
SINGER performs QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO. People dance.
The whole PRODUCTION TEAM is at a working dinner.
Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas,
struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia -

                        GUIDO
          Let's say there were ten sequences,
          each one set in a different period,
          but played by the same cast, a man and
          a woman, a woman and a man...
                 (pours himself a glass of
                  wine)
          Something light and hectic - like
          Mozart would do it, like Figaro.
                 (to Lilli)
          Like the circus...

                       DANTE
          Claudia is going to be amazing.

                       BENITO
          It sounds like a masterpiece.

                       FAUSTO
                 (hissing at Dante)
          Dante, you see, he hasn't written a
          word...

                       DANTE
                 (defending his director)
          The screenplay is first of all a map.
          That's a map.
                                      p. 49



                       GUIDO
          Let's try to dig for something else.
          Maybe a group of people digging, with
          shovels, in the desert.

                       LILLI
          Guido.

She nudges him. He looks across the restaurant to see
his wife at the entrance looking for him...

                       GUIDO
          Luisa!

He jumps up from the table and hurries towards the
dance floor, genuinely happy.

ON THE DANCE FLOOR:

 - as Guido is protective of Luisa... holding her back
from the dinner table.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          I can't believe you came.

                       LUISA
          The jungle drums said it was an
          emergency.

                       GUIDO
          The jungle drums exaggerated just a
          tiny bit.

                       LUISA
          Not entirely.
                 (with concern)
          You haven't been sleeping.

                       GUIDO
          I was dying, until just now.    Come.

He pulls her into the middle of the dance floor.    They
start to dance.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          And don't think I forgot your
          birthday. When you get home, the house
          will be full of flowers...

                       LUISA
          Am I already going home?

                       GUIDO
          I hope not. Happy Birthday, my
          darling.
                                   p. 50



They move together, enjoying each other.   She kisses
him.

They walk towards the table.

AT THE TABLE:

                       DANTE
                 (Seeing Luisa)
          Here she is. At last.   Magnificent.
          You know Donatella?

                       LUISA
          I do now.

She leans across to kiss Lilli.

He sits Luisa down, goes to grab a bottle of champagne.

                       LUISA (CONT'D)
                 (to Lilli)
          Thank you for calling.

                       LILLI
                 (confidentially)
          You're saving the movie. Give him a
          good idea, for God's sake.

Luisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are
kisses, etc. as Guido returns and pops open the bottle
of champagne.

                       GUIDO
          Let's drink a toast to Luisa's
          birthday.

                       LUISA
                 (negating it)
          It was Monday.

                       DANTE
          Happy Birthday!

                       LUISA
                 (not quite able to forgive
                  him)
          Thank you.

                       GUIDO
          Happy Birthday.

Just then, the Cardinal's Secretary appears.   Heads
towards the table.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Maestro.
                                      p. 51



                       GUIDO
                 (standing up to greet him,
                  then turning to Luisa)
          Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling,
          this is Don Mario. This is my wife,
          Luisa.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          A pleasure, Signora.

                       LUISA
          Sit down, won't you, Don Mario?

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Oh no.

                       LUISA
          Please.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          I was telling your husband how much I
          admire his movies. Publicly, you know
          the Church condemns them - we have to -
          but we all love them.
                 (To Guido)
          Last year we did our own version of
          your Il Vicolo at the Christmas
          Party.

                       LILLI
          That I would pay to see.

                       GUIDO
          Luisa was in that film.

                       LILLI
          She was the best thing in the movie.

                        GUIDO
          It's true.   It was your first part.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh
          my Lord!

                       LUISA
          I was.

Music begins.

                       CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
          You can't stop being somebody.

                       LUISA
          Can't you?
                                    p. 52



                        CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
           Well there's a good catholic wife for
           you, Guido, that's what they do -
           sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it
           must be a very exciting life for
           you...

Luisa looks to Guido.   Close up on Guido.


FANTASY:


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

The restaurant table as well as the production team are
transplanted onto Guido's unfinished set. They are
surrounded by camera equipment, standing lighting
units, etc. Luisa rises from her chair, distancing
herself from the scene. The other characters, with the
exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre
tableau.

Luisa contemplates her life with Guido.

                        LUISA
           MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES
           TO MAKE THEM HE LIVES A KIND OF DREAM
           IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS
           WHAT THEY SEEM-
           HE MAY BE ON TO SOME UNIQUE ROMANTIC
           THEME.
           SOME MEN RUN BANKS
           SOME RULE THE WORLD
           SOME EARN THEIR LIVING BAKING BREAD.
           MY HUSBAND.... HE GOES A LITTLE CRAZY
           MAKING MOVIES INSTEAD.
           MY HUSBAND SPINS FANTASIES,
           HE LIVES THEM, THEN GIVES THEM TO YOU
           ALL
           LIKE MICHELANGELO,
           HE PAINTS HIS PRIVATE DOME
           BUT CAN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT'S HIS WORK
           AND WHAT'S HIS HOME.
           SOME MEN SELL STOCKS
           SOME MEN PUNCH CLOCKS
           SOME LEAP WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD.
           MY HUSBAND, AS AUTHOR AND DIRECTOR,
           MAKES UP STORIES IN HIS HEAD.

As the number progresses, the world around Luisa
disappears into a black void, leaving only herself,
with Guido in the shadows. Luisa climbs the staircase.

                        LUISA (CONT'D)
           GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI:

          ACTRESS WITH DREAMS AND A LIFE OF HER
          OWN,
          THEN WE HAD NO END OF WORLDS TO
          DISCOVER,
          SINGING TOGETHER ALL NIGHT ON THE
          PHONE LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO...


MEMORY:


INT. INSERT STAGE - DAY

Luisa's screen test for Guido. A work print in
scratched black and white. The music continues.

                       CLAPPER LOADER (O.S.)
          Signorina Acari, per favore. Provino
          numero uno. Luisa Acari.

The clapper board. TITLE: IL VICOLO (The Alley)    Her
name: LUISA ACARI.

A small set. A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's
an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona.   Luisa enters,
younger, she's like Audrey Hepburn...

Luisa sits on the chair.

                       GUIDO (O.S.)
          Your name, it's Italian.

                       LUISA
          My father's Italian. My mother's
          French.

                       GUIDO (O.S.)
          What have you done before?

                       LUISA
                 (eyes twinkling)
          Oh, I've waited...

                       GUIDO (O.S.)
          Waited? For this?

                       LUISA
          Waited tables.
                 (they both laugh)
          And, of course, I studied theatre and
          mime in Paris. But, mostly waited
          tables.
                                   p. 54



Guido enters.   He's fascinated by her. She's taken
aback that he's in front of the camera and approaching
her. He walks straight up to her and unties her hair.
It's oddly intimate. He stands back to reappraise her.

                       GUIDO
          Thank you.

                       LUISA
          For what?

                       GUIDO
          Thank you. For what I'm looking at.
                 (walking away)
          Keep running.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Luisa is now at the top of the staircase. She looks at
Guido from a greater distance and descends the stairs.

                       LUISA
          LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO.
          HOW HE NEEDS ME SO,
          AND HE'LL BE THE LAST TO KNOW IT.
          MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES.
          TO MAKE THEM HE MAKES HIMSELF
          OBSESSED.
          HE WORKS FOR WEEKS ON END
          WITHOUT A BIT OF REST-
          NO OTHER WAY CAN HE ACHIEVE HIS LEVEL
          BEST.
          SOME MEN READ BOOKS,
          SOME SHINE THEIR SHOES,
          SOME RETIRE EARLY,
          SOME STAY UP TO DREAM AND MUSE.
          MY HUSBAND ONLY RARELY COMES TO BED -
          MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES INSTEAD.
          MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES...


INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

In reality, Luisa sees Carla enter the restaurant.
They look at each other. Carla tries to change
direction, or look as if she's come to the wrong place.

...Luisa gets up abruptly.

                       LUISA
          Excuse me, I suddenly feel very tired.

She hurries away. Guido senses something terrible is
happening. He gets up and goes after his wife.
                                    p. 55




EXT. STEPS, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Guido catches up to Luisa as she storms up the steps.

                       GUIDO
          Luisa!

                       LUISA
          I'm staggered by my own stupidity.    I
          could vomit.

                       GUIDO
          Luisa - will you please just tell me
          what happened?

                       LUISA
          You open your mouth and a lie comes
          out.

                       GUIDO
          What lie?

                       LUISA
          Why am I surprised? - it's like
          breathing to you.

She walks away up the steps. Guido can only guess at
what's happened. He heads back to the terrace
restaurant...


INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Guido comes back inside. Carla is seated at a table.
She sees him and calls for him.

                       CARLA
          Guido.

Raging, he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door.


INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Guido pulls Carla through the lobby. She's humiliated.

                       CARLA
                 (trying to explain)
          I was hungry. I'm tired of eating
          alone in that room.

                       GUIDO
          There are plenty of restaurants.
                                    p. 56



                       CARLA
          I wanted to see the hotel. I told you
          I came here with my parents when I was
          little. I didn't come to disturb you.

                       GUIDO
          Well you certainly managed to.

                       CARLA
          Why didn't you tell me Luisa was going
          to be here!

                       GUIDO
          I didn't know she was here.   She just
          turned up.

                       CARLA
          Well, she could have warned you.

                       GUIDO
          The only privilege my wife has these
          days is not having to warn me.

He walks over to the front desk, to the ubiquitous De
Rossi.

                       GUIDO O.S
          A taxi, please, for the Signora.

                        DE ROSSI O.S.
          Right away.

Guido goes back to the suddenly vulnerable Carla.

                       GUIDO
          Carla, you have to wait outside.

                       CARLA
          Will you wait with me?

                       GUIDO
          I'm in the middle of a working dinner
          with my colleagues.

                       CARLA
          So why do I have to wait outside?

                       GUIDO
                 (shamed)
          I'll find someone to escort you home.

He disappears. Carla walks towards the door, conscious
of De Rossi. She's humiliated. De Rossi comes out
from behind his desk, approaches her.
                                   p. 57



                       DE ROSSI
                 (carefully)
          Signora, would you rather wait inside?

                       CARLA
          I'm going to walk.   Please tell my
          friend I had to leave.

She walks away.


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Carla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling
along.


INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT

Guido enters. The two single beds. Luisa is apparently
asleep in hers. Guido sits on his bed. Glum.

                       GUIDO
          Apparently she's staying in some
          grotesque pensione next to the
          station.

Luisa doesn't move.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she
          would be staying in the hotel,
          wouldn't she? Think about it. I
          didn't even know you were coming.

                       LUISA
                 (without opening her eyes)
          Very plausible.

                       GUIDO
          Because it's true.

Luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed.

                       LUISA
          You told me it was finished.

                       GUIDO
          It is. Look, she was worried about
          me, she came to see if I was all right
          - which yes, is stupid but not, as far
          as I know, a crime, and hardly a
          mortal sin.

Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly.
                                      p. 58



                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
                 (smiles, insecure)
          What? What are you laughing about?

                       LUISA
          Nothing. If you could see yourself.
                 (raising herself up
                  further)
          I couldn't live with it - the
          absurdity of being you, the effort of
          having to hide and lie and cheat. It's
          exhausting, no wonder you've got no
          script, you're too busy inventing your
          own life.

                       GUIDO
          It's finished. It's finished.
                 (and he is exhausted)
          If it wasn't before, it is now.

                       LUISA
                 (lying back on her bed)
          Blah blah blah blah blah.

Luisa turns over, reaches to the bedside lamp and turns
it off. Guido gets up and hurries from the room.


INT. BAR, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Guido enters the bar, goes up to the bartender.

                       GUIDO
          Vodka.

A voice comes from behind him.

                       STEPHANIE (O.S.)
          I'll have one of those. Due.

Guido looks around, it's the Vogue Journalist from the
Press Conference. Stephanie grins at him, infectious,
full of flirt.

                       STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
          Hi, Guido Contini. Stephanie, from
          Vogue, remember me?

                       GUIDO
          Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina
          from Vogue.

                       STEPHANIE
          So, coincidence. You being here.    And
          me being here.
                                     p. 59



                       GUIDO
                 (taking his glasses off)
          Amazing. May I take a cigarette?

                       STEPHANIE
          That was quite a performance. At the
          Press Conference. The Vanishing Act.

Guido takes a cigarette. The drinks appear.    Guido
produces some money.

                       STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
          No, please, my treat.

                       GUIDO
                 (paying)
          Please.

                       STEPHANIE
          Grazie.

                       GUIDO
          Prego.

                       STEPHANIE
                 (eyeing Guido)
          I've seen all your movies.

                       GUIDO
                 (lights their cigarettes)
          Really?

                       STEPHANIE
          Like a million times. They're the only
          movies that tell the truth about the
          modern world.

                       GUIDO
          And what truth is that?

                       STEPHANIE
                 (thinks)
          Death of religion... Sexual
          revolution...

                       GUIDO
          I don't think religion is dead. And
          what exactly is the sexual revolution?

                       STEPHANIE
          That we can talk about later.

Stephanie crosses her legs. Guido looks down and sees
her grey patent leather boot moving in time to the
beat.

A RHYTHM BEGINS.
                                    p. 60



                        STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
           You have such style. I always think
           that. That's the other thing I love
           about your movies.

                          GUIDO
                    (appalled)
           Style.

FLASH: A SUDDEN HEAD TURN OF A MAN IN SHADES.

                        STEPHANIE
           Every frame is like a postcard.

                          GUIDO
                    (appalled)
           Okay.

                        STEPHANIE
           It's great: you care as much about the
           suit as the man wearing it.

FLASH: A SUDDEN IMAGE OF MEN IN STYLISH SUITS.

                        STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
           It's the Italian man in you: pays for
           your drinks, undresses you with his
           eyes...

FLASH: A SUDDEN IMAGE OF A WOMAN'S HIP THRUST.

                        GUIDO
           I hate that man.

                        STEPHANIE
           No! Style is the new content! It's
           what my readers love. They want to
           dress like Claudia Jenssen. They want
           to undress like Claudia Jenssen. They
           want to ride on a Vespa down the Via
           Veneto. They want to live in an
           Italian movie.


FANTASY:


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

The tiered levels of the unfinished set are covered
with go-go girls in silver miniskirts. At the center
of the stage, Italian male models in stylish suits and
Ray Bans strut down a fashion runway.

Stephanie makes her entrance on the catwalk.
                                   p. 61



                       STEPHANIE
          I LOVE THE BLACK AND WHITE!
          I LOVE THE PLAY OF LIGHT!
          THE WAY CONTINI PUTS HIS IMAGE THROUGH
          A PRISM.

Guido and Stephanie share a laugh as she steals a sip
from Guido's glass.

Stephanie leads the men in a series of tight, rhythmic
moves.

                       STEPHANIE

          MY LIFE IS REAL WITH CINEMA ITALIANO
          HE IS THE KING OF CINEMA ITALIANO!


INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Stephanie whispers into Guido's ear, as she drops her
room key into his pocket. He watches her hips swing as
she walks out. Guido plays with her room key, deciding
whether or not to follow.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

A long line of chic women replace the men on the
runway, joining Stephanie.

                       STEPHANIE
          THOSE SCENES I LOVE TO SEE
          FROM GUIDO'S "P" "O" "V"
          THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WITH HIS UNIQUE
          DIRECTOR'S VISION.
          HIS ANGLES - WIDE AND TIGHT -
          EACH MOMENT FEELS SO RIGHT...

          DECISION!

DRUM BREAK.   The number heats up.


INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Guido exits the elevator, weary and ripe with self-
disgust, and walks down the hallway to Stephanie's
door.

Guido pushes open the door and drops her key in a bowl.
He walks tentatively into the room and sits on her bed.
The dressing room door is deliberately ajar.

Guido catches a glimpse of Stephanie undressing in a
mirror.

Suddenly,   Guido is sharing the runway with Stephanie,
the go-go   dancers, and the male models, soaking up the
adoration   as his idol-worshipping audience cheers and
paparazzi   flash. It's a party. Champagne Popping.
Flowing.

Everyone is chanting Guido's name.     Guido and Stephanie
exit the runway, arm and arm...
                                       p. 64




INT. STEPHANIE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Guido feels consumed with self-loathing.

                       GUIDO
          No.

He gets up from the bed and bolts from the room...


INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT

...Guido enters his own suite. He sits down on Luisa's
bed, curls round her and kisses her neck. Determined
to commit to Luisa.

                       GUIDO
          I love you Luisa.

After a moment she turns to him, her own hand seeks
his.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Can we please try to be close again.

The PHONE RINGS, shockingly loud. He kisses Luisa,
then grabs the phone to silence it.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Pronto...


EXT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - NIGHT

Guido arrives at the Pensione.   The Matron is waiting
at the door. Distressed.


INT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - NIGHT

As they walk down the hall -

                       GUIDO
          Is the doctor still with her?

The Matron nods.

                       MATRON
          Yes, he's in there. He's waiting for
          you. This way.
                                      p. 65




INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido goes in with the Matron to find her DAUGHTER
pressing a cold compress onto Carla's head as she lies,
feverish in the bed. DOCTOR RONDI is packing up his
things.

                       CARLA
                 (distant)
          You came.

                       GUIDO
                 (taking her hand)
          I'm here.

Doctor Rondi is brisk.   He nods to Guido that they go
outside.

                       DOCTOR RONDI
          Signor Contini.

As Guido makes to leave -

                         CARLA
          Come back.

Guido reassures her with a gesture.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned.
Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks.

                       DOCTOR RONDI
          She took five or six pills, enough to
          make herself very sick. I understand
          she's your mistress.
                 (Guido can't answer)
          This is a sordid business. You movie
          people, I suppose you don't consider
          yourself bound by morality...

Guido doesn't fight. Rondi hands him the prescription,
picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido
leaning against the wall...


MEMORY:


EXT. BEACH - DAY

Young Guido, alone and dressed in his school uniform,
runs fast across the rough dunes.
                                     p. 66



                      MAMMA (O.S.)
          Guido? Dove corri? Where are you
          running to?


INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

... the door knob turns. Guido comes back into the
room, indicates to the Matron and her daughter that
they should leave.

                         GUIDO
          Thank you.    I'm going to stay with her
          now.

                       MATRON
          If you need us for anything, just
          call, okay? Francesca, andiamo.

                         GUIDO
          Grazie.

He sits on the side of the bed and puts his hand over
hers.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Carla, I should call your husband.

                       CARLA
          No, he'll take me home.

                       GUIDO
          What have you done to yourself?    I'm
          not worth dying for, Carla.

                       CARLA
          Don't be angry with me. Everything I
          do, I just want you to love me.

This comes out with enormous tenderness, as if she
suddenly understands herself.

                       CARLA (CONT'D)
          When you're not here with me, I'm
          still here. When you're in your life,
          making your movies, dancing with your
          wife - I'm still here.

Guido hears her.    Knows what she's saying is true.   She
looks at him.

                       GUIDO
          Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk
          about everything in the morning...

He stands and pulls a sheet up over her.
                                        p. 67



                        CARLA
                  (Clutching at him)
           Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

Guido lies down next to her, she turns to face him.

                         GUIDO
           Rest, rest.   Cara mia...

FANTASY:


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

                        MAMMA (O.S.)
           ...Caro,caro mio.

...Young Guido is scaling the unfinished set, as Mamma
circles him from below. Hundreds of candles fill the
darkness.

Mamma intercepts Young Guido as he jumps down from the
spiral staircase and she swings him into her arms. She
sings playfully.

                        MAMMA (CONT'D)
           GUARDA LA LUNA CHE BRILLA LASSU
           HOW THE MOON GLOWS
           AS IT SMILES OVER YOU
           WHEN YOU'RE DREAMING
           BLISSFULLY!
           DREAMING, FLYING FREE!


INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido attempts to comfort Carla.

                        CARLA
           My husband thinks I'm clever, that's
           the strange thing, because I'm not,
           well you know that, I spend too much
           time in my little brain thinking about
           you, about where you are, what you are
           doing, what you dream of.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Mamma guides Young Guido through an allée of candles.

                        MAMMA
           OH, DREAM OF YOUR YOUTH
           WHEN I'M STILL BY YOUR SIDE
           DREAM OF YOUR MANHOOD,
           PRAY I'M THERE TO GUIDE YOU
           AND WHEN YOU GROW OLD
                        (MORE)
                                    p. 68

                       MAMMA (CONT'D)
          HOW MY LOVE STILL WILL SHINE
          ALWAYS REMEMBER MY SON...
          YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
          MINE!
          YES, MINE!

She gently spins Young Guido, and - as he completes the
turn - he is replaced by Older Guido. Mamma now waltzes
with her adult son.

                       MAMMA (CONT'D)
          GUIDO
          SAI CHE TI VOGLIO BENE,
          FIGLIOLO MIO,
          GUIDO
          DO YOU THINK THAT SO MANY
          WILL LOVE YOU
          AS I DO?

Mamma caresses Guido's face.   Guido pulls away.

Older Guido watches, as Mamma takes Young Guido up the
grand staircase.

                       MAMMA (CONT'D)
          GUARDA LA LUNA,
          SHE HANGS IN THE SKY
          BEAMING HER BLESSING
          TO MAKE YOU AND I KNOW THAT
          THIS ONE GOODNIGHT KISS
          WILL KEEP ALL YOUR LIFE
          PERFECT LIKE THIS.

Mamma sits on the steps with Young Guido.     He rests his
head in her lap.

Older Guido walks past them up the staircase.

                       GUIDO
          Hold on to me, Mamma.   Don't let me
          wake from this.

He disappears into darkness.


INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

Guido wakes. It's morning.

Carla looks very fragile as the first rays of sun touch
the room. Him, too. He rubs his face, hears voices.
He gets up, goes out to investigate.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

Carla's husband, LUIGI, is talking with Matron on the
landing.
                                   p. 69


Guido straightens himself up, approaches, as Matron
retreats to leave them alone. LUIGI is a nice,
dignified man. He's very anxious. He and Guido can't
really look at each other.

                         MATRON
          Excuse me.

She leaves.

                         LUIGI
          Is she okay?

                         GUIDO
          Yes.

                       LUIGI
          I'd like to take her home.

                       GUIDO
          Of course. I'm sorry.
                 (hapless)
          She loves you, you know that, don't
          you.

                       LUIGI
          She's my wife.

He walks into the room. Guido stands outside for a
second, then turns to go.


INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

The door is open as Guido enters. He's confused,
worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees
a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a
closet.

                         GUIDO
          Darling?

Dante appears, stuffing Guido's things into a suitcase.

                       DANTE
          We're going back to Rome.

                       GUIDO
                 (anxious)
          Where's Luisa?

                       DANTE
          Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with
          you.
                 (different tone)
          And quite frankly, so have I. You
          drag a whole crew up here and then you
          just disappear.
                       (MORE)
                                    p. 70

                       DANTE (CONT'D)
          I can't protect you anymore. And
          Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start
          today. Remember?

                          GUIDO
                 (sits)
          I can't.

                       DANTE
          You can't. You must. Don't sit down.

                          GUIDO
          I need help.

                       DANTE
                 (still packing)
          You've had help. You've seen the
          doctors, you've seen the priests,
          you've taken the cure.

                       GUIDO
          I'm not cured.

                       DANTE
                 (decisive, no arguments)
          That's enough! The movie calls, your
          star has landed. Fausto - take his
          things please.

Dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing
Fausto. A Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall.

                      DANTE (CONT'D)
                (impatient,
                at the door)
          Guido! Andiamo!


EXT. GATES OF CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON

Guido's Roadster approaches the gates. There are
PAPARAZZI gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the
beginning of filming. They drive through, solemn faced,
ignoring the press.

                       GUIDO (O.S.)
          I need more time.

                       DANTE (O.S.)
          Forget the script. Claudia's here now.
          She'll inspire you to do what you do
          best, write with your camera.
                                     p. 71




EXT. CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON

The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic,
people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work,
everybody and everything needing Guido's attention.

Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the
pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a
movie that doesn't exist.

Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just
arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to
Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are
immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests
for Guido...

                       PIERPAOLO
          Maestro, the screen tests are back
          from the lab. Will you watch them now?

                       DANTE
          Tonight.   We'll watch everything
          tonight and make some decisions.

                       PIERPAOLO
          Design meeting? Production meeting?

                        DANTE
          Tonight.

                        PIERPAOLO
          Tonight.

Dante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins
them.

                       LILLI
          Claudia says where are you? She's in
          fine form. Feisty.

                        GUIDO
                  (knows what that means)
          Okay.

                       LILLI
          She asked if she could read my script
          as she didn't have one. I said I
          didn't quite have mine.

Lilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a
rack of costumes.
                                    p. 72




INT. INSERT STAGE, CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON

A couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some
lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is
preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a
slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS.

The gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew,
then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio
telephone behind the flats. He dials.

Guido waits. Luisa picks up the phone.

                       LUISA
          Pronto.

                       GUIDO
          Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up.
                 (she doesn't respond)
          I want you to be with me in the
          screening room tonight. I want to talk
          to you about the casting, about the
          script. Everything...


INT. INSERT STAGE/CONTINI HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

INTERCUT, LUISA at home, listening, inscrutable.

                       GUIDO
          Otherwise I won't be able to start, I
          won't know what I'm thinking...

Luisa listens. Pierpaolo appears again, always the
same, needs him to start.

                       PIERPAOLO
          Maestro.

Guido nods, waves him away.

                       GUIDO
          Are you there? Luisa?

                       LUISA
          Go on.

                       GUIDO
          I'm not asking you to let me come
          home, I just want you to come to the
          screen test tonight. Not for me, but
          for the movie. You always have, you
          always do.

Luisa puts down the phone.
                                     p. 73



Guido is in a mess.


INT. INSERT STAGE - EARLY EVENING

Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly
there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and
some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only,
followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around
her. As the others walk towards a holding area with
costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman,
who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light,
her home, and stands there waiting for Guido.

She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a
Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches
Claudia.

Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.

                       PIERPAOLO
          Silence please. Se gira. And we are
          rolling.

Guido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test.

                       GUIDO
          Could you turn to the right please,
          Claudia.

                       CLAUDIA
          Yes, I can turn to my right.

                       GUIDO
          And can you turn to the left.

                       CLAUDIA
          Yes, I can turn to my left.

                       GUIDO
          Now just one slow turn for us.

                       CLAUDIA
                 (she turns around)
          Okay, one slow turn.

                        GUIDO
          Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut.

                       PIERPAOLO
          We've got it. Next costume please.

Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately
surround her, loosening her hair.

Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised.    She's a
star, that's the long and short of it.
                                   p. 74


And she's warming up for a fight with her director.
Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous.

                       CLAUDIA
          Has anybody got a script? Script
          missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one
          script, title Italia. Can't make a
          film without it...

Lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on
Claudia, adjusts her hair.

                       CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
          So interesting to do hair and makeup
          for a part when you don't know what
          the part is.

Guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness.

                       CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
                 (shrugs off the coat)
          No! I'm going back to my hotel now.

                       PIERPAOLO
                 (anxious)
          But please, just a couple more
          costumes, Claudia.

                       CLAUDIA
                 (to Guido)
          I'm going back to my hotel now, my
          darling, and when I there is a script,
          I'll read it and then we'll take it
          from there.
                 (calls over to Lilli)
          I love the costumes, Lilli. They are
          beautiful.
                 (back to the guys,
                  sweetly)
          Ciao Bello.

                         GUIDO
          That's fair.

                         DANTE
          Claudia!

                       GUIDO
                 (to Dante)
          That's fair.

                         DANTE
          Fair?

                       GUIDO
          I'll be back.
                                    p. 75



Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat
from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape.

                       DANTE
          (calling to Guido)
          You've got dailies, Guido.

                       GUIDO
          I'll be right back.

                       DANTE
          (shouting)
          You've got meetings.


EXT. CINECITTA - NIGHT

Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing
open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car,
flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a
picture of the Star driving away with her Director.
Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from
Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed
by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas
and little cars.


INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse
following.   Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her
in the car, she's such a class act. He's always
inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.

                       GUIDO
          You look ravishing.

                       CLAUDIA
          You're not seeing me, you're seeing
          Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere
          hidden underneath.

Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the
traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up,
they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake
a car, they speed after him.


EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT

Guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the
Trastevere, just south of the Vatican. They watch the
photographers hurtle past in search of them.

They sit for a second.
                                   p. 76



                       GUIDO
          It's good to see you.

                       CLAUDIA
          I'm assuming that's code for there's
          no script.

Guido is exasperated.

                       GUIDO
          Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed
          with the script?

Claudia listens. She's always seduced by the way he
speaks, his passion. They fall in love with each other
in every movie, that's the way of it. Guido lights a
cigarette.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          Talk to the people who love you in our
          films, they're not interested in my
          script! They're interested in the way
          you turn your head, the way the camera
          looks past you to the moon... the way
          you smile a little as you cry, the way
          you really do blush for the camera -
          how?! -
                 (enough examples, sighs)
          who even knows, but whatever else it
          is, it's not my script.

Guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore.

They get out of the car and begin to walk away.    It's

          So Lilli says I'm playing a million
          different parts -

                       GUIDO
          Not a million - you're the muses, the
          incredible women who made Italy what
          it is today, a country run by men -
          who are themselves run by women,
          whether they know it or not.

                       CLAUDIA
                 (teasing him)
          So I'm the women behind the great men?

                       GUIDO
                 (trying hard to tell the
                  truth)
          The great women...

                        GUIDO (CONT'D)
           In a way - yes - you have this man in
           the story and he's, he wants to take
           hold of everything, to devour
           everything, he can't let anything go,
           or, he doesn't want to, and he changes
           direction every day, because he's
           lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to
           death...

                        CLAUDIA
                  (deflating)
           And these muses - they fall in love
           with the man?

                         GUIDO
           Exactly!   They fall in love with him.

                        CLAUDIA
                  (decisive)
           I'd rather be the man.

                        GUIDO
           What?

                        CLAUDIA
           I'd rather be the man.

She grabs his hat, puts it on her head.     Saunters down
the road. He follows.

          No.

                       CLAUDIA
          It's not a real person, Guido.
                 (pointed)

          know how to love.

EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Claudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient
fountain in the centre of the square. The Piazza is
empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances
have been blocked off. Claudia steps up onto the
fountain.
                                     p. 79



                       GUIDO
          There was a time once, we were on
          location, some terrible hotel - and
          you were in the room directly above me
          and I could hear you walking about...

Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          ...and, all through the night, I
          wanted to rush up the stairs and
          hammer on your door until you opened.

                       CLAUDIA
          And why didn't you?

          HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU,
          ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL.
          IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,
          YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE.


EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves
closer to Guido. The music continues.

                       CLAUDIA
          Maybe you should have knocked, maybe
          you should have knocked me right off
          the pedestal. I can't do this
          anymore.

She takes off her wig and diamond earrings.

                        CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
          This is me.   And you have a wife who
          loves you.

She hands him the wig and the earrings.    She kisses
him.

                       CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
          I'll miss you. Wrong girl.

The music ends.   Claudia turns and walks away.
                                     p. 80




INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting
down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the
screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup
test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically.

Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up.

                       DANTE
                 (to Lilli)
          Great work, Lilli... Wonderful
          costume...

                       LILLI
          Thank you.

                       DANTE
          ...and the hair, makeup, fantastic.

Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he
sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not
Luisa.

                       BENITO
          She has a beautiful profile.

                       DANTE
          Two great profiles.

                       FAUSTO
          She's a goddess.

                       DANTE
          And the back isn't too bad.

                       FAUSTO
          She came directly from Venus.
          Beautiful.

                      DANTE
          Fantastic. Guido?     Really nice.
          Who's next?

                       BENITO
          Actresses.

                        DANTE
          Okay.   Let's see the actresses.

The reel finishes. The lights come up, to excited
chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she
shrugs sympathetically.

The room goes dark, the next reel begins.      Guido turns
back to look at the screen.
                                     p. 81



During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out,
as the women appear.

They come on, one after the other, say their names.
Guido gives them things to do.   Pick up the phone and
argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him
want you.   Walk towards the camera as if you were
frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very
angry on the phone:

                       BENITO
          If we like her, we have to call her
          agent right away. Everybody wants her
          right now.

                       DANTE
          Well they can keep her.

                       BENITO
          She's a very funny actress.

                       DANTE
          She's peculiar. You don't like her
          Guido?

Next actress: ILARIA. Someone comes in the door.
Guido turns and sees it's Luisa, sitting next to Lilli.
She's come. He turns back to the screen.

Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Very
nervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her.     She
tries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural.

Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. She
looks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it like
sunshine. He turns back to the screen.

                        DANTE (CONT'D)
          She's nice.

                       FAUSTO
          She's very natural.

                       DANTE
          Even better. She's a bit nervous
          here. What do you say, Guido?
          Donatella's nice?

Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps looking
out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions
from Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins her
improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in
front of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes the
chignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and
innocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. But
what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes,
goes like a dagger to Luisa.
                                      p. 82



                       DANTE (CONT'D)
          Who's this? I thought we were looking
          for a blonde.

                       FAUSTO
          She's too tall.

                       DANTE
          Very tall.

                       BENITO
          She's very beautiful.

                       DANTE
          It's not the point.     Guido wants the
          blonde.

                       FAUSTO
          She's not bad, but -

                       DANTE
          Shh.

                       FAUSTO
          She's beautiful.

                       DANTE
          She's too beautiful.      For my tastes.

As the reel finishes... and the lights come up.

                       DANTE (CONT'D)
          I don't know what Guido thinks. I
          think we are happy with Donatella.
          Donatella's better, isn't she?

                       GUIDO
          Sure.

                       DANTE
                 (delighted, jumps up)
          Great. Anyway, fantastic day, but we
          have to go home. We have a very, very
          busy day tomorrow. Thank you very much
          everybody. Thank you. Okay, well
          done.

The screening room empties, a lot of mutual
congratulations on good work, especially to Lilli, and
a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for Luisa.
Lilli kisses her, leaves. Just the two of them now,
husband and wife, several rows apart in the empty
screening room.

                       GUIDO
          It meant so much to us all.    That you
          came.

                        GUIDO (CONT'D)
                  (nothing from Luisa)
           What did you think? Did you like
           anybody or -?
                  (nothing)
           Luisa?

FANTASY:


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

THE BEAT OF A STRIPPER'S DRUM.

A gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain,
beckoning. The curtain opens, revealing the silhouette
of a figure bathed in red light.

Guido sits in an audience of raucous men who have
filled all the seats around him. They start to whistle
as if they were at some sleazy club. Guido squirms,
trapped.

The figure steps forward. It's Luisa, tricked out like
a seedy nightclub stripper.

                        LUISA
           YOU WANT MY LOVE?
           TAKE IT ALL
           YOU WANT TO WATCH IT ALL COME OFF?
           TAKE IT ALL
           COME ON NOW
           SHOW ME HOW
           YOU TAKE IT ALL...


INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

                        LUISA
           Thank you.

                        GUIDO
                  (encouraged)
           What for?

                        LUISA
           Thank you for reminding me I'm not
           special. You don't even see what you
           do, do you? Even the moments I think
           are ours, it's just you working to get
           what you want.

                       LUISA
          YOU WANT MY GLOVE?
          ARE YOU ENTHRALLED?
          YOU WANT TO SEE IT SLIP AWAY
          AND WATCH IT FALL?
          OH WE KNOW
          IT'S YOUR SHOW
          SO TAKE IT ALL


INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

                       GUIDO
                 (dawning on him)
          What are you talking about?

He stands up, leans on the chair back.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          The screen test? You have to
          understand, it's nothing, this is what
          I do, I direct. That's my job.

Guido stands up straight.

                       LUISA
          And this is our life. You think to
          create is to forgive yourself in
          public. Fine. But don't think I can
          forgive you in private, because I
          can't ever.


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

As the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes
her body and her contempt for Guido. Guido watches,
humiliated.

                        LUISA
          SO GO AHEAD
          TAKE IT ALL

          YOU WANT MY SOUL?
          TAKE IT ALL!

          IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.
          IF I'M TO LIVE.
          BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE,
          THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE...

Instrumental.

Luisa charges into the audience: she is mauled and
assaulted by the men.
                                     p. 85



                       LUISA (CONT'D)
          I WATCH YOU RISE!
          I WATCH YOU FALL!
          WHILE I AM STANDING
          WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE WALL
          NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
          TO FINALLY LEARN

          YOU HAD THE WORLD
          YOU HAD YOUR FLING
          YOU WANTED MORE THAN EVERYTHING
          YOU GOT YOUR WISH
          YOU GOT YOUR PRIZE
          NOW TAKE IT RIGHT BETWEEN YOUR THIGHS
          YOU GRABBED FOR EVERYTHING MY FRIEND
          BUT DON'T YOU SEE
          THAT IN THE END
          THERE WILL BE
          NOTHING!


INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

                       LUISA
          You're just an appetite, and if you
          stopped being greedy you'd die. You
          take everything, and I'm empty.

Luisa gets up from her chair, heads to the exit door.

                       LUISA (CONT'D)
          You know, I'm glad I came. I can see
          now... it's hopeless...

Luisa leaves.   Guido is left alone.

The room goes dark as the screen tests, on a loop,
start up again.

Guido walks into the flickering light of the
projector...

                       GUIDO
          What have I done? What have I done,
          Luisa?


INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Guido stands and walks towards the image on the screen.
He violently rips the screen to the ground.

          IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP OR UNDERSTAND
          HOW CAN I GO ON TO WATCH THE WHOLE OF
          MY EXISTENCE
          END UP BEING NOTHING THAT I PLANNED
          HAVE I LOST MYSELF AND ALL I WISHED
          FOR
          HAS MY LIFE BECOME A MINDLESS GAME
          GUIDO, I CAN'T STAND THE NAME OF GUIDO
          GUIDO, FOR GODSAKE,
          WHO IS THIS GUIDO?
          GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT
          GUIDO...

Guido collapses to his knees.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
                 (honest)
          I destroyed everything, Mamma...

Suddenly, his mother appears.

                       GUIDO (CONT'D)
          ...I destroyed everything, I just...
          you make one wrong turn and then
          because of that, after it all the
          turns are wrong. And you are so far
          from where you wanted to be...and
          you're lost and then you're lost.
                                       p. 87



                       MAMMA
          No one can help you find your way.
                 (a beat)
          It's up to you, Guido. Up to you.
          Nobody else.

In Guido's face, a soulful recognition that what she's
said is true.


INT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY

A HUGE CRASH...

...A large piece of Guido's set comes crashing down.

Dante and Guido walk through the empty soundstage,
leaving behind the set which is being dismantled by a
group of construction workers.

                       GUIDO (O.S.)
          Old friends, I have to come clean with
          you.


INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY

REALITY. Guido faces his production team.      This is
hard for him.

                       GUIDO
          There is no movie. I can't pretend
          anymore. We have to stop.
                 (nothing more to say)
          I'm sorry.

There is silence in the room.


EXT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY

The metal soundstage door opens as Guido and Dante walk
through and into the sunlight. Guido is defeated. He
stops at his car and turns to Dante. Guido gets in his
car. Guido drives away. Dante watches him go.


EXT. BEACH - ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON

A cold wind blows.   A lonely figure (GUIDO) walks along
a deserted beach.

SUPERTITLE:   Anguillara, Italy, 2 years later
                                    p. 88




EXT. BEACH CAFE, ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON

It's the end of the season. Only a few customers left
in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day,
pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables.

Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt.
Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves
crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of
him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a
theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this
moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper,
folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant.

He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we
catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes -


EXT. ROME, THEATER - NIGHT

Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street
from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play,
DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI.

Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all
of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie.

Guido watches from a distance.

Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross
and head down the street.


EXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAY

Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront.   People pass
by occasionally. They talk -

                       LILLI
          I'm glad she's acting again. I made
          her costumes for the play. She's
          funny.

                       GUIDO
          She seemed so happy. I didn't want to
          interfere... Is she with anybody?

                       LILLI
          Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her
          mother. I don't know. I expect so.
          Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me
          you're going to let me cut your hair
          and get rid of that awful beard.
                                      p. 89



                        GUIDO
           I like to get about without everybody
           pointing at me.

                        LILLI
           And where are you getting about?

                        GUIDO
           Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be
           able to walk.

                        LILLI
           Are you seeing anybody?

                        GUIDO
           No, no. Nobody.

                        LILLI
                  (teasing)
           Well, it sounds exciting. Walking
           around and not seeing anyone, growing
           a beard.   I might come up here and
           join you.

                        GUIDO
           Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is -

                        LILLI
           - I know.

                        GUIDO
           I just miss her. I should have IDIOT
           tattooed on my forehead.

                        LILLI
           Luisa certainly thinks so.

                        GUIDO
                  (grasping at this)
           Does she? Did she really say that?

                        LILLI
           Stop! I'm not going to act as a
           postman between you both. Come back
           to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work.

He sits.   Lilli joins him.

                        GUIDO
           No. Never. I've spent this time
           trying to learn something, Lilli, to
           not be the person who forgets about
           everybody else, the person who never
           grew up.
                                      p. 90



                       LILLI
          You're such a dope, aren't you?
          Making movies wasn't your problem. You
          were your problem.   Don't stop being
          a child. You'll never make another
          movie! Nobody wants that...
          especially Luisa.

She indicates the people who pass.

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          Guido - there probably isn't a single
          person passing by who hasn't been
          touched in some way by one of your
          movies. That's your gift. That's what
          you've been given. Use it. Just use it
          with some grace. For Chrissake.

                       GUIDO
                 (doubtful)
          The only movie I could make now would
          be... I don't know... would be about a
          man trying to win back his wife.

                       LILLI
          Sounds perfect.
                 (after a beat)
          The costumes might not be so bad too.

FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a
female eye applying false eyelashes.

FLASH: A man of the collar applies pancake makeup,
while a cigarette dangles from his lips.

Young Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear.

                       YOUNG GUIDO
          We're ready to begin!


INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS

A surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores,
models, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to
begin.

The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and
builds throughout.

People run past with props, lights, etc.    Showgirls are
hurrying. A beautiful confusion.
                                      p. 91




EXT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY

Guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He
stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence.
Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is
greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge
his support. Pierpaolo is tender.

                       GUIDO
          I can't remember how you do this.

                       PIERPAOLO
          You'll remember.


INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS

The camera moves through the backstage mayhem.

Mamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is
sharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping
with her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her
husband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk.
Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.


INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY

Guido is in his element again, locked in passionate
discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,
an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;
a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.
The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something
smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a
woman.

                       GUIDO
          I don't want to say too much. The
          first way that we kill our film is by
          talking about it. But this scene is
          about reconciliation. And within the
          scene I would like you to try and find
          your way to begin that journey back
          towards each other.


INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS

Young Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.

                       YOUNG GUIDO
          Presto! Presto! Take your places!
          Andiamo! Andiamo!

The dressing rooms begin to empty.
                                    p. 92




INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY

From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido
watches Older Guido at work.

                       GUIDO
                 (Continuing to speak to
                  his actors)
          Maybe it's the most important building
          block that we have to begin again...
          We start from the beginning each time
          and I feel today as if I'm starting
          from the beginning. We'll just keep
          asking each other questions, and don't
          look to me for the answers, okay?

On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and
ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a
sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange
themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom
behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.

But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task
that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down
his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his
glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set
in front of him.

                       PIERPAOLO
          Maestro, should I call final checks?

                       GUIDO
          Yes.

                       PIERPAOLO
          Makeup, please! Final checks!

A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind
Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every
inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A
part of him now and forever.

Guido sits on the crane.

The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure
slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps
through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet
distance, she watches her husband return to his gift.

Pierpaolo calls for silence.

                       PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)
          Alora. Silencio per favore. Silence
          please.
                 (to camera)
          Gyriamo. E alora motore!
                                    p. 93



CLOSE UP ON THE CLAPBOARD.   WORKING TITLE: NINE.   DIR:
G. CONTINI.

As the clapboard strikes.

                       CLAPPER LOADER
          Slate.

At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the
maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the
crane with Guido as it begins to rise. Luisa watches.
As the last note plays, the crane soars higher,
carrying Guido up and up.

                       GUIDO
          ACTION.

CUT TO BLACK.

                                           1939

                

               FADE IN ON:

               AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS IN THE MONTH OF APRIL

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE LUXURIOUS LOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

               CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the desk. In the background 
               is a revolving door leading to the street. Through the 
               revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously 
               one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. It is Comrade 
               Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade. Despite 
               the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical 
               Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a 
               fur cap, and heavy boots.

               Buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed 
               by its magnificence. The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's 
               strange appearance, approaches him.

                                     MANAGER
                              (politely)
                         Is there anything I can do for you, 
                         monsieur?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         No, no.

               He exits toward the street. The Manager returns to his 
               customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly 
               dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. 
               It is Comrade Iranoff.

               The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.

                                     MANAGER
                         Yes, monsieur?

                                     IRANOFF
                         Just looking around.

               Iranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when 
               suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same 
               fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade 
               Kopalski.

               Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it 
               turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager 
               is by now dumfounded.

               STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

               A taxi stands at the curb. Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting 
               beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase. Kopalski, returning 
               from the hotel, joins the group.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Comrades, why should we lie to each 
                         other? It's wonderful.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Let's be honest. Have we anything 
                         like it in Russia?

                                     ALL THREE
                              (agreeing with him)
                         No, no, no.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Can you imagine what the beds would 
                         be in a hotel like that?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         They tell me when you ring once the 
                         valet comes in; when you ring twice 
                         you get the waiter; and do you know 
                         what happens when you ring three 
                         times? A maid comes in -- a French 
                         maid.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (with a gleam in his 
                              eye)
                         Comrades, if we ring nine times... 
                         let's go in.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (stopping him)
                         Just a minute -- just a minute -- I 
                         have nothing against the idea but I 
                         still say let's go back to the Hotel 
                         Terminus. Moscow made our reservations 
                         there, we are on an official mission, 
                         and we have no right to change the 
                         orders of our superior.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Where is your courage, Comrade 
                         Buljanoff?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Are you the Buljanoff who fought on 
                         the barricades? And now you are afraid 
                         to take a room with a bath?

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (stepping back into 
                              the taxi)
                         I don't want to go to Siberia.

               Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly.

                                     IRANOFF
                         I don't want to go to the Hotel 
                         Terminus.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         If Lenin were alive he would say, 
                         "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in 
                         your life you're in Paris. Don't be 
                         a fool. Go in there and ring three 
                         times."

                                     IRANOFF
                         He wouldn't say that. What he would 
                         say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford 
                         to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't 
                         the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean 
                         anything to you? Do you want to live 
                         in a hotel where you press for the 
                         hot water and cold water comes and 
                         when you press for the cold water 
                         nothing comes out at all? Phooey, 
                         Buljanoff!"

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (weakening)
                         I still say our place is with the 
                         common people, but who am I to 
                         contradict Lenin? Let's go in.

               All three start to leave the taxi, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE -- AT THE DESK

               Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are approaching the Manager, 
               their only suitcase carried by two of them.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Are you the manager?

                                     MANAGER
                              (eyeing the three 
                              suspiciously)
                         Yes.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Pardon me for introducing Comrade 
                         Iranoff, member of the Russian Board 
                         of Trade.

                                     MANAGER
                              (bowing with strained 
                              politeness)
                         Monsieur.

                                     IRANOFF
                         This is Comrade Kopalski.

                                     MANAGER
                         Monsieur.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         I am Comrade Buljanoff.

                                     MANAGER
                         Monsieur.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         May I ask how much your rooms are?

                                     MANAGER
                              (trying to get rid of 
                              them)
                         Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates 
                         are rather high.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Why should you be afraid?

               The other two nod their agreement. The Manager has noted the 
               single suitcase.

                                     MANAGER
                              (haughtily)
                         I might be able to accommodate you. 
                         Is there some more luggage?

                                     IRANOFF
                         Oh, yes, but have you a safe here 
                         big enough to hold this?

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm afraid we have no boxes of that 
                         size in our vault, but there is one 
                         suite with a private safe...

                                     IRANOFF
                         That's even better.

                                     MANAGER
                         But, gentlemen, I am afraid...

                                     BULJANOFF
                         He's always afraid.

               The other two exchange a look of agreement again.

                                     MANAGER
                              (a little annoyed)
                         I just wanted to explain. The 
                         apartment may suit your convenience 
                         but I doubt that it will fit your 
                         convictions. It's the Royal Suite.

               The mention of the Royal Suite startles the three.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Royal Suite!
                              (To the manager)
                         Just a minute.

               The Three Russians take a step away from the manager and go 
               into a huddle.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (in a low voice)
                         Now Comrades, I warn you... if it 
                         gets out in Moscow that we stay in 
                         the Royal Suite we will get into 
                         terrible trouble.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (defending his right 
                              to a good time)
                         We'll just say we had to take it on 
                         account of the safe. That's a perfect 
                         excuse. There was no other safe big 
                         enough.

               The other two welcome the suggestion with relish.

                                     BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
                         That's right. Good, very good.

               Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Of course, we could take out the 
                         pieces and distribute them in three 
                         or four boxes in the vault and take 
                         a small room. That's an idea, isn't 
                         it?

               For a moment all three see their bright plans crumble. Then 
               Iranoff comes to the rescue.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Yes, it's an idea, but who says we 
                         have to have an idea?

               Buljanoff and Kopalski see the logic of this and their faces 
               light up.

                                     BOTH
                         That's right... that's right.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (turning to the Manager)
                         Give us the Royal Suite.

               The Manager leads the three toward the elevator. The CAMERA 
               FOLLOWS THEM and NARROWS DOWN to the suitcase carried by two 
               of the Russians.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               DARK INTERIOR OF SAFE -- ROYAL SUITE

               We hear from the outside the turning of a key, the opening 
               of a door, then the turning of the dial, and then we see the 
               safe door open. Through the open door we now see the Royal 
               Suite. The Three Russians are standing in front of the safe. 
               One of them puts the suitcase into it.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROYAL SUITE OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

               Shooting from the interior of the room toward the safe. The 
               Three Russians are standing around it. As Buljanoff and 
               Iranoff close the safe door, Kopalski walks out of the shot. 
               The CAMERA STAYS for a few seconds on Buljanoff and Iranoff, 
               then PANS OVER to the center of the room, where a waiter is 
               setting a breakfast table. He is the former Count Rakonin, a 
               Russian exile employed by the Hotel Clarence. Rakonin is 
               looking with great interest toward the safe, and as he does 
               so we hear Kopalski's voice talking into the telephone.

                                     KOPALSKI'S VOICE
                         Will you connect me with Mercier... 
                         yes, the jeweler...

               Rakonin pricks up his ears and looks toward the telephone.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         I want to speak with Monsieur Mercier 
                         personally... Hello, Monsieur Mercier? 
                         This is Kopalski of the Russian Board 
                         of Trade. We arrived this morning... 
                         Thank you.

               CLOSE SHOT -- RAKONIN

               As he sets the breakfast table, his interest in the telephone 
               conversation increases.

                                     KOPALSKI'S VOICE
                         Yes, everything is here. The necklace 
                         too. All fourteen pieces... What? 
                         No, Monsieur Mercier, the court jewels 
                         of the Duchess Swana consisted of 
                         fourteen pieces. Why don't you check 
                         on that? Naturally, we have all the 
                         necessary credentials.

               As the voice continues, we

               SERVICE STAIRCASE -- HOTEL CLARENCE

               Rakonin hurries down the stairs, buttoning his overcoat around 
               him. He exits through a door to the street.

               INSERT the House Number "8"

               above the doorway of a Parisian apartment house. Camera pulls 
               back to medium shot of the whole entrance. Into it is striding 
               a typical Parisian playboy. He is Count Leon d'Algout.

               ENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

               The door is being opened by Swana's maid. Leon enters like a 
               man thoroughly at home.

                                     MAID
                         Good morning, Count.

                                     LEON
                         Good morning.

                                     MAID
                         Her Highness is still dressing.

                              Swana's door)
                         That's all right.

               LONG SHOT -- SWANA'S ROOM

               Swana sits at her dressing table in a negligee. Leon enters 
               with the easy air of an old friend. He kisses her lightly.

                                     SWANA
                         Hello, Leon!

                                     LEON
                         Good morning, Swana.

               During Swana's long speech he sits down, not paying much 
               attention to her patter, lights a cigarette, and glances 
               through a magazine.

                                     SWANA
                         It's really a wretched morning... 
                         wretched. I can't get myself right. 
                         I wanted to look mellow and I look 
                         brittle. My face doesn't compose 
                         well... all highlights... how can I 
                         dim myself down, Leon? Suggest 
                         something. I am so bored with this 
                         face. I wish I had someone else's 
                         face. Whose face would you have if 
                         you had your choice? Oh, well, I 
                         guess one gets the face one deserves.

                                     LEON
                         Your conversation has one marvelous 
                         advantage, Swana. However many 
                         questions you ask you never expect 
                         an answer.

                         Don't you find that restful?... Why 
                         didn't you come last night?

                                     LEON
                         Darling, I was busy looking out for 
                         your interests.

                         We can forget horse racing, roulette, 
                         the stock market... our worries are 
                         over! You remember that platinum 
                         watch with the diamond numbers? You 
                         will be in a position to give it to 
                         me.

                                     SWANA
                              (with humor)
                         Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
                              (She kisses him)

                                     LEON
                         We can be rich if you say the word. 
                         I had dinner with the Guizots last 
                         night.

                                     SWANA
                              (contemptuously)
                         Those newspaper people?

                                     LEON
                         You'd be surprised how many nice 
                         people dine with the Guizots.

                                     SWANA
                         What a gruesome proof of the power 
                         of the press!

                                     LEON
                         Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur 
                         Guizot the idea of publishing your 
                         memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. 
                         "The Life and Loves of the Grand 
                         Duchess Swana of Russia"!

                                     SWANA
                              (protestingly)
                         Oh, Leon!

                                     LEON
                         Sweetheart, we won't have to bother 
                         about our future if you are willing 
                         to raffle off your past!

                                     SWANA
                         Was it for this that I refused to 
                         endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I 
                         could have made a little fortune by 
                         saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner 
                         was the only vacuum cleaner ever 
                         used by the Romanoffs... and now you 
                         want them to smear my life's secrets 
                         over the front page of a tabloid?

                                     LEON
                         I understand how you feel, but there 
                         is a limit to everything, particularly 
                         pride and dignity. They are willing 
                         to pay any price! They have a 
                         circulation of two million!

                                     SWANA
                         Imagine two million clerks and shop 
                         girls peeking into my life for a 
                         sou! Think of my lovely life being 
                         wrapped around cheese and blood 
                         sausages! I can see a big grease 
                         spot in the midst of my most intimate 
                         moments!

               Leon knows on which note to play for Swana's benefit.

                                     LEON
                         Well, I am the last person to persuade 
                         you, but don't do it blindly... if 
                         this is your decision, you must be 
                         prepared to face the consequences...
                              (With the expression 
                              of a man ready to 
                              give his all)
                         I will have to go to work.

               Swana rises and goes over to Leon. His method has been highly 
               successful.

                                     SWANA
                         My little Volga boatman! Stop 
                         threatening! I don't deserve this.
                              (Embracing him)
                         Are you my little Volga boatman?

                                     LEON
                         Now, Swana...

                                     SWANA
                         First tell me, are you my little 
                         Volga boatman?

                                     LEON
                              (anything to stop her)
                         Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

                                     SWANA
                              (walking back to the 
                              dressing table)
                         Well... two million readers... I 
                         know exactly what they want. Chapter 
                         One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. 
                         Lovely Little Princess Plays with 
                         Rasputin's Beard."

               Leon sits down next to her, growing enthusiastic.

                                     LEON
                         I've got one chapter Guizot thinks 
                         is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." 
                         Swana escapes over the ice!

                                     SWANA
                         A couple of bloodhounds and we have 
                         Uncle Tom's Cabin.

                                     LEON
                              (thinking of another 
                              idea)
                         Darling, this would be wonderful! 
                         Just once... weren't you attacked by 
                         a Bolshevik?

                                     SWANA
                              (straining her memory)
                         Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!

                                     LEON
                         Too bad! Brings our price down ten 
                         thousand francs!

               There is a knock on the door.

                                     SWANA
                         Come in.

               The Maid enters.

                                     MAID
                         Count Rakonin asks the privilege of 
                         a few words, Your Highness.

                                     LEON
                         Count Rakonin?

                                     SWANA
                         He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor 
                         devil. You know him.

                                     LEON
                         Oh, yes.

                                     SWANA
                         Tell him I won't be able to see him 
                         for a half an hour.

                                     MAID
                         The Count says if it could be as 
                         soon as possible. It is luncheon 
                         time and he is just between courses.

               The Maid exits. Swana walks toward the door of the living 
               room.

               LIVING ROOM -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

               A charming room, which manages to create a little of the 
               atmosphere of Old Russia. Rakonin stands, his overcoat still 
               buttoned about him, waiting nervously. Swana enters, leaving 
               the door ajar. Rakonin approaches her with the respect he 
               would have paid her at the Imperial Court.

                                     RAKONIN
                         Your Highness.

                                     SWANA
                         How do you do, my friend.

                                     RAKONIN
                         Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, 
                         but...

                                     SWANA
                         What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose 
                         your job?

                                     RAKONIN
                         No, madame, something of the utmost 
                         importance... it concerns your jewels.

                                     SWANA
                         My jewels?!

                                     RAKONIN
                         I remember one birthday of His 
                         Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had 
                         the honor of being on guard at the 
                         summer palace... I still see you 
                         bending before His Majesty... You 
                         wore your diadem and a necklace... 
                         your face seemed to be lighted by 
                         the jewels.

                                     SWANA
                              (puzzled)
                         Why do you bring this up after so 
                         many years?

                                     RAKONIN
                         They are here!... Your jewels!... 
                         Here in Paris!

                                     SWANA
                         Alexis! Do you know what you are 
                         saying?

                                     RAKONIN
                         This morning three Soviet agents 
                         arrived. I overheard a telephone 
                         conversation with Mercier, the 
                         jeweler. Your Highness, they are 
                         going to sell them!

               MEDIUM SHOT -- DOOR OF BEDROOM

               From the door of the bedroom appears Leon, his face alert.

                                     LEON
                         Did I hear something about jewels?

                                     SWANA
                         Rakonin, bless him, has given me the 
                         most amazing news!

               MEDIUM CLOSE -- SWANA AND RAKONIN

               Swana goes to the telephone.

                                     SWANA
                              (into phone)
                         Balzac 2769...
                              (to Leon)
                         My lawyer...

               Leon steps to her side, highly interested.

                                     RAKONIN
                         I am sorry... I have to leave.

                                     SWANA
                              (to Rakonin)
                         Thank you so much, my friend. I will 
                         get in touch with you.

               Count Rakonin leaves.

                                     SWANA
                              (into phone)
                         This is the Duchess Swana... I want 
                         to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... 
                         it's very important... please get 
                         him right away... Hello, Monsieur 
                         Cornillon? The most incredible thing 
                         has happened! My jewels are here in 
                         Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are 
                         trying to sell them! Yes... yes... 
                         we must act immediately!... Call the 
                         police... Have them arrested!... 
                         Well, then, get an injunction!... 
                         But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!
                              (apparently the answer 
                              is some objection 
                              from Cornillon)
                         ...But they are my jewels! There 
                         must be some way of getting them 
                         back!

                                     LEON
                              (just as nervous as 
                              Swana)
                         What does he say?

                                     SWANA
                              (to Leon)
                         Shhh!
                              (into phone)
                         ...But how can there be a question?... 
                         Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All 
                         right, I'll let you know!

               She hangs up, rises, the legal situation whirling around in 
               her brain.

                         What did he say?

                              (discouraged)
                         It looks pretty hopeless... there 
                         may be a chance... that's all... The 
                         French Government has recognized 
                         Soviet Russia and he doubts that 
                         they will risk a war for my poor 
                         sake. He might be able to make up 
                         some kind of a case but it would 
                         cost money, money, money!... That's 
                         all they are interested in -- those 
                         lawyers!

                                     LEON
                              (taking her in his 
                              arms)
                         Darling, calm down. Why do you need 
                         a lawyer? Haven't you your little 
                         Volga boatman?

               Swana looks up at him, hope dawning in her eyes, as we

               INSERT OF THE JEWELS

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               spread out on a table in the Royal Suite. Camera pulls back 
               to a LONGER SHOT. We see Mercier, the jeweler, examining the 
               jewels with an eyepiece screwed in his eye. Around him stand 
               the Three Russians. Mercier, a middle-aged man of the greatest 
               suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, 
               looks up.

                                     MERCIER
                         Very good... superb... excellent... 
                         it would be foolish to belittle the 
                         quality of the merchandise but your 
                         terms are impossible. My counteroffer 
                         is the absolute maximum.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         But, Monsieur Mercier...

                                     MERCIER
                              (continuing)
                         Gentlemen, I'll let you in on a little 
                         secret... we are only undertaking 
                         this deal for the prestige involved, 
                         and, quite frankly, we are expecting 
                         to take a loss.

               Iranoff draws Buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (whispering)
                         Capitalistic methods...

                                     BULJANOFF
                         They accumulate millions by taking 
                         loss after loss.

               The telephone rings.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (answering phone)
                         Hello... this is Buljanoff, Iranoff, 
                         and Kopalski... Who?... Count 
                         d'Algout?... No, no... it must be a 
                         mistake... we can't be disturbed.

                                     MERCIER
                              (continuing)
                         I assure you no one else could meet 
                         the figure named by my syndicate... 
                         at least under the present economic 
                         conditions.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We can wait.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (pompously)
                         Do we give the impression of people 
                         who are pressed for money?

                                     MERCIER
                         Yes. Gentlemen... let's put our cards 
                         face down. Right now there is a 
                         Russian commission in New York trying 
                         to sell fifteen Rembrandts. There is 
                         another in London mortgaging the oil 
                         fields in Baku. You need money and 
                         you need it quickly. I think my offer 
                         is fair and does not even take 
                         advantage of your situation.

               CLOSE-UP -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (to Mercier)
                         Just a minute.

               The Three Russians step to one side.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (in a low voice)
                         He's cutting our throat...

                                     BULJANOFF
                         But what can we do?... We have to 
                         accept.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give 
                         in so quickly. After all we have to 
                         uphold the prestige of Russia.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         All right, let's uphold it for another 
                         ten minutes.

               SHOT OF THE WHOLE GROUP

               There is a knock at the door. Iranoff walks toward it, unlocks 
               it, opens it a little. In the door appears Leon.

                                     IRANOFF
                         We don't want to be disturbed.

                                     LEON
                         My name is Count d'Algout. I 
                         telephoned.

                                     IRANOFF
                         If you want to see us you must come 
                         later.

                                     LEON
                         I just want a word with Monsieur 
                         Mercier.

                                     IRANOFF
                         But you can't...

               Leon pushes his way in. He approaches Monsieur Mercier. The 
               Russians get between him and the jewels and during the 
               following scene put them back into the safe.

                                     LEON
                         Monsieur Mercier. May I introduce 
                         myself? I am Count Leon d'Algout. I 
                         think I had the pleasure of meeting 
                         you in your beautiful shop. I was 
                         admiring a platinum watch with diamond 
                         numbers.

                                     MERCIER
                         Oh, yes, yes...

                                     LEON
                              (glancing at the jewels)
                         Glorious, aren't they?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Now, monsieur, you have no right...

                                     LEON
                              (very charmingly)
                         Just a moment.
                              (to Mercier)
                         I hope you haven't closed this deal, 
                         Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you 
                         into serious difficulties.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         Who are you? What do you want? What 
                         is this?

                                     LEON
                         These jewels are the property of the 
                         Duchess Swana of Russia, and were 
                         seized illegally by the Soviet 
                         Government. I am acting for Her 
                         Highness, the Duchess. Here is my 
                         power of attorney.

               He hands it to Mercier, who reads it.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (excitedly)
                         You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is 
                         all non-sense.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         These may have been the jewels of 
                         the Duchess Swana, but, like all 
                         private property, they were 
                         confiscated by the State.

                                     LEON
                         We'll leave the problem of their 
                         ownership to the French courts. 
                         Meanwhile I have filed a petition 
                         for an injunction to prohibit you 
                         from either selling or removing the 
                         jewels. Here is a copy.

               The Russians take the copy of the injunction, read it 
               flabbergasted. As they do so, Leon turns to Monsieur Mercier.

                                     LEON
                         I thought it my duty to warn you. I 
                         would hate to see you get in any 
                         trouble, monsieur.

                                     MERCIER
                         Thank you.
                              (he turns to the 
                              Russians)
                         Gentlemen, this introduces a new 
                         element into our negotiations. Until 
                         this claim is completely settled...

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We can call our ambassador.

                                     IRANOFF
                         I give you my word! They were 
                         confiscated legally!

                                     MERCIER
                         Please try to understand my position. 
                         I am not with-drawing. My offer stands 
                         and as soon as you produce a clear 
                         title, approved by the French courts, 
                         the deal is settled. Until then, 
                         good day.

               He bows and starts toward the door. Leon accompanies him, 
               opening the door as though he were the host.

                                     LEON
                              (intimately)
                         I hope you will forgive me, Monsieur 
                         Mercier.

                                     MERCIER
                              (in a low voice)
                         On the contrary. I consider myself 
                         very lucky. Good day.

               He bows.

                                     LEON
                              (bowing)
                         Good day, monsieur.

               Mercier leaves. Leon closes the door and turns back into the 
               room to the three outraged Russians.

                                     LEON
                              (jauntily)
                         Well, gentlemen... how about a little 
                         lunch?

                                     IRANOFF
                         Get out of here!

                                     LEON
                         Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All 
                         is not lost. You may have a chance.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (bursting forth)
                         We may have a chance.

                                     LEON
                         Yes... a very slim one. I want to be 
                         fair. I don't deny that you might 
                         make out some kind of a case.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We haven't anything to discuss with 
                         you. We'll talk to a lawyer!

                                     LEON
                         All right -- go ahead... you talk to 
                         the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!

                                     IRANOFF
                         That won't help you! You can't 
                         intimidate us!

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Soviet Russia will put all its might 
                         behind this case.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         You think because you represent the 
                         former Duchess...

                                     LEON
                         The Duchess...

                                     BULJANOFF
                         The former Duchess!

                                     LEON
                         In any case, gentlemen, a charming, 
                         beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn 
                         you, if this case comes to trial it 
                         will be before a French court, and 
                         when the Duchess takes the stand...

                                     IRANOFF
                         All right, go ahead, get her on the 
                         witness stand! What can she say?

                                     LEON
                         But how will she look? The fashions 
                         this spring are very becoming to 
                         her. Gentlemen, the judge will be 
                         French, the jury will be French, 
                         everybody in that courtroom will be 
                         French. Have you ever seen a French 
                         court when a beautiful woman sits on 
                         the witness stand and lifts her skirt 
                         a little? You sit down and pull up 
                         your pants and where will it get 
                         you?

                                     IRANOFF
                         I suppose you expect us to hand over 
                         the jewels?

                                     LEON
                         Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, 
                         I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying 
                         to do is make things as difficult as 
                         possible.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Not that we are giving in one inch, 
                         but tell us... what is in your mind?

                                     LEON
                         Well, gentlemen, how about my 
                         proposition?

                                     IRANOFF
                         What proposition?

                                     LEON
                         I just said let's have a little lunch.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- CORRIDOR OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               shooting toward door leading to the Royal Suite. Two waiters 
               are wheeling in a table on which is a block of ice filled 
               with caviar and a collection of the most delicious hors 
               d'oeuvres. They enter the room. After the door is closed we 
               hear from within loud SOUNDS of approval from Buljanoff, 
               Iranoff, and Kopalski. The CAMERA STAYS on the door. After a 
               few seconds a very good-looking cigarette girl enters the 
               room and from within we HEAR even louder SOUNDS of approval. 
               Next a waiter enters carrying champagne and another with 
               glasses on a tray. As they are going into the room, the 
               cigarette girl comes out and runs excitedly down the corridor. 
               Camera pans with her away from the door as she starts down 
               the staircase.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- DOOR OF THE ROYAL SUITE

               Some of the waiters come out, others go in, carrying further 
               delicacies.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- HEAD OF STAIRCASE

               Up the staircase pants the cigarette girl, followed by two 
               other cigarette girls. Camera pans with them as they rush 
               toward the door of the Royal Suite and enter. From within we 
               HEAR terrific greetings. The CAMERA REMAINS ON THE DOOR as 
               we SLOWLY DISSOLVE INTO EVENING.

               The electric lights are lit and a band of five Hungarian 
               musicians enters carrying typical Hungarian instruments, 
               including a cimbalom.

               LONG SHOT -- ROYAL SUITE

               The orchestra is playing; the Three Russians, very high by 
               now, are dancing with the girls. One of them is wearing the 
               cigarette tray of one of the girls. It is a harmless but 
               loud and hilarious party. Apart from all the hullabaloo sits 
               Leon at the desk, a telegraph blank before him.

                                     LEON
                         Hey, Sascha! Serge! Misha!

               The three come to him, all in the gayest, most agreeable 
               mood.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Yes, Leon...

                                     IRANOFF
                              (pawing him)
                         What is it, my boy?

                                     LEON
                         About this telegram to Moscow. Why 
                         should you bother? I'll write it for 
                         you.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Leon... Leonitchka...
                              (he embraces Leon)
                         Why are you so good to us?
                              (he kisses Leon)

                                     IRANOFF
                              (kissing Leon too)
                         Leon, my little boy.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (joining them)
                         Oh, Leon, you are so good.

                                     LEON
                              (freeing himself as 
                              best he can)
                         What's the name of that Commissar on 
                         the Board of Trade?

                                     IRANOFF
                         Razinin.

                                     LEON
                              (writing)
                         Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         You wouldn't like Razinin.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         He's a bad man. Sends people to 
                         Siberia!

                                     IRANOFF
                         We don't like Razinin.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (again pawing Leon)
                         We like you, Leon -- don't we like 
                         Leon?

               The others join him and kiss Leon.

                                     IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI
                         Yes, we like Leon... little 
                         Leonitchka.

               This brings on a new frenzy of Russian affection. Leon frees 
               himself and rises.

                                     LEON
                         How does this strike you? Commissar 
                         Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. 
                         Unexpected situation here. Duchess 
                         Swana in Paris claims jewels, and 
                         has already brought injunction against 
                         sale or removal. After long and 
                         careful study we suggest in the 
                         interest of our beloved country a 
                         fifty-fifty settlement as best 
                         solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and 
                         Kopalski.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         If we say that, Leon... we'll be 
                         sent to Siberia!

                                     IRANOFF
                         And if we have to go to Siberia...

                                     LEON
                              (still looking over 
                              the telegram)
                         I'll send you a muff.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Oh, why are you so good to us?

                                     IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI
                         Yes, you are so good, Leon.

               Again they overwhelm Leon with an avalanche of Russian 
               affection. At this moment Rakonin enters with some new bottles 
               of champagne. The Russians immediately leave Leon and direct 
               their affection toward Rakonin, embracing and kissing him.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         Comrade waiter, dear waiteritchka!... 
                         Why are you so good to us? You good 
                         waiter!

               After Rakonin has turned over the champagne to the Russians, 
               Leon takes him aside.

                                     LEON
                         Take this telegram to the telegraph 
                         office at once!

                                     RAKONIN
                         Yes, monsieur.

               He leaves the room.

               CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR LEADING TO CORRIDOR OF HOTEL CLARENCE

               Rakonin comes out with the telegram. The CAMERA PANS with 
               him as he hurries down the corridor, reading it. The CAMERA 
               NARROWS DOWN on an insert of the telegram as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               TELEGRAPH WIRES OVER A WIDE SWEEP OF COUNTRY

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               TELEGRAPH WIRES OVER THE ROOFS OF MOSCOW

               Pan down past the roof of an official building to a CLOSE 
               SHOT of a window. Behind it stands Razinin, reading the 
               telegram. He is a violent, militant Bolshevik.

               The telegram fills him with rage. As he crumples it, and 
               stares into space, his expression bodes ill for Buljanoff, 
               Iranoff, and Kopalski.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- UPPER CORRIDOR OF HOTEL CLARENCE

               FADE IN:

               shooting toward door of elevator. The elevator comes up and 
               stops, the door opens, and the Three Russians step out. They 
               are very smartly dressed and look like any urbane gentlemen 
               coming from the races. Two of them have racing glasses. As 
               they walk toward the Royal Suite, Lady Lavenham, an elderly 
               English aristocrat, comes out of her room.

                                     LADY LAVENHAM
                         Good afternoon, messieurs, mes 
                         Comrades.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         Good afternoon, Lady Lavenham.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         And how is Lord Lavenham?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         ...and little Lady Beatrice?

                                     LADY LAVENHAM
                         Very well. Did fortune favor you at 
                         the races?

                                     IRANOFF
                         Comme ci, comme ca.

                                     LADY LAVENHAM
                         I understand... nothing to write 
                         home about.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (alarmed)
                         Who wants to write home about it?

                                     LADY LAVENHAM
                         It's just a saying. How about joining 
                         us Saturday night for dinner? We're 
                         having a few friends.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Are we free, Buljanoff?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Possibly.

                                     IRANOFF
                         We'll manage.

                                     LADY LAVENHAM
                         Then let's say at nine.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Black tie or white tie?

                                     LADY LAVENHAM
                         Oh, let's make it white.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Certainly!

                                     LADY LAVENHAM
                         Au revoir.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         Au revoir.

               As they walk into the Royal Suite, Buljanoff tosses off an 
               urbane comment.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Nice people.

               ANTEROOM OF ROYAL SUITE

               As the three enter, the telephone rings. Buljanoff and 
               Kopalski go into the living room. Iranoff answers the 
               telephone.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (into telephone)
                         Yes, Leon...
                              (a little bit annoyed)
                         What is it, Leon?... You can't hurry 
                         such things... You must give Moscow 
                         a little time... There's nothing we 
                         can do about it... why don't you 
                         drop in later?... Au revoir...

               He steps into the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               As Iranoff enters Buljanoff rushes toward him.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Misha! Misha!

                                     IRANOFF
                         What is it?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         A telegram from Moscow! It must have 
                         been here all day!

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (joining them and 
                              reading telegram)
                         Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy 
                         extraordinary arrives Thursday six 
                         ten with full power. Your authority 
                         cancelled herewith. Razinin.

                                     IRANOFF
                         It is Thursday!

                                     BULJANOFF
                         It's six o'clock already!

               They rush into the bedroom.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         I always said it would be Siberia!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE

               Manager at desk. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski rush from 
               the direction of the elevator. Iranoff pauses at the desk. 
               The others go on to the door and wait for him there.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (to Manager)
                         A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. 
                         He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move 
                         our things to the smallest room you've 
                         got.

                                     MANAGER
                         Yes, monsieur.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Right away... instantly!

               From the door Buljanoff and Kopalski call impatiently.

                                     BULJANOFF AND KOPALSKI
                         Iranoff!

                                     IRANOFF
                         I'm coming!

               As he starts toward the door, we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PLATFORM -- PARIS RAILROAD STATION

               The train has already arrived as the Three Russians hurry 
               down the platform. Neither do they know the name of the Envoy 
               Extraordinary, nor his appearance, and they are searching 
               the crowd for some clue.

                                     IRANOFF
                         This is a fine thing. Maybe we've 
                         missed him already.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         How can you find somebody without 
                         knowing what he looks like?

               Iranoff points to a bearded man with a knapsack.

                                     IRANOFF
                         That must be the one!

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Yes, he looks like a comrade!

               They follow the man, but just as they are ready to approach 
               him he is greeted by a German Girl. Both raise their hands 
               in the Nazi salute.

                                     BEARDED MAN AND GIRL
                         Heil Hitler!

               As the two embrace, the Three Russians stop in their tracks.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         No, that's not him...

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Positively not!

               By now the platform is almost empty. As the Russians in the 
               foreground look around helplessly, we see in the background 
               a woman who obviously is also looking for someone. It is 
               Ninotchka Yakushova, the Envoy Extraordinary. The Russians 
               exchange troubled looks and go toward her. Ninotchka comes 
               forward. As they meet she speaks.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (to Iranoff)
                         I am looking for Michael Simonovitch 
                         Iranoff.

                                     IRANOFF
                         I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy 
                         Extraordinary, acting under direct 
                         orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. 
                         Present me to your colleagues.

               They shake hands. Ninotchka's grip is strong as a man's.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Comrade Buljanoff...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Comrade.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Comrade Kopalski...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Comrade.

                                     IRANOFF
                         What a charming idea for Moscow to 
                         surprise us with a lady comrade.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         If we had known we would have greeted 
                         you with flowers.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (sternly)
                         Don't make an issue of my womanhood. 
                         We are here for work... all of us. 
                         Let's not waste time. Shall we go?

               The Russians are taken aback. As Ninotchka bends down to 
               lift her two suitcases, Iranoff calls:

                                     IRANOFF
                         Porter!

               A Porter steps up to them.

                                     PORTER
                         Here, please...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         What do you want?

                                     PORTER
                         May I have your bags, madame?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Why?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         He is a porter. He wants to carry 
                         them.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (to Porter)
                         Why?... Why should you carry other 
                         people's bags?

                                     PORTER
                         Well... that's my business, madame.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         That's no business... that's a social 
                         injustice.

                                     PORTER
                         That depends on the tip.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (trying to take 
                              Ninotchka's bags)
                         Allow me, Comrade.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No, thank you.

               Ninotchka takes both suitcases and walks away with the Three 
               Russians, whose nervousness has increased with every word 
               from the Envoy Extraordinary.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         How are things in Moscow?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Very good. The last mass trials were 
                         a great success. There are going to 
                         be fewer but better Russians.

               The hearts of the Three Russians drop to their boots, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE

               Ninotchka, followed by the Russians, comes through the lobby, 
               observing every detail of these unfamiliar surroundings.

               Suddenly she stops. In the showcase of a hat shop in the 
               lobby is displayed a hat of the John-Frederic's type.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         What's that?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.

               Ninotchka shakes her head.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Tsk, tsk, tsk, how can such a 
                         civilization survive which permits 
                         women to put things like that on 
                         their heads. It won't be long now, 
                         Comrades.

               She walks out of the shot toward the elevator, followed by 
               the Three Russians, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ROYAL SUITE

               Ninotchka enters, followed by the Three Russians, who by now 
               are frightened to death.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         This is the apartment we have reserved 
                         for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope 
                         you like it.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (glancing around the 
                              tremendous room)
                         Which part of the room is mine?

                                     IRANOFF
                         You see... it is a little different 
                         here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. 
                         We had to take the whole suite.

               Ninotchka begins to unpack her things and puts her typewriter 
               on the desk.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         How much does this cost?

                                     IRANOFF
                         Two thousand francs.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         A week?

                                     IRANOFF
                         A day.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Do you know how much a cow costs, 
                         Comrade Iranoff?

                                     IRANOFF
                         A cow?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Two thousand francs. If I stay here 
                         a week I will cost the Russian people 
                         seven cows.
                              (with an outburst of 
                              emotion)
                         Who am I to cost the Russian people 
                         seven cows?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         We had to take it on account of the 
                         safe.

                                     IRANOFF
                         For ourselves... we are much happier 
                         now since we moved to a little room 
                         next to the servants' quarters.

               Ninotchka takes Lenin's picture from her bags.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I am ashamed to put the picture of 
                         Lenin in a room like this.
                              (she puts the 
                              photograph on the 
                              desk)
                         Comrades, your telegram was received 
                         with great disfavor in Moscow.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We did our best, Comrade.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I hope so for your sake.
                              (she sits at her desk 
                              and starts to type 
                              her report)
                         Let us examine the case. What does 
                         the lawyer say?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Which lawyer?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You didn't get legal advice?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         We didn't want to get mixed up with 
                         lawyers. They are very expensive 
                         here. If you just say hello to a 
                         lawyer... well, there goes another 
                         cow.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We dealt directly with the 
                         representative of the Grand Duchess. 
                         I am sure if we call him he will 
                         give you a very clear picture.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I will not repeat your mistake. I 
                         will have no dealings with the Grand 
                         Duchess nor her representative.

               Ninotchka continues to type. The Three Russians watch her 
               nervously. Each click pounds on their consciences.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (looking up)
                         Comrade Buljanoff...

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Yes, Comrade?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Do you spell Buljanoff with one or 
                         two f's?

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (with fright in his 
                              voice)
                         With two f's, if you please.

               Ninotchka goes on with her typing. Suddenly she looks up at 
               Iranoff, who becomes self-conscious and fixes his tie. As he 
               does so he sees that Ninotchka's glance is concentrated on 
               the spats which he was wearing and in his hurry forgot to 
               remove. He knows it is too late to do anything about it except 
               to stand one foot behind the other, as Ninotchka types faster, 
               the clicking of her keys twice as loud. Ninotchka picks up 
               the telephone.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (into phone)
                         Will you send me some cigarettes, 
                         please?
                              (suddenly getting up)
                         Comrades, I am not in a position to 
                         pass final judgment but at best you 
                         have been careless in your duty to 
                         the State.
                              (with utmost gravity)
                         You were entrusted with more than a 
                         mere sale of jewelry. Why are we 
                         peddling our precious possessions to 
                         the world at this time? Our next 
                         year's crop is in danger and you 
                         know it. Unless we can get foreign 
                         currency to buy tractors there will 
                         not be enough bread for our people. 
                         And you three comrades...

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We did it with the best intentions...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         We cannot feed the Russian people on 
                         your intentions. Fifty per cent to a 
                         so-called Duchess!... Half of every 
                         loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade 
                         Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy 
                         and get the address of the best lawyer 
                         in Paris.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Yes, Comrade.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public 
                         Library and get me the section of 
                         the Civil Code on property.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Is there anything I can do, Comrade?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You might get me an accurate map of 
                         Paris. I want to use my spare time 
                         to inspect the public utilities and 
                         make a study of all outstanding 
                         technical achievements in the city.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Yes, Comrade.

               The buzzer rings.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Come in.

               The three Cigarette Girls enter.

                                     CIGARETTE GIRLS
                              (gaily)
                         Hello! Hello! Cigarettes?

               Ninotchka looks up astonished. Seeing her, the Cigarette 
               Girls freeze. The Russians stand by quietly.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (looking at the 
                              Russians)
                         Comrades, you seem to have been 
                         smoking a lot.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE -- EVENING

               FADE IN:

               shooting past the desk toward the revolving door. The 
               telephone rings and the Desk Clerk answers.

                                     DESK CLERK
                         Desk... yes, Monsieur Kopalski...
                              (he writes down the 
                              message)
                         ...you are expecting Count d'Algout... 
                         uh huh... but he is not to go to the 
                         Royal Suite under any circumstances. 
                         He should go to your new room, 985? 
                         Thank you, monsieur.
                              (he hangs up the 
                              receiver)

               A few seconds later Ninotchka, naturally completely unaware 
               of the telephone conversation, passes by. She carries a map 
               in her hand.

                                     DESK CLERK
                         Good evening, madame.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Good evening. She exits out the door.

               EXTERIOR, HOTEL CLARENCE

               Ninotchka emerges, unfolds the map.

               CLOSE-UP -- MAP OF PARIS

               in the hands of Ninotchka. The CAMERA ZOOMS down to a CLOSE-
               UP of the little drawing of the Hotel Clarence on the map. 
               The CAMERA then PANS OVER from the Clarence toward the 
               opposite side of the street, but before we reach the opposite 
               side we see that in the center of the street is a little 
               isle of safety. The CAMERA proceeds PANNING to the opposite 
               side of the square and we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The Real Location Corresponding to That Seen on the Map and 
               seen from the same ANGLE. It is evening, and along the street 
               comes Leon on his way to the hotel. The CAMERA PANS with him 
               as he crosses the street. He reaches the isle of safety and 
               there passes Ninotchka, who has come from the other side. 
               They pass on the little isle without noticing each other. 
               Suddenly we hear the whistle of a traffic policeman and both 
               Ninotchka and Leon have to step back to the little isle.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND LEON

               on the little isle. Wanting some information Ninotchka turns 
               to him -- completely impersonal.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You, please.

                                     LEON
                         Me?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes. Could you give me some 
                         information?

                                     LEON
                         Gladly.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         How long do we have to wait here?

                                     LEON
                         Well -- until the policeman whistles 
                         again.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         At what intervals does he whistle?

                                     LEON
                         What?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         How many minutes between the first 
                         and second whistle?

                                     LEON
                         That's funny. It's interesting. I 
                         never gave it a thought before.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Have you never been caught in a 
                         similar situation?

                                     LEON
                         Have I? Do you know when I come to 
                         think about it it's staggering. If I 
                         add it all up I must have spent years 
                         waiting for signals. Imagine! An 
                         important part of my life wasted 
                         between whistles.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         In other words you don't know.

                                     LEON
                         No.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thank you.

                                     LEON
                         You're welcome.

               Ninotchka gets out her map, starts to unfold it.

                                     LEON
                         Can I help you?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You might hold this for me.

                                     LEON
                         Love to.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (engrossed in her 
                              geography)
                         Correct me if I am wrong... We are 
                         facing north, aren't we?

                                     LEON
                              (bewildered)
                         Facing north... I'd hate to commit 
                         myself without my compass... Pardon 
                         me... are you an explorer?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No... I am looking for the Eiffel 
                         Tower.

                                     LEON
                         Is that thing lost again?... Listen... 
                         if you are interested in a view...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I am interested in the Eiffel Tower 
                         from a technical standpoint.

                                     LEON
                         Technical... I couldn't help you 
                         from that angle. You see, a real 
                         Parisian only goes to the top of the 
                         tower in moments of despair to jump

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         How long does it take a man to land?

                                     LEON
                         Now, isn't that too bad! The last 
                         time I jumped I forgot to clock it!
                              (looks at map)
                         Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your 
                         finger, please.

               He takes her finger and points to the map with it.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (skeptically)
                         Why do you need my finger?

                                     LEON
                         Bad manners to point with your own... 
                         Here... the Eiffel Tower.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         And where are we?

                                     LEON
                              (shifting her finger 
                              back to the hotel)
                         Here... here we are... here you are 
                         and here I am... feel it?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I am interested only in the shortest 
                         distance between these two points. 
                         Must you flirt?

                                     LEON
                         I don't have to but I find it natural.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Suppress it.

                                     LEON
                         I'll try.

               Ninotchka starts to fold her map.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         For my own information would you 
                         call your approach toward me typical 
                         of the local morale?

                                     LEON
                         Madame, it is that kind of approach 
                         which has made Paris what it is.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You are very sure of yourself, aren't 
                         you?

                                     LEON
                         Nothing has occurred recently to 
                         shake my confidence.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I have heard of the arrogant male in 
                         capitalistic society. It is having a 
                         superior earning power that makes 
                         you like that.

                                     LEON
                         A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... 
                         I have been fascinated by your Five-
                         Year Plan for the past fifteen years!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Your type will soon be extinct.

               She walks away from him coldly. Leon stares after her, 
               fascinated.

               ENTRANCE -- GROUND FLOOR OF THE EIFFEL TOWER

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Camera moves with Ninotchka as she enters. She approaches an 
               Attendant.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Please... can you tell me the exact 
                         width of the foundation on which the 
                         piers are resting?... and the depth?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You don't have to worry. The thing 
                         is safe.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I am not afraid... I want to know...

               Leon, who apparently has taken a taxi and prepared himself 
               otherwise, enters the scene, reading from a book.

                                     LEON
                              (reading)
                         The foundation is one hundred and 
                         forty-one yards square...
                              (he tips his hat and 
                              interjects)
                         I hope you'll forgive me but I thought 
                         you'd...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (interrupting)
                         Go ahead.

               The CAMERA goes with Ninotchka and Leon as they walk toward 
               the steps.

                                     LEON
                              (continuing)
                         Four massive piers of masonry are 
                         sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on 
                         the side of the Seine, and twenty-
                         nine and one-half feet on the other 
                         side. The girders of interlaced iron-
                         work which stay the structure have 
                         an inclination of fifty-four 
                         degrees...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         That's a strange angle.

                                     LEON
                         Yes, very strange.

               By now they have reached the staircase. They start up.

                                     LEON
                              (continuing to read)
                         Ascending to the tower is a staircase 
                         consisting of eight hundred and twenty-
                         nine steps...
                              (this disclosure 
                              frightens Leon as he 
                              realizes the climb 
                              ahead of him. He 
                              reads on as they 
                              walk up)
                         ...and an additional two hundred and 
                         fifty-four steps to the very top...
                              (now Leon stops but 
                              Ninotchka proceeds 
                              on out of the picture. 
                              Leon calls after her 
                              and reads from his 
                              book in a loud voice)
                         There is an elevator included in the 
                         price of admission!

               Ninotchka continues to climb.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- STAIRS (FROM LEON'S ANGLE)

               Ninotchka, paying no attention to him, walks up the stairs, 
               two at a time.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON

               He looks after Ninotchka, then makes up his mind and returns 
               down the stairs.

               GROUND FLOOR -- EIFFEL TOWER, shooting toward the elevator 
               door. The elevator with several passengers is just about to 
               leave when Leon hurries into it. The door closes and the 
               elevator starts to ascend quickly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               HIGHEST PLATFORM -- EIFFEL TOWER

               The CAMERA ANGLE includes the elevator door and a beautiful 
               background view of Paris. The elevator door opens and Leon 
               emerges leisurely. He is just about to step to the top of 
               the staircase, when suddenly, to his great amazement, he 
               sees Ninotchka, who stands at the balustrade overlooking 
               Paris. She has climbed the tower faster than he despite the 
               elevator. Dumbfounded, Leon approaches her. Ninotchka turns, 
               very matter-of-fact.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You gave me some very valuable 
                         information. Thank you.

                                     LEON
                              (looking at the 
                              dazzling view)
                         And thank you for getting me up here. 
                         I've never seen this before. 
                         Beautiful, isn't it?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes, it is.

                                     LEON
                         I'm glad I saw it before becoming 
                         extinct.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Do not misunderstand me. I do not 
                         hold your frivolity against you.
                              (she looks him up and 
                              down)
                         As basic material you might not be 
                         bad, but you are the unfortunate 
                         product of a doomed culture. I feel 
                         sorry for you.

                                     LEON
                         You must admit that this doomed old 
                         civilization sparkles... It glitters!

                         I do not deny its beauty, but it is 
                         a waste of electricity.

                                     LEON
                         What a city! There are the Grands 
                         Boulevards... blasted out of the 
                         heart of the old streets. The Arc de 
                         Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's 
                         army. The Opera! And Montmartre... 
                         Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now 
                         I'll show you the greatest attraction!

                              telescope and, taking

                              pocket, drops a coin 
                              in the slot)
                         It will cost me a franc but it is 
                         worth it.

                         What do you see?

                         I see a house that looks like any 
                         other house. What's remarkable about 
                         it?

                                     LEON
                         It's not the structure but the spirit 
                         which dwells within. There are three 
                         rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to 
                         hospitality.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         So that is your house?

                                     LEON
                         Well, let's say I live in it. Such a 
                         pleasant place... all kinds of 
                         comfort, easy to reach, close to 
                         street car, bus, and subway...

                              (straight from the 
                              shoulder)
                         Does that mean that you want me to 
                         go there?

                                     LEON
                              (feeling that he has 
                              offended her)
                         Please don't misunderstand me...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Then you don't want me to go there.

                                     LEON
                              (in a pickle)
                         Now I didn't say that either... 
                         naturally nothing would please me 
                         more.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (simply)
                         Then why don't we go?
                              (looking at him)
                         You might be an interesting subject 
                         of study.

                                     LEON
                         I will do my best.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INTERIOR, ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT

               In the foreground stands a console on which is a telephone.

               Gaston, Leon's elderly, dignified butler, is answering the 
               phone.

                                     GASTON
                              (into phone)
                         No... Count d'Algout is still out. 
                         Yes, as soon as he returns I'll tell 
                         him. Yes... I'll tell him Monsieur 
                         Buljanoff.

               He puts down the receiver as Leon opens the door with his 
               key. Ninotchka and Leon enter. Ninotchka, during the following 
               scene, is studying every detail of the apartment with the 
               eye of a technical expert.

                                     LEON
                         Good evening, Gaston.

                                     GASTON
                         Good evening, Monsieur.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Is this what you call the "butler"?

                                     LEON
                         Yes.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (takes Gaston's hand)
                         Good evening, comrade.
                              (to Leon)
                         This man is horribly old. You should 
                         not make him work.

                                     LEON
                         He takes good care of that.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         He looks sad. Do you whip him?

                                     LEON
                         No, though the mere thought makes my 
                         mouth water.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (to the completely 
                              flabbergasted Gaston)
                         The day will come when you will be 
                         free. Go to bed, little father. We 
                         want to be alone.

               Leon opens the door to the living room. Ninotchka enters. 
               Just as he is about to follow her, Gaston addresses him.

                                     GASTON
                              (in a low voice)
                         Count d'Algout, there have been 
                         several telephone...

                                     LEON
                         Go to bed.

               INTERIOR, LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

               Leon enters the room. Closes the door. Ninotchka is examining 
               the room.

                                     LEON
                         Well, may I offer you a drink, or 
                         how about something to eat?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thank you. I've had all the calories 
                         necessary for today.

               Leon feels a little uncertain as to how to approach this 
               creature.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         What do we do now?

                                     LEON
                         We take off our hat and coat.
                              (he takes her things)
                         We sit down -- we make ourselves 
                         comfortable. We adjust ourselves to 
                         the prospect of a most enjoyable 
                         evening. We look at each other. We 
                         smile.
                              (Ninotchka doesn't 
                              respond)
                         Well... we don't smile. How about 
                         some music?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Is that customary?

                                     LEON
                         It helps. It has ever since King 
                         David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. 
                         As I am not so fortunate as to have 
                         my harp at hand, I shall turn on the 
                         radio.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (the observer)
                         I should say this room is eighteen 
                         by twenty-five.

                                     LEON
                         Not too big and not too small. What 
                         I'd call the typical room of an 
                         average man. Or shall we say a little 
                         above average. Now if there are any 
                         special aspects you wish to study I 
                         have nothing to conceal. Just look 
                         around. That's my desk. Those are my 
                         books, and here am I. Where shall we 
                         begin?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I will start with you.

                                     LEON
                         That's great. I'm thirty-five years 
                         old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh 
                         a hundred and eighty-two pounds 
                         stripped.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         And what is your profession?

                                     LEON
                         Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind 
                         alert, keeping my landlord appeased. 
                         That's a full-time job.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         And what do you do for mankind?

                                     LEON
                         For mankind not a thing -- for 
                         womankind the record is not quite so 
                         bleak.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You are something we do not have in 
                         Russia.

                                     LEON
                         Thank you. Thank you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         That is why I believe in the future 
                         of my country.

                                     LEON
                         I begin to believe in it myself since 
                         I've met you. I still don't know 
                         what to make of it. It confuses me, 
                         it frightens me a little, but it 
                         fascinates me, Ninotchka.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni-
                         notchka.

                                     LEON
                         Ni-notchka.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         That is correct.

                                     LEON
                         Ninotchka, do you like me just a 
                         little bit?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Your general appearance is not 
                         distasteful.

                                     LEON
                         Thank you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Look at me. The whites of your eyes 
                         are clear. Your cornea is excellent.

                                     LEON
                         Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- 
                         you're so expert on things -- can it 
                         be that I'm falling in love with 
                         you?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You are bringing in wrong values. 
                         Love is a romantic designation for a 
                         most ordinary biological, or shall 
                         we say chemical, process. A lot of 
                         nonsense is talked and written about 
                         it.

                                     LEON
                         Oh, I see. What do you use instead?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I acknowledge the existence of a 
                         natural impulse common to all.

                                     LEON
                         What can I possibly do to encourage 
                         such an impulse in you?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You don't have to do a thing. 
                         Chemically we are already quite 
                         sympathetic.

                                     LEON
                              (bewildered, and yet 
                              completely intrigued)
                         You're the most improbable creature 
                         I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, 
                         Ninotchka...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You repeat yourself.

                                     LEON
                         I'd like to say it a thousand times.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Don't do it, please.

                                     LEON
                         I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must 
                         forgive me if I appear a little old-
                         fashioned. After all, I'm just a 
                         poor bourgeois.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It's never too late to change. I 
                         used to belong to the petty 
                         bourgeoisie myself. My father and 
                         mother wanted me to stay and work on 
                         the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.

                                     LEON
                              (bewildered)
                         The bayonet? Did you really?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I was wounded before Warsaw.

                                     LEON
                         Wounded? How?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry 
                         Brigade. Would you like to see my 
                         wound?

                                     LEON
                              (dumfounded)
                         I'd love to.
                              (she pulls the blouse 
                              off her shoulder and 
                              shows him her scar)
                         Tsk, tsk, tsk.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.

                                     LEON
                         Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (readjusting her blouse)
                         Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. 
                         After all, I'm alive.

               More and more puzzled and fascinated, Leon sits down close 
               to her.

                                     LEON
                         What kind of a girl are you, anyway?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Just what you see. A tiny cog in the 
                         great wheel of evolution.

                                     LEON
                         You're the most adorable cog I ever 
                         saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, 
                         let me confess something. Never did 
                         I dream I could feel like this toward 
                         a sergeant.

               A clock strikes.

                                     LEON
                         Do you hear that?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It's twelve o'clock.

                                     LEON
                         It's midnight. One half of Paris is 
                         making love to the other half. Look 
                         at the clock. One hand has met the 
                         other hand. They kiss. Isn't that 
                         wonderful?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         That's the way a clock works. There's 
                         nothing wonderful about it. You merely 
                         feel you must put yourself in a 
                         romantic mood to add to your 
                         exhilaration.

                                     LEON
                         I can't possibly think of a better 
                         reason.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It's false sentimentality.

                                     LEON
                              (trying desperately 
                              to make her mood 
                              more romantic)
                         You analyze everything out of 
                         existence. You analyze me out of 
                         existence. I won't let you. Love is 
                         not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, 
                         why do doves bill and coo? Why do 
                         snails, coldest of all creatures, 
                         circle interminably around each other? 
                         Why do moths fly hundreds of miles 
                         to find their mates? Why do flowers 
                         open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, 
                         Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight 
                         symptom of the divine passion... a 
                         general warmth in the palms of your 
                         hands... a strange heaviness in your 
                         limbs... a burning of the lips that 
                         is not thirst but a thousand times 
                         more tantalizing, more exalting, 
                         than thirst?

               He pauses, waiting for the results of his speech.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You are very talkative.

               That is too much for Leon. He takes her into his arms and 
               kisses her.

                                     LEON
                         Was that talkative?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No, that was restful. Again.

               Leon kisses her again.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thank you.

                                     LEON
                         Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My 
                         impossible, unromantic, statistical...

               The telephone rings.

                                     LEON
                              (continuing)
                         Glorious, analytical...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         The telephone is ringing.

                                     LEON
                         Oh, let it ring.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         But one of your friends may be in 
                         need of you. You must answer.

               Leon exits out of shot to answer telephone.

               CLOSE SHOT -- AT DESK

               Leon enters, sits down, takes the telephone.

                                     LEON
                              (into phone)
                         Hello?... Yes... I'm sorry but I 
                         couldn't make it. I ran into a friend 
                         from the army... What?... The deal 
                         is off! Are you crazy, Buljanoff?...

               CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA

               She is startled by the name.

               LEON -- AT TELEPHONE

                                     LEON
                         ...A special envoy arrived... What?... 
                         That sounds better. I'll be glad to 
                         see her any time she wants... Oh, 
                         she doesn't want to see me? What do 
                         you know about that? Why?... Well, 
                         I'll get in touch with her myself. 
                         What's her name?...
                              (he takes a pencil 
                              and a piece of paper)
                         ...What?... Yaku... How do you spell 
                         it?... Heavens! those Russian names!
                              (he starts to write 
                              it down)
                         ...I... Oh, Y...

               Camera pulls back and Ninotchka enters the shot. She takes 
               pencil from Leon's hand, writes out the name, and leaves 
               again. At first Leon is not aware of the full significance 
               of her action. Then it dawns on him.

                                     LEON
                              (continuing)
                         Yakushova... Ninotch...

               At last the situation is entirely clear to him.

                                     LEON
                              (into phone)
                         All right. Thank you.

               He hangs up and stares at Ninotchka. She is putting on her 
               jacket.

                                     LEON
                              (camera panning with 
                              him as he walks over 
                              to her)
                         Ninotchka...

               He takes her arm.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I must go.

                                     LEON
                         Ninotchka, or shall I say Special 
                         Envoy Yakushova...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Let's forget that we ever met.

                                     LEON
                         I have a better suggestion. Let's 
                         forget that the telephone ever rang. 
                         I never heard that you are 
                         Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my 
                         Ninotchka...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (firmly)
                         I was sent here by my country to 
                         fight you.

                                     LEON
                         All right, fight me, fight me as 
                         much as you want, but fight me 
                         tomorrow morning! There's nothing 
                         sweeter than sharing a secret with a 
                         bitter enemy.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (uncompromisingly)
                         As a representative of Moscow...

                                     LEON
                         Tonight let's not represent anybody 
                         but ourselves.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It is out of the question. If you 
                         wish to approach me...

                                     LEON
                         You know I want to...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Then do it through my lawyer!

                                     LEON
                              (desperate)
                         Ninotchka, you can't walk out like 
                         this... I'm crazy about you, and I 
                         thought I'd made an impression on 
                         you. You liked the white of my eye.

               Ninotchka looks at him for a second, then pulls herself 
               together.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I must go.

               She starts for the door.

                                     LEON
                         But, Ninotchka, I held you in my 
                         arms. You kissed me!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I kissed the Polish lancer too... 
                         before he died.

               As she goes out, we

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               THE ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT

               FADE IN:

               (Note: We have to invent some brief scene to indicate that 
               three days have gone by. From this we)

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The butler opens the door. Swana enters, her manner showing 
               her complete familiarity with the place.

                                     GASTON
                         Good morning, Your Highness.

                                     SWANA
                         Good morning, Gaston.

                                     GASTON
                         Count d'Algout is still asleep.

                                     SWANA
                              (as she walks toward 
                              Leon's room)
                         That's all right.

               LEON'S BEDROOM

               The curtains are drawn. The night light is still on. Leon, a 
               dressing gown over his pajamas, is sound asleep in a big arm 
               chair. As Swana enters, she sees him with some alarm.

                                     SWANA
                         Leon! What in heaven's name...!

                                     LEON
                         Huh?

                                     SWANA
                         Is anything wrong? Are you ill?

                                     LEON
                         No.

                                     SWANA
                         Don't tell me the bed has lost its 
                         best friend.

                                     LEON
                         I just couldn't sleep. I got up and 
                         went back... and then got up again. 
                         These last few days... whew!

                                     SWANA
                         Darling, you're taking my business 
                         affairs far too seriously. Much as 
                         I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of 
                         their filthy money, I won't do it at 
                         the expense of your health. 
                         Particularly as we know we won't get 
                         much.
                              (tenderly)
                         You look so pale... pale but 
                         interesting.

               There is a knock at the door.

                                     SWANA
                         Come in.

               Gaston enters with a breakfast tray.

                                     GASTON
                         Your breakfast, monsieur.

                                     LEON
                         I don't feel like any breakfast.

                                     SWANA
                         Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds 
                         and make yourself agreeable to the 
                         Whites if you don't keep up your 
                         strength.

                                     GASTON
                         Shall I draw your bath, sir?

                                     LEON
                         Make it ice cold.

                                     SWANA
                         Not in your condition.
                              (to Gaston)
                         Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and 
                         tender. And lay out his gray suit.
                              (to Leon)
                         Afterwards I'll drive you through 
                         the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.

                                     GASTON
                         A blue shirt, perhaps?

                                     SWANA
                         Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a 
                         striped one, and brighten it with a 
                         great blaze of tie.

                                     GASTON
                         Very well, Your Highness.

               Gaston disappears into the bath-dressing room. Swana makes 
               Leon sit down and seats herself beside him.

                                     SWANA
                         Now... here we have two very handsome 
                         soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose 
                         hens mind what happens to their eggs? 
                         Probably not. They have such unfeeling 
                         eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of 
                         butter, plenty of pepper and salt... 
                         Darling, I haven't seen you for three 
                         livelong days... seventy-two hours!

                                     LEON
                              (irritably)
                         Oh, please, Swana! I don't know 
                         whether I'm standing on my head or 
                         my heels. Here you are blaming me 
                         for neglecting you when I'm trying 
                         to concentrate on another woman and 
                         can't get near her.

                                     SWANA
                         You haven't seen her yet?

                                     LEON
                         No, and believe me I've tried 
                         everything! I must have telephoned 
                         her a hundred times. I've sent her 
                         telegrams, I've sent her flowers... 
                         I asked her to dinner... I offered 
                         her seats for the Opera...

                                     SWANA
                         That proletarian! In the old days 
                         we'd have had her flogged.

                                     LEON
                         That wouldn't have done any good. 
                         Not with her.
                              (forgetting himself)
                         She's the most incredible creature 
                         I've ever seen.

                                     SWANA
                         You just told me you hadn't seen 
                         her.

                                     LEON
                         Well... er... I caught a glimpse of 
                         her when she walked through the lobby.

                                     SWANA
                         Imagine the carpets of a self-
                         respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by 
                         the boots of a muzhik! What does she 
                         look like?

                                     LEON
                         You can't imagine.

                                     SWANA
                         That bad?
                              (Leon nods)
                         Old or young?

                                     LEON
                         Timeless. When she comes into a room 
                         you'd think that the Bolsheviks had 
                         taken over Paris. She wears her cheap 
                         miserable blouse as though it were 
                         the latest model by Schiaparelli. 
                         What a woman! What a woman! There is 
                         a Russian snowstorm in each of her 
                         eyes.

                                     SWANA
                         You saw all that in one glimpse?

                                     LEON
                              (getting up)
                         Darling, if we're going to get 
                         anywhere someone has to keep his 
                         eyes open!
                              (he walks over to the 
                              bathroom)

                                     SWANA
                         Now, darling, soak in your beautiful 
                         pine bath and let Gaston shave you.

               Leon exits into the bathroom. As he does so a bell rings.

                                     SWANA
                         Gaston!

               There is no answer. After a slight pause she herself goes to 
               answer the bell.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT, shooting 
               toward the door.

               Swana goes to the door and opens it. The Three Russians stand 
               outside. Seeing Swana, they are a little intimidated.

                                     THE THREE RUSSIANS
                         How do you do?

               Swana suspects that for the first time she is being confronted 
               by representatives of the Soviet government.

                                     SWANA
                         Yes?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We want to talk to Count d'Algout. 
                         My name is Kopalski.

                                     SWANA
                         Oh... you are the three gentlemen 
                         from Moscow?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Yes.

                                     SWANA
                              (icily)
                         You may wait.

               She closes the door.

               STAIRCASE HALL -- IN FRONT OF LEON'S DOOR

               The Three Russians, very impressed, stand looking at the 
               door which has just been closed.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         That's her.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening 
                         the door for us.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Once in Petersburg I was driving 
                         down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart 
                         and Her Highness in her troika swept 
                         down from the opposite direction, 
                         and when I couldn't make way quick 
                         enough she spat in my face.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Now look here, Buljanoff. You never 
                         were in Petersburg, you never owned 
                         a cart, and she never spat in your 
                         face. Who are you trying to impress?

               At this moment the door is opened by Leon in his bathrobe.

                                     LEON
                         Hello, boys.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         Leon!

                                     LEON
                         Come in, come in.

               They enter.

               LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

               Leon and the Three Russians enter.

                                     LEON
                         What's new?

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (excitedly)
                         Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going 
                         to negotiate! She is going to fight 
                         that injunction. She's going to make 
                         a precedent of it!

                                     IRANOFF
                         She says she won't be intimidated by 
                         parasites. She called the Duchess a 
                         blood-sucking aristocrat and a 
                         blackmailer.

                                     LEON
                              (eagerly)
                         What did she say about me?

                                     IRANOFF
                              (after a moment's 
                              consideration)
                         I think she covered you with the 
                         parasites.

               Leon is disappointed.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         And Leonitchka! What she said about 
                         us...!

                                     IRANOFF
                         And they might believe her in Moscow.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         What do you mean they might -- they 
                         will!

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We don't blame you, Leon, but when 
                         we came from Russia we believed in 
                         simplicity...

                                     IRANOFF
                         We avoided luxury and extravagance 
                         and today... well, if you were to 
                         offer us a glass of champagne, we 
                         wouldn't say no.

               Leon is so engrossed in his thoughts that he overlooks the 
               hint.

                                     LEON
                         Well, boys, I'd like to help you but 
                         what can I do? Yesterday I waited 
                         six hours in the lobby!

                                     KOPALSKI
                         She doesn't leave her room! She has 
                         been locked in for the last two days 
                         with lawyers and law books!

                                     LEON
                         All right, then make an appointment 
                         with her so I can see her!

                                     KOPALSKI
                         We can't... but you are so ingenious, 
                         Leon...

                                     IRANOFF
                         You found your way to us and we 
                         weren't easy to reach, were we?

                                     LEON
                         No, no.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Didn't we put up a strong resistance?

                                     LEON
                         Oh, yes, yes.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         You must help us, Leon... if you 
                         don't win her over we're on our way 
                         to Siberia!

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Or it might be the firing squad!

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Or we can't go back to Russia!

               An idea dawns on Iranoff.

                                     IRANOFF
                         What's wrong with that?

               Kopalski and Buljanoff seize on the same idea.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Yes! We could stay with Leon!

                                     IRANOFF
                         Leon, how would you like to have 
                         three lifelong friends?

                                     LEON
                         Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is 
                         your mother country. Three sons 
                         walking out all at once... that's 
                         too much for any mother.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Well, if your mother turns against 
                         you, you have to look for someone to 
                         adopt you.

               Swana's voice comes from the next room.

                                     SWANA
                         Leon! Just a minute...

               Leon goes back to the other room.

               LEON'S BEDROOM -- CLOSE SHOT, shooting toward the door of 
               the living room.

               Swana stands putting on her gloves.

                                     SWANA
                         I'm leaving, dear. I'm lunching at 
                         Fouquet's if you can make it, and... 
                         Leon, remember, a man should think 
                         it over twice before he decides to 
                         become a mother.

               She kisses him lightly and walks out.

               LIVING ROOM -- ROYAL SUITE -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- AT THE 
               DESK

               It is piled deep with law books and papers. Ninotchka sits 
               at it, conferring with two Lawyers.

                                     FIRST LAWYER
                              (uncertainly)
                         I seem to remember some additional 
                         injunctive provision dealing with 
                         the property of foreigners residing 
                         in France.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (with the precision 
                              of a machine)
                         You are referring to paragraph 59b, 
                         section 25f of the Civil Code.

               The Lawyers exchange a glance of surprise at her knowledge. 
               One of them takes up one of the law books and as he starts 
               to look up the case, Ninotchka speaks.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Page eight hundred twenty-four.

               Again the Lawyers exchange a glance of astonishment.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         And do not fail to read the three 
                         footnotes. While you are studying it 
                         I will eat.
                              (She picks up the 
                              telephone)
                         Food please.

               A LITTLE CORNER IN THE ROOM SERVICE PANTRY

               Rakonin is answering the telephone.

                                     RAKONIN
                              (into phone)
                         Room service... Just a moment please.

               He beckons to someone out of the scene. Leon enters the scene 
               and takes the telephone.

                                     LEON
                              (with an assumed French 
                              accent -- into phone)
                         Room service speaking.

                              (into phone)
                         Send me a plate of raw carrots and 
                         beets, beets predominating on a ratio 
                         of sixty-forty... What? There is a 
                         strike in the kitchen? Good! Will 
                         you assure the strikers of my hearty 
                         sympathy in their cause. I hope they 
                         will not weaken in their demands and 
                         tell them to put no dressing 
                         whatsoever on my vegetables... What? 
                         You won't serve me either? Now look 
                         here, Comrade, I think it is a fine 
                         idea to let the capitalists go without 
                         luncheon but when you keep food away 
                         from me you're weakening the people.

                              (into phone)
                         So! You want to make a strike breaker 
                         out of me! I am surprised at you, 
                         Comrade! Is it too much for the 
                         workers of the world to ask you to 
                         walk around the corner for lunch? 
                         All I can say to you is take your 
                         hammer and sickle and get out of 
                         that Royal Suite!

               He hangs up the telephone with a triumphant smile.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

               Ninotchka emerges from the elevator and starts toward the 
               street. As she passes the showcase of the millinery shop 
               again, she stops and looks at the same hat. Again she shakes 
               her head sadly.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Tsk, tsk, tsk.

               She walks toward the street, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A taxi is parked at the curb. Ninotchka comes from the hotel 
               and goes to the taxi.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND TAXI DRIVER

               The Driver puts his hand on the handle of his cab's door 
               expectantly.

                                     TAXI DRIVER
                         Where to, madame?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Can you recommend a restaurant?

                                     TAXI DRIVER
                         Well, there's Pruniers if you care 
                         for seafood. If you want to lunch in 
                         the Bois, there's...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (interrupting)
                         Where do you eat?

                         Where is that?

                                     TAXI DRIVER
                         It's just a place for workmen.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Where is it?

                         Eight blocks down in the Rue de 
                         Poivrel.

               He opens the door of his cab.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thank you.

               She turns and starts away in the direction he has indicated. 
               The Driver looks after her astounded.

               The CAMERA PANS from her to the car which stands behind the 
               taxi. It is Leon's smart roadster. Leon sits at the wheel. 
               He too is looking after Ninotchka, astonished. He gets out 
               of his car and starts in the direction she has taken. As he 
               does so, we

               PARIS STREET -- IN FRONT OF PÈRE MATHIEU'S

               Père Mathieu's is a workman's restaurant set a few steps 
               below the level of the sidewalk. A few typical French workmen 
               are going in for lunch. Ninotchka enters the scene, looks 
               around for a second, then goes in too.

               INTERIOR -- PÈRE MATHIEU'S

               It is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting 
               at lunch. An electric piano is playing. Père Mathieu, greeting 
               all his guests like a typical restaurateur, sees Ninotchka 
               enter.

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                         This way, madame. Are you alone? By 
                         the window perhaps?
                              (He leads the way)
                         Or a nice little corner table?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         This will do.
                              (She sits down)

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                         I think this is the first time you 
                         have been to my little place. Your 
                         face is new to me. Now, what shall 
                         it be?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Raw carrots and beets.

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                              (horrified)
                         Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, 
                         not a meadow.

               He hands her a slate on which the menu is written.

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                         Here is what we are offering today. 
                         Please make your choice. I am sure 
                         you will find something to tempt 
                         your appetite.

               Suddenly Ninotchka stares in the direction of the door.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- AT THE DOOR

               Leon has just entered. The CAMERA follows him as he makes 
               his way casually in Ninotchka's direction affecting not to 
               see her. He seats himself at the table directly opposite 
               Ninotchka and pretends to be overwhelmed with surprise as he 
               sees her.

                                     LEON
                         Why, hello! It certainly is a small 
                         world!

               SHOT INCLUDING BOTH TABLES

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                              (to Ninotchka)
                         Well, madame? Shall we start with 
                         soup? Fish soup today. I got up at 
                         five to fish them from the Seine.

                                     LEON
                              (calling over to Père 
                              Mathieu)
                         Crayfish soup for me!

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                              (to Leon)
                         Very well, monsieur.
                              (back to Ninotchka)
                         Then, may I suggest an omelet with 
                         mushrooms?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Bring me something simple. I never 
                         think about food.

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                              (horrified)
                         But, madame! If you don't think about 
                         food what do you think about?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         The future of the common people.

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                              (sagely)
                         That also is a question of food, 
                         madame. I'll bring you a nice little 
                         lunch à la Père Mathieu.
                              (he exits)

               Leon leans toward Ninotchka with mock humility.

                                     LEON
                         Pardon me for addressing you but you 
                         insulted him, you know that. You 
                         hurt his feelings. It was just like 
                         telling a musician you don't like 
                         music. That good old man believes in 
                         food as you believe in Karl Marx. 
                         You can't go around hurting people, 
                         Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can 
                         make it up to him. Do you know how?
                              (He changes to the 
                              chair at his table 
                              which is closest to 
                              her table)
                         By eating everything with relish, by 
                         drinking everything with gusto, by 
                         having a good time for the first 
                         time in your natural life!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I don't like your following me.

                                     LEON
                         I didn't follow you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Then how did you get here?

                                     LEON
                         I always eat here.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         This is a place for workmen.

                                     LEON
                              (laying it on thick)
                         But my dear child, I am most at home 
                         among working men. I hate the places 
                         where you circulate -- the Hotel 
                         Clarence... This is my natural 
                         element. After all, what are any of 
                         us? Workingmen! At least, those of 
                         us who are worth our salt. Hyah?

               He waves off scene to a truckman.

               TRUCKMAN

               He is in the middle of an enormous gulp of food. He registers 
               surprise, winks at his companion, and then, deciding to humor 
               a drunk, waves back energetically at Leon in greeting.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA

               Leon has been so successful with the truckman he tries it on 
               another.

                                     LEON
                         Hyah!

               Another truckman responds with equal exuberance.

               LONG SHOT -- RESTAURANT

               Leon, intoxicated with his success, waves to the whole room.

                                     LEON
                         Hyah, fellows!

               He gets a wonderful response from all. They realize that a 
               swell drunk is among them.

               LEON AND NINOTCHKA

                                     LEON
                              (boastfully)
                         They are all my friends. They're a 
                         swell bunch!

               Père Mathieu enters the shot and serves a plate of soup to 
               Leon and one to Ninotchka.

                                     LEON
                              (trying his bluff on 
                              Père Mathieu)
                         Ah, my friend! I'm happy to see you 
                         again! 

                                     PÈRE MATHIEU
                         I'm always glad to meet a new 
                         customer, and I hope this first visit 
                         will not be your last.

               He exits out of shot.

               Ninotchka, her suspicion confirmed, looks at Leon.

                                     LEON
                         Just an old man. His memory is getting 
                         weak.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         What are you after?

                                     LEON
                         Must one always be after something?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Your tactics are useless. My name is 
                         neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor 
                         Kopalski.

                                     LEON
                         Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk 
                         business. If you win the suit, fine. 
                         If we win the suit, better. You do 
                         me an injustice.
                              (He moves over to her 
                              table, leaving the 
                              soup at his table)
                         When we went to my apartment did I 
                         have the slightest idea that you had 
                         any connection with this deal?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         But you have now, and I know now 
                         that you are a man who employs 
                         business methods which in Russia 
                         would be punished by death.

                                     LEON
                         Death! Death! Always so glum! What 
                         about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians 
                         never think of life? Of the moment 
                         in which we are living? The only 
                         moment we really have? Don't take it 
                         all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing 
                         is worth it. Please... relax... I 
                         beg you, Sergeant... smile!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (astonished)
                         What?

                                     LEON
                         Will you smile?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Why?

                                     LEON
                         Just smile.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         At what?

                                     LEON
                         At anything. At the whole ludicrous 
                         spectacle of life. At people being 
                         pompous and taking themselves 
                         seriously and exaggerating their own 
                         importance. If you can't find anything 
                         else to laugh at you can laugh at 
                         you and me.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Why?

                                     LEON
                         Because we are an odd couple.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Then you should go back to your table.

                                     LEON
                         No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not 
                         yet. Not until I've made you laugh... 
                         at least once.

               To get rid of him Ninotchka emits a joyless sound which 
               approximates a laugh.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Ha! Ha! Now go back.

                                     LEON
                         That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh 
                         from the heart. Now let's see. I'm 
                         going to tell you a funny story. 
                         Just a moment... I've got it! Well, 
                         it seems there were a couple of 
                         Frenchmen who went to America...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         On which boat?

                                     LEON
                              (thrown off by her 
                              methodical thinking)
                         Well, er... let's drop it. I don't 
                         think you would care for that one.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Probably not.

                                     LEON
                         Do you like Scotch stories?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I have never heard one.

                                     LEON
                         Two Scotchmen met on the street... 
                         and I don't know the name of the 
                         street and it really doesn't matter. 
                         Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh 
                         and the other's was McGillicuddy. 
                         McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, 
                         Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy 
                         says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. 
                         McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to 
                         McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. 
                         McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy 
                         says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. 
                         McIntosh?"...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I wish they had never met.

                                     LEON
                              (disarmed)
                         So do I.
                              (after a little pause)
                         Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! 
                         Ha!
                              (he looks at Ninotchka 
                              and her expression 
                              stops him)
                         Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's 
                         forget it! How's this? Two men are 
                         looking at the moon. One says to the 
                         other, "Is it true that a lot of 
                         people live on the moon?" "Yes, it 
                         is," says the other, "five hundred 
                         million." "Whew!" replies the first, 
                         "they must get pretty crowded when 
                         it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!

               There is no response from Ninotchka.

                                     LEON
                              (starting to get sore)
                         I suppose you don't think that's 
                         funny?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No.

                                     LEON
                         It seemed funny to me when I first 
                         heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't 
                         with the joke. Maybe it's with you!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I don't think so.

                                     LEON
                         Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. 
                         Well, I'll give you one more chance! 
                         Now listen!

               He gets up and speaks in a threatening voice audible to the 
               entire room.

                                     LEON
                         When I heard this joke for the first 
                         time I laughed myself sick. Here 
                         goes! A man comes into a restaurant 
                         and sits down and says, "Waiter! Get 
                         me a cup of coffee without cream." 
                         After five minutes the waiter comes 
                         back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we're 
                         all out of cream, can it be without 
                         milk?"

               GROUP OF SEVERAL WORKMEN

               They have overheard the story and all burst into laughter.

               NINOTCHKA AND LEON

               Ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a 
               laugh.

                                     LEON
                              (furious)
                         Not funny, huh?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No.

                                     LEON
                         So you don't think that's funny? It 
                         is funny! Everyone else thinks so! 
                         Maybe you didn't get it.

               He sits down again.

                                     LEON
                              (threateningly)
                         I'll tell you that joke again. A man 
                         comes into a restaurant. Did you get 
                         that?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes.

                                     LEON
                         He sits down at the table and says 
                         to the waiter... Did you get that 
                         too?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes.

                                     LEON
                         Well, so far it isn't funny, but 
                         wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! 
                         Bring me a cup of coffee." So the 
                         waiter comes back five minutes later 
                         and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have 
                         no coffee."...
                              (he realizes he has 
                              made a mistake)
                         Wait a minute... wait a minute... 
                         I'm all mixed up...
                              (he starts over again)
                         A man comes in a restaurant, he sits 
                         down, he calls the waiter and he 
                         says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee 
                         without cream," and five minutes 
                         later the waiter comes back and says, 
                         "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, 
                         can it be a glass of milk!"

               He gets up and goes over to his table furiously.

                                     LEON
                         Ah! You have no sense of humor! That 
                         settles it! You have no sense of 
                         humor! None! No humor!!

               In his excitement he leans on the shaky table. It topples 
               forward. Simultaneously his feet shoot from under him and he 
               sits violently on the floor, the contents of the table 
               crashing about him, hot soup in his face.

               A terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is 
               rocking with laughter.

               For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the 
               irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself 
               roars with laughter.

                                     LEON
                              (indignantly)
                         What's funny about this?

               Ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable.

               After a moment Leon gets up and sits next to her. As he dries 
               himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation 
               and starts to howl with laughter too. The ice is broken at 
               last!

               On their mutual wild hilarity, we

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               LIVING ROOM -- ROYAL SUITE

               FADE IN:

               A conference is in session -- Ninotchka, her two Lawyers, 
               and the Three Russians. Ninotchka sits at the desk, leaning 
               back in the chair, looking into space, and apparently weighing 
               every point which is brought up. One of the lawyers is reading 
               from a document.

                                     LAWYER
                              (reading)
                         In addition to the arguments above 
                         enumerated for lifting this 
                         injunction, we wish to cite the 
                         decision of the High Court of Paris, 
                         rendered in the case of Princess 
                         Marishka against the Government of 
                         Montenegro on the fifth day of August, 
                         1897. Comparing the facts in that 
                         case with our present set of facts 
                         we feel that the Treaty between the 
                         Republic of France and the U.S.S.R. 
                         should prevail over all...

               Suddenly Ninotchka laughs. Everyone looks at her astonished. 
               Ninotchka gets up.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day 
                         I heard such a funny story...
                              (she laughs again)
                         It still makes me laugh. It is very 
                         funny.
                              (a little embarrassed)
                         I am sorry. Oh yes... about this 
                         injunction...

                                     LAWYER
                              (very businesslike)
                         The hearing is set for the twentieth 
                         of this month.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (not thinking of the 
                              injunction)
                         That's two weeks from Thursday...

                                     LAWYER
                         We did our utmost to have it set 
                         ahead.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (her attitude 
                              completely different 
                              from her former 
                              business conferences)
                         I know, gentlemen, but it is in the 
                         hands of the Court. We're helpless, 
                         aren't we?

                                     LAWYER
                         Yes. It is unfortunate.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Well, there's nothing we can do about 
                         it. Why get excited?

               The Three Russians as well as the Lawyers are puzzled.

               The Russians exchange hopeful glances.

                                     LAWYER
                         We'll leave these papers here for 
                         your further consideration. Au revoir, 
                         madame.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Au revoir.

               The Lawyers leave.

               Left alone with the Russians, Ninotchka is unable to conceal 
               her happiness entirely.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Well, it means another two weeks in 
                         Paris.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (with exaggerated 
                              efficiency)
                         Too bad we have to waste all that 
                         time.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         I acted on your suggestion and got 
                         in touch with the Power and Light 
                         authorities. Whenever you want to 
                         visit their plants they are open to 
                         you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (a little bit dreamily)
                         Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         There's something else which I know 
                         will appeal to you. A visit to the 
                         Paris sewers. They tell me it is 
                         extremely instructive.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, 
                         Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, 
                         Comrades. And why do we always keep 
                         the windows closed?
                              (she opens the window)
                         Isn't it amazing, at home there's 
                         still snow and ice and here... Look 
                         at the birds. I always felt a little 
                         hurt that our swallows deserted us 
                         in the winter for capitalistic 
                         countries. Now I know why. We have 
                         the high ideal but they have the 
                         climate... well, Comrades, I don't 
                         think I need you any more.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         If there is anything we can do for 
                         you...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No, not a thing. Would you like to 
                         go out?

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         Thank you, Comrade.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Have you any money?

               The Russians stammer a negative answer.

               Smiling benevolently, Ninotchka goes to the table, takes 
               several bills from her handbag, and goes back, extending a 
               fifty-franc bill to Kopalski.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Well, here are fifty francs.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                              (overwhelmed)
                         Thank you, Comrade, thank you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Bring me forty-five back.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                              (terribly disappointed)
                         Naturally, Comrade.

               The Three Russians leave. Ninotchka waits a moment. Then 
               hurries to the door and turns the key. Camera follows her as 
               she goes into the bedroom. She proceeds to the door leading 
               to the corridor and turns its key. She goes to the table and 
               takes a little key from her handbag, goes to the bureau and 
               unlocks the drawer, opens it, and, just as she is about to 
               take out something, her eye falls on the night table, where 
               she sees the picture of Lenin which she brought with her 
               from Moscow. She walks over to it and turns its face against 
               the wall, then goes back to the bureau and takes from the 
               drawer the very hat which twice aroused her disapproval when 
               it was displayed in the millinery shop in the lobby.

               She moves over to the large mirror, puts the hat on her head, 
               is uncertain whether it is right side to fore, and changes 
               it. She looks at herself, aghast at seeing a complete 
               stranger. She sits down, still staring in the mirror, then 
               leans forward and rests her chin on her hand. As she sits 
               studying the new Ninotchka suspiciously, we

               LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               It is evening. Leon is walking nervously up and down. Gaston 
               is puttering over the drink table.

                                     LEON
                              (consulting his watch)
                         What time have you, Gaston?

                                     GASTON
                         Eight forty-two, sir.

                                     LEON
                         I guess it is eight forty-two.

                                     GASTON
                         You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.

                                     LEON
                         I am, Gaston.

                                     GASTON
                         If you will forgive me, ever since 
                         you met that Bolshevik lady I've 
                         noticed a distinct change in you, 
                         sir.

                                     LEON
                              (complacently)
                         Have you?

                                     GASTON
                         Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly 
                         amazed when I came from the market 
                         and found that you had made your 
                         bed, sir.

                                     LEON
                         And Gaston, I was happier all day 
                         long. I felt I'd contributed 
                         something.

                                     GASTON
                         Well, sir, if you should do it again, 
                         which I hope you won't, please 
                         remember the order. Counterpane, 
                         blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.

                                     LEON
                         Ah, there's something poetic about 
                         the simple processes of labor. 
                         Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, 
                         sheet... it should be set to music!

                                     GASTON
                         May I add, sir, that it was with 
                         great amazement that I found a copy 
                         of Karl Marx's Capital on your night 
                         table. That is a socialistic volume 
                         which I refuse to so much as dust, 
                         sir. I view with alarm, sir, the 
                         influence over you of this Bolshevik 
                         lady.

                                     LEON
                         I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it 
                         about time that you realized the 
                         unfairness of your position? You 
                         being my servant? Wouldn't you like 
                         to stand on an equal footing with 
                         me?

                                     GASTON
                         No, sir.

                                     LEON
                         Isn't there any revolt in you? 
                         Sometimes when I order you around 
                         don't you feel like kicking me in 
                         the pants?

                                     GASTON
                              (emphatically)
                         No, sir.

                                     LEON
                         Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you 
                         look forward to the day when you can 
                         come in here and stand square on 
                         your two feet and say, "Hey, you, 
                         d'Algout! from now on it's going to 
                         be share and share alike"?

                                     GASTON
                              (outraged)
                         Emphatically not, sir. The prospect 
                         terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand 
                         me, sir, I don't resent your not 
                         paying me for the past two months, 
                         but the thought that I should split 
                         my bank account with you... that you 
                         should take half of my life's 
                         savings... that is really too much 
                         for me.

               The door bell rings. Gaston starts for the door. With a 
               gesture Leon stops him.

                                     LEON
                         Go to bed, little father, go to bed.

               Gaston leaves through the other door as Leon exits toward 
               the entrance hall.

               ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT

               Leon enters the scene. He opens the door. Outside stands 
               Ninotchka wearing her new hat timidly as well as a completely 
               new outfit which she has bought, apparently to match the new 
               hat. It takes Leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor. 
               He takes her hand and leads her in, closing the door. He 
               looks at her again and kisses her hand.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I don't look too foolish?

                                     LEON
                         Foolish? If this dress were to walk 
                         down the boulevard all by itself I 
                         would follow it from one end of Paris 
                         to the other, and when I caught up 
                         with it I would say, "Just a moment, 
                         you charming little dress, I want 
                         you to meet Ninotchka... you two 
                         were meant for each other." Ninotchka 
                         feels more comfortable.

               Leon leads her into the living room.

               LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

               They both enter. Ninotchka pauses a second and looks around.

                                     LEON
                         You remember this room?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I've never been here before. I wonder 
                         whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, 
                         a girl with a map, figuring out each 
                         step, worrying about north and south. 
                         Today... now this might shock you... 
                         I went up to a taxi and said "Eight 
                         Rue du Bois"... and here I am.

                                     LEON
                         You see? Life can be so simple.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         For twelve francs, seventy-five.

                                     LEON
                         Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? 
                         The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...
                              (charmingly)
                         But he got you here.

               At this moment the clock starts to strike. They both look 
               toward it.

               INSERT -- CLOCK

               The hands register nine o'clock.

               LEON AND NINOTCHKA

               Leon wants to take her in his arms. She resists a little.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (reprimanding him)
                         It's nine o'clock.

                                     LEON
                         That's when one half of Paris says 
                         to the other half, "What are your 
                         plans for this evening, madame?"

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (getting more and 
                              more in the spirit 
                              of her change of 
                              appearance)
                         Well, first I should like to take 
                         off my hat and jacket.
                              (Leon takes them)
                         Then could we have some music?

                                     LEON
                         A wonderful idea! Radio or records?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Not radio. Let's have music that's 
                         just for ourselves.

               Leon turns on the victrola.

                                     LEON
                              (with great feeling 
                              and sincerity)
                         I'll play it softly because I have 
                         things to tell you about which I 
                         can't shout.

               He walks back to Ninotchka, who by now is seated in an 
               armchair. He sits on the arm of the chair. He tries to make 
               a declaration of his love. He stammers several words.

                                     LEON
                         Well, my darling... I... we...

               It is no use. In a sudden outburst of emotion he takes her 
               in his arms and kisses her.

                                     LEON
                              (as they come out of 
                              the kiss)
                         You see I couldn't shout that.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (with great feeling)
                         Leon, you know the jokes you told me 
                         a few days ago? I wake up in the 
                         middle of the night and laugh at 
                         them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know 
                         they're not funny, they're silly. 
                         They're stupid. And still... I 
                         laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff 
                         and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they 
                         are scoundrels and I should hate 
                         them -- then I realize who made them 
                         like that, and instead of sending my 
                         report to Moscow I tear it up and go 
                         down and buy a ridiculous hat... and 
                         if this keeps on... am I too 
                         talkative?

                                     LEON
                              (radiantly)
                         No... go on.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Leon, I want to tell you something 
                         which I thought I never would say, 
                         which I thought nobody ever should 
                         say, because I thought it didn't 
                         exist... and, Leon... I can't say 
                         it...

               They kiss again. As the kiss ends they look at each other 
               for a second.

               Ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk 
               chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from 
               it a little mirror and a lipstick. Before she uses it she 
               looks at Leon with guilty happiness. Leon looks at her with 
               great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking 
               at her as she makes up her lips.

                                     LEON
                         What a gesture for a sergeant.

               As soon as she is finished, Ninotchka slips the mirror and 
               lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances 
               at the top of the desk.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Leon, I would like to ask you 
                         something.

                                     LEON
                         Anything, Ninotchka.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         If you don't want to answer, you 
                         needn't. But if you do, you must 
                         tell me the truth.

                                     LEON
                         I promise... I swear.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (seriously)
                         Did you make any change in this room?

                                     LEON
                         I don't think so.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         When I was here before I noticed a 
                         photograph of a woman on the desk in 
                         a wide silver frame. I thought what 
                         a waste of silver. That's all that 
                         interested me then. Now I would like 
                         to know... what happened to the woman?

               Leon too is completely serious by now. For answer he quietly 
               opens the drawer of the desk. Ninotchka looks in and takes 
               from the drawer the photograph. As she looks at it she rises.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         The Duchess.

               Leon nods gravely.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (looking at the picture)
                         She is very attractive. She has great 
                         elegance.
                              (she looks back at 
                              Leon)
                         She's what you call a woman of the 
                         world, isn't she?

                                     LEON
                              (after a little pause)
                         Ninotchka, I love you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I suppose she is very entertaining... 
                         It must be lots of fun to be with 
                         her, so witty, so glamorous...

                                     LEON
                         Ninotchka, you're jealous.

               Ninotchka nods sadly.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (with great feeling)
                         Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture 
                         of myself... I couldn't bear the 
                         thought of being shut up in a 
                         drawer... I couldn't breathe, I 
                         couldn't stand it.

                                     LEON
                         My darling.

               As he takes her in his arms, we

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INTERIOR, SMART NIGHT CLUB

               FADE IN:

               Duchess Swana enters with a party consisting of General 
               Savitzky and five other smartly dressed people of the world. 
               The Headwaiter hurries to greet Swana.

                                     HEADWAITER
                         Good evening, Your Highness.

                                     SWANA
                         Good evening, Louis. You seem to be 
                         very crowded tonight. Can you manage 
                         a table near the floor?

                                     HEADWAITER
                         Certainly, Your Highness, this way 
                         please... Count d'Algout made the 
                         reservation this afternoon.

                                     SWANA
                              (puzzled)
                         Count d'Algout...

                                     HEADWAITER
                         It is only a small table but it will 
                         be no trouble to put in some extra 
                         chairs.

               Swana has grasped the situation by now.

                                     SWANA
                         No, that's another party.

               In order to save the situation one of the ladies makes a 
               suggestion.

                                     LADY
                         Why don't we go some other place? 
                         It's so crowded here.

                                     SWANA
                              (delighted at her 
                              luck)
                         No, no! This is glory! At last I'm 
                         going to have a look at that female 
                         Bolshevik. Can you give us another 
                         table?

                                     HEADWAITER
                         Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.

                                     SWANA
                         That's perfect!

               Camera moves with the group as the Headwaiter leads it toward 
               a table.

                                     ANOTHER WOMAN GUEST
                         You mean Leon's bringing the Bolshevik 
                         you told us about?

                                     SWANA
                         Isn't it divine?

                                     ANOTHER GUEST
                         I wouldn't have missed this for the 
                         world.

                                     SWANA
                              (very gay, in 
                              anticipation of a 
                              triumph)
                         Now, we must be very discreet. If 
                         she sucks her soup and drinks out of 
                         her finger bowl, I don't want anyone 
                         to laugh.
                              (everybody in the 
                              party giggles)
                         We must not embarrass little Leon. 
                         He is going through enough for my 
                         sake. We mustn't add insult to injury

               By now they have reached the table in the rear.

                                     HEADWAITER
                         Is this satisfactory?

                                     SWANA
                         Thank you, Louis.

               They sit down. The Headwaiter bends over General Savitzky, 
               an elderly Russian aristocrat, who sits next to Swana.

                                     HEADWAITER
                         Is it to be dinner, monsieur?

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         Possibly later. We'll just start 
                         with champagne.

                                     SWANA
                              (to the party)
                         I'm only afraid that the doorman may 
                         spoil our fun. If only he lets her 
                         in!

               Swana laughs and everyone joins in her laughter.

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         Your Highness...

                                     SWANA
                         Yes, General Savitzky?

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         I want you to know all the White 
                         Russian exiles in Paris are keeping 
                         their fingers crossed about the 
                         jewels. They are very interested in 
                         the case. Swana suspects her 
                         countrymen.

                                     SWANA
                         Are they indeed? Thank you.

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         They hope the settlement will bring 
                         you a fortune.

                                     SWANA
                         General, please... if you hear any 
                         rumors that I am a charitable person, 
                         will you please kill them at their 
                         source?

               As she is lighting a cigarette a guest suddenly looks toward 
               the entrance and sees Leon.

                                     GUEST
                         Look! There's Leon!

               Joyfully Swana looks toward the entrance, as does everyone 
               else at the table.

                                     EVERYONE AT THE TABLE
                         Oh yes! Where? There! Oh! How 
                         exciting!

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AT THE ENTRANCE

               Suddenly, through the door of the cloakroom comes Ninotchka, 
               radiant in a beautiful evening gown.

               SWANA'S TABLE

               Swana's expression freezes as she sees Ninotchka. The rest 
               of the guests stare in an embarrassed silence, save for one 
               bird-brained little guest, named Marianne, who feels it her 
               mission to save the situation.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Isn't she something?

               A neighbor nudges her warningly. Swana withers her with a 
               glance and rises.

                                     SWANA
                         Shall we dance, General Savitzky?

               Swana and the General leave for the dance floor. The guest 
               who has nudged her turns to Marianne.

                                     GUEST
                         Are you crazy?

                                     ANOTHER GUEST
                         How could you make such a remark?

                                     THIRD GUEST
                         Swana isn't stupid.

                                     MARIANNE
                         What did I say? I just said "isn't 
                         she something?" I didn't say something 
                         what.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S TABLE

               Leon and Ninotchka are seated and a Waiter stands by them 
               presenting a bottle of champagne to Leon for his approval.

                                     LEON
                              (to Waiter)
                         Is it dry?

                                     WAITER
                         Yes, monsieur.

                                     LEON
                              (to Ninotchka)
                         Is that right or do you prefer it 
                         sweet?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I wouldn't know. The closest I ever 
                         came to champagne was in a newsreel. 
                         The wife of some president was 
                         throwing it at a battleship.

                                     LEON
                         It's always good luck to launch 
                         something with champagne; a 
                         battleship... or an evening.

               By now the Waiter is filling their glasses. Ninotchka lifts 
               her glass and looks at it.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It's funny to look back. I was brought 
                         up on goat's milk, I had a ration of 
                         vodka in the army, and now champagne.

                                     LEON
                              (gaily)
                         From goats to grapes. That's drinking 
                         in the right direction.

               Ninotchka takes her first sip of champagne. Leon drinks and 
               watches her. The first sip proves a painful surprise. 
               Ninotchka's face is that of a child who has been fed a bad 
               medicine.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Ugh... um... oh...
                              (slowly the delight 
                              of champagne dawns 
                              on her and her face 
                              breaks into a smile)
                         It's good.

               She drinks the whole glass at once. Leon looks at her in 
               amused surprise. He drinks too. The Waiter fills their glasses 
               again.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         From what I read I thought champagne 
                         was a strong drink. It's very 
                         delicate. Do people ever get drunk 
                         on this?

                                     LEON
                         There have been cases... but the 
                         headache the next morning is worth 
                         while -- if you drink it with the 
                         right toast.
                              (he raises his glass 
                              again fondly)
                         To us, Ninotchka!

               They clink glasses and drink again, looking at each other.

               LONG SHOT OF THE TABLE, including part of the dance floor.

               As Leon and Ninotchka lift their glasses again, Swana and 
               General Savitzky start to dance by the table. Swana stops, 
               pretending complete astonishment.

                                     SWANA
                         Hello, Leon! What a surprise! You of 
                         all people! How are you, my dear?

               Leon gets up. Ninotchka watches the scene tensely.

                                     LEON
                              (embarrassed)
                         Hello, Swana. How do you do, General 
                         Savitzky?

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         How do you do?

                                     SWANA
                              (to Leon)
                         You're looking magnificent, Leon...
                              (to General Savitzky)
                         ...isn't he, General Savitzky?

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         Yes.

               Leon knows that Swana wants to embarrass him but is 
               embarrassed nevertheless.

                                     LEON
                         Thank you.

                                     SWANA
                         Is this your new dress suit?

                                     LEON
                         Yes, Swana.

                                     SWANA
                         Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson 
                         were the tailors for you?

                                     LEON
                              (patiently)
                         Yes, Swana, you did.

                                     SWANA
                         It's a dream of beauty. He never 
                         takes my word for anything, but I 
                         was right, wasn't I?

                                     LEON
                         Yes, Swana.

                                     SWANA
                              (forcing an 
                              introduction)
                         Am I interrupting?

                                     LEON
                         Not at all. Your Highness, may I 
                         present Madame Yakushova?

                                     SWANA
                         How do you do?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         How do you do?

                                     LEON
                         And General Savitzky.

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         How do you do?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         How do you do?

                                     SWANA
                         I've some wonderful news for you, 
                         Leon. It's about Punchy... do you 
                         mind if I sit down?

                                     LEON
                              (realizing that he 
                              cannot prevent it)
                         No... please...

               Swana sits down.

                                     SWANA
                              (to General Savitzky)
                         General, would you mind making my 
                         excuses at our table? I'll be back 
                         in a few moments.

                                     GENERAL SAVITZKY
                         Certainly.

               He bows and leaves.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALL THREE SITTING AT THE TABLE

                                     SWANA
                         Well, Leon, we can be proud of our 
                         Punchy. He had a triumph at the dog 
                         show.

               During the following speech, Ninotchka's expression does not 
               change. She knows exactly the game Swana is playing.

                                     SWANA
                              (continuing)
                         He won another blue ribbon and bit 
                         the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him 
                         the cutest sweater as a reward. You 
                         should see him strut down the street 
                         in it. He looks like a little 
                         boulevardier.
                              (to Ninotchka)
                         You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy 
                         for my birthday.
                              (to Leon)
                         You must have searched weeks before 
                         you found anything as divine as 
                         Punchy, didn't you, Leon?

                                     LEON
                              (fed up with Swana's 
                              tactics)
                         Months, Swana.

                                     SWANA
                              (to Ninotchka)
                         Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are 
                         talking in mysteries.... I'm sure 
                         you wonder what it's all about.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (dry and direct)
                         Not at all.... I understand perfectly, 
                         Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You 
                         made it very clear, madame.

                                     SWANA
                         Dear me... I must be losing my 
                         finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be 
                         understood by everybody.

                                     LEON
                              (acutely uncomfortable)
                         There's a charming crowd here tonight, 
                         isn't there?

                                     SWANA
                         I'm going, Leon...
                              (she rises, as does 
                              Leon, delighted to 
                              get rid of her)
                         but before I leave I must compliment 
                         you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. 
                         Is that what they're wearing in Moscow 
                         this year?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No, last year, madame.

               Swana sits again, as does Leon.

                                     SWANA
                         Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong 
                         impression of the new Russia.
                              (cynically)
                         It must be charming. I'm glad 
                         conditions are so improved. I assume 
                         this is what the factory workers 
                         wear at their dances?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Exactly. You see, it would have been 
                         embarrassing for people of my sort 
                         to wear low-cut gowns in the old 
                         Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks 
                         across our backs were not very 
                         becoming, and you know how vain women 
                         are.

                                     SWANA
                         You're absolutely right about the 
                         Cossacks. We made an unpardonable 
                         mistake when we let them use their 
                         knouts. They had such reliable guns.

               Leon has grown more and more uncomfortable as the two ladies 
               fence.

                                     LEON
                         Will you do me a favor? Stop talking 
                         about the good old days.

                                     SWANA
                         A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm 
                         afraid madame and I will never agree.
                              (she plays her trump 
                              card)
                         The only thing we have in common is 
                         our lawsuit and that will be decided 
                         next week. I understand everything 
                         will be over by Thursday. Am I right?

               Ninotchka and Leon realize the malice and yet the truth of 
               her words.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You're right, madame, it will all be 
                         over by Thursday.

                                     SWANA
                              (rubbing it in)
                         It is unfortunate that you have so 
                         few more days in Paris.
                              (she turns to Leon)
                         Be sure and redouble your efforts so 
                         that madame can take some pleasant 
                         memories when she returns to Moscow.
                              (she rises, Leon rising 
                              too)
                         Good night.
                              (Ninotchka nods without 
                              answering. To Leon)
                         Good night, Leon.

                                     LEON
                              (coldly)
                         Good night, Swana.

               Swana leaves the table. Leon sits again. The mood of the two 
               has been changed by the problem of their separation, which 
               has been brought before them. They sit in silence for a 
               moment. Ninotchka speaks first.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Now I think I need a glass of 
                         champagne.

               Leon fills their glasses. They drink. Then Leon takes 
               Ninotchka's hand.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (trying to break the 
                              mood)
                         Quickly, please... tell me one of 
                         your funny stories.

                                     LEON
                         A funny story?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You never finished the one about the 
                         two Scotchmen with the names.

                                     LEON
                         Well, there were two Scotchmen. One 
                         was named McIntosh and one was named 
                         McGillicuddy. They met on the street.

               He stops.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Go on.

                                     LEON
                         No, darling. I'll tell you another 
                         story, a much better one.
                              (with deep sincerity)
                         The only thing that will be over on 
                         Thursday is the lawsuit. There will 
                         be no Thursday for us. Not next week 
                         or any week. We won't let it happen. 
                         I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is 
                         that a good story?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (touched)
                         Wonderful -- if one could believe 
                         it.

                                     LEON
                         You must, darling.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (lifting her glass)
                         To the loveliest story I ever heard.

               They drink. The orchestra starts a number.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (afraid of where the 
                              conversation may 
                              lead)
                         Shall we dance?

               They both start toward the dance floor.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA, DANCING A WALTZ

               At the second turn Ninotchka starts to feel the effect of 
               the champagne.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (tipsily)
                         Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.

                                     LEON
                         You just made that trip from goats 
                         to grapes a little too fast.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's 
                         getting farther and farther away!

                                     LEON
                         What, darling?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thursday.

                                     LEON
                         Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be 
                         all right.

               In the gayest mood, Ninotchka addresses the crowd on the 
               dance floor.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Comrades! Comrades!

                                     LEON
                              (embarrassed)
                         Darling, darling... please!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I must talk to my brothers!

                                     LEON
                         Shhh! Shhh!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Don't shush me. I am People! I want 
                         to make a speech. I want to overthrow 
                         the Duchess!

               Leon starts to lead her off the dance floor.

                                     LEON
                         But, darling, you can't do that.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Comrades! Good people of France!

                                     LEON
                         Now, Ninotchka... please!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         They are all Duchesses here... 
                         thousands of Duchesses... and I am 
                         going to tell them.

               By now they have almost reached the powder room.

                                     LEON
                         Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but 
                         first you're going in that door and 
                         you're going to take a little spirits 
                         of ammonia and lie down.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (sweetly)
                         No speech?

                                     LEON
                              (as though he were 
                              addressing a little 
                              child)
                         No speech.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I love you, my little Leonitchka!

                                     LEON
                         And I adore you, Ninotchua.

               Ninotchka goes unsteadily into the powder room. Leon wipes 
               his forehead in relief and goes to the bar, followed by the 
               CAMERA.

                                     LEON
                              (to the bartender)
                         Give me a double brandy.

               CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR OF THE POWDER ROOM

               A group of four to six women come out whispering excitedly 
               about something which must have happened within.

               CAMERA goes with them as they go to the Manager of the 
               restaurant and crowd about him and whisper what has happened.

               CLOSE SHOT -- BAR

               The bartender gives Leon his double brandy and Leon tosses 
               it off. The Manager comes into the shot and addresses Leon.

                                     MANAGER
                              (very excitedly)
                         I'm very sorry, Count d'Algout, it 
                         is most embarrassing, but the lady 
                         you brought with you tonight is 
                         spreading communistic propaganda in 
                         the powder room.

               Leon stares at him for a second, then turns to the bartender.

                                     LEON
                         Give me another double brandy.

                                     MANAGER
                         That kind of propaganda is bad 
                         anywhere, but inciting the attendants 
                         of a powder room to go on strike.... 
                         Well, if she succeeds the consequences 
                         will be disastrous.

                                     LEON
                         What can I do about it?

                                     MANAGER
                         She has been asked to leave the powder 
                         room but without success. We would 
                         appreciate if you would see to it 
                         yourself.

                                     LEON
                              (horrified)
                         You want me to go in there?

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

               The Manager bows and walks away. Leon gulps down the second 
               double brandy. The CAMERA follows him as he proceeds toward 
               the powder room like a hero going into battle. Just as he is 
               about to enter, a very dignified elderly lady comes out, is 
               surprised at his attempted entrance, and glares at him. Leon 
               loses his courage and FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA goes back to 
               the bar to strengthen it with some of the Dutch variety.

                                     LEON
                              (completely exhausted -- 
                              to the bartender)
                         Make it a triple brandy. As we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LIVING ROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE

               Rakonin, the waiter, opens the door. Ninotchka and Leon, 
               both very tipsy by now, enter the room. Leon is carrying a 
               bottle of champagne in a napkin. As he passes the waiter he 
               speaks:

                                     LEON
                              (to Rakonin)
                         All right... you can tell the 
                         Duchess... you can tell everybody... 
                         they know anyhow... it doesn't make 
                         any difference... now get out!

               Rakonin, who seems very interested in the situation, closes 
               the door.

               Leon goes to Ninotchka. Both sit on a couch.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (moving close to him)
                         Don't tell them where we're going, 
                         sweetheart.

                                     LEON
                         No. Nobody will find us.

               Ninotchka is lyrically tight. Through her there shines a 
               great happiness.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Are we going to build our little 
                         house?

                                     LEON
                         Yes... a little white house.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Not white, darling.

                                     LEON
                         All right, we'll make it red.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No, don't let's have it any color... 
                         no color... just a house house... 
                         let's form our own party.

                                     LEON
                         Right: Lovers of the world unite!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (delighted)
                         And we won't stretch up our arms...

                                     LEON
                         No! No!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         ...and we won't clench our fist...

                                     LEON
                         No! No!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (tenderly)
                         Our salute will be a kiss.

                                     LEON
                         Yes... a kiss... salute!

               She sinks into his arms and they kiss.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (still in his arms)
                         I am so happy. No one can be so happy 
                         without being punished. I will be 
                         punished and I should be punished.
                              (she gets up)
                         I want to confess, darling.

                                     LEON
                         I know... it's the Russian soul.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (her gaiety mixed 
                              with sadness)
                         Everyone wants to confess and if 
                         they don't confess they make them 
                         confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed 
                         you I betrayed the Russian ideal. 
                         Leon, I should be stood up against 
                         the wall.

               Leon gets up.

                                     LEON
                              (sympathetically)
                         Would that make you any happier?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Much happier.

                                     LEON
                         All right.

               Still carrying the champagne bottle, Leon leads her to the 
               end of the room and stands her against the wall. He takes 
               the napkin from the champagne bottle and puts it over her 
               eyes. The CAMERA moves with him as he goes away from 
               Ninotchka, and as he walks he starts to open the champagne. 
               The cork pops.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, as she sinks gently into a chair.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (happily)
                         I have paid the penalty. Now let's 
                         have some music.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND LEON

                                     LEON
                         Let's turn on the radio.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Radio! What is radio?

                                     LEON
                         It's a little box that you buy on 
                         the installment plan and before you 
                         tune it in they tell you they have a 
                         new model.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (getting up)
                         Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob 
                         that turns... a little knob... it 
                         must be somewhere around here... 
                         yes... here... I see...

               Confusedly Ninotchka starts looking for something, repeating, 
               "a little knob... a little knob." Followed by Leon she goes 
               toward the safe, opens the concealing door, and both are 
               delighted as they see the safe's dial.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (triumphantly)
                         Here it is!

               Leon nods approval and starts to turn the dial.

                                     LEON
                         What shall we get? The news!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No, no news. We don't want to know 
                         what's happening in the world. We 
                         want to be left alone, don't we?

                                     LEON
                         Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (remembering vaguely)
                         Well, then we turn twice to the right 
                         and stop at seven...

               Leon follows her instructions.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (after a little pause, 
                              sadly)
                         It's dead.

                                     LEON
                         Well, it has to warm up... you have 
                         to give it a chance... just like 
                         people... like you and me... first 
                         you wanted to fight me and now we 
                         belong to the same party... salute!

               He takes her in his arms and again they embrace.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (as though she were 
                              in heaven)
                         Now twice to the left and stop at 
                         seventeen.

               Leon again follows her instructions.

               INTERIOR -- SAFE, shooting toward the door.

               Leon opens the door and both look into the safe.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (disappointed)
                         No music.

                                     LEON
                              (also disappointed)
                         No, no music.

               Through her fog, Ninotchka becomes aware of the case 
               containing the jewels.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (bitterly)
                         There it is... Thursday... you can't 
                         rip it out of the week....

                                     LEON
                              (helpfully)
                         But I can throw it out of the window.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (philosophically)
                         It wouldn't be fair to the man in 
                         the street.
                              (she pushes back the 
                              lid)
                         There they are... they are terrible 
                         things, those jewels....

                                     LEON
                         ...but big.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         ...they are the tears of Old Russia... 
                         see that stone?

                                     LEON
                         Who cried that one?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Czar Peter gave it to his wife, 
                         Catherine the Great. For it he sold 
                         ten thousand serfs in the market.

                                     LEON
                         Now, darling, don't get impatient, 
                         wait until we are married. You know 
                         that worthless butler of mine... 
                         that reactionary? Some day when I 
                         come home to you I may say, "Darling, 
                         I drove Gaston to the market and 
                         look what I got from him!"

               From the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds 
               it in front of her.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (the economist now)
                         First ten thousand serfs... now just 
                         Gaston. It is very encouraging.

               Leon takes her by the hand and leads her from the safe.

                                     LEON
                         Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on 
                         you. You will teach these jewels. 
                         For the first time they will learn 
                         how they can look.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         They belong to the people.

                                     LEON
                              (in a ceremonial voice)
                         I give them back to the people...
                              (as formal and steady 
                              as possible under 
                              the conditions he 
                              puts the diadem on 
                              her head)
                         I make you Ninotchka the Great... 
                         Duchess of the People!... Grand 
                         Duchess of the People!

               Ninotchka falls in with the spirit of this imaginary 
               coronation.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Is this the wish of the masses?

                                     LEON
                         It is their wish.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.
                              (in a low voice)
                         Can I make a speech now?

                                     LEON
                         Please.

               Ninotchka turns to an imaginary assemblage.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Comrades! People of the world! The 
                         revolution is on the march... I 
                         know... wars will wash over us... 
                         bombs will fall... all civilization 
                         will crumble... but not yet, please... 
                         wait, wait... what's the hurry?
                              (mixing reality with 
                              fantasy)
                         Let us be happy... give us our 
                         moment....
                              (turning to Leon)
                         We are happy, aren't we, Leon?

                                     LEON
                              (fondly)
                         Yes, sweetheart.
                              (he holds her in his 
                              arms)

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (her voice getting 
                              dimmer and dimmer)
                         So happy and so tired.

               She falls asleep in his arms. Leon gathers her up and carries 
               her into the bedroom, the diadem still on her head.

               BEDROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE

               Leon carries Ninotchka to the bed, puts her down on it. She 
               is now sleeping soundly. He kisses her once more and then 
               turns, the CAMERA PANNING with him, and starts toward the 
               door to the corridor and exits. As he closes the door with 
               an uncertain hand, it slams.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, as she lies on the bed

               On the night table beside her is a photograph of the stern-
               faced Lenin. The crash of the slamming door awakens Ninotchka 
               for a moment. Completely content and happy, she turns around 
               and sees the disapproving face of the photograph.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (charmingly)
                         Smile, little father, smile.

               INSERT OF PHOTOGRAPH OF LENIN

               The photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS -- DAY

               FADE IN ON:

               IN THE FOREGROUND a clock shows that it is a quarter to 
               twelve.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM OF THE ROYAL SUITE

               It is taken from an ANGLE which includes the door. The lights 
               are still on, the curtains drawn, the empty champagne bottle 
               and glasses litter the room. We hear the buzzer of the 
               corridor door ring several times without an answer.

               CAMERA moves through the door into the bedroom, never 
               disclosing the bed. The lights in the bedroom are still 
               lighted also and the curtains drawn. CAMERA stops on the 
               door from the bedroom to the corridor. The buzzer rings. 
               Apparently the caller has moved from the living-room door to 
               the bedroom door.

               CLOSE SHOT OF THE BED

               Ninotchka is lying on the bed, still in her evening dress. 
               The diadem is no longer on her head, but no special emphasis 
               is laid on that detail in the camera angle. We hear the sound 
               of the buzzer ringing again and again. Ninotchka half wakens 
               and calls out something which sounds like "come in" without 
               being fully aware of what she is doing.

               BEDROOM -- AT THE DOOR

               The door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in 
               the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit. Swana 
               looks around, surprised and amused at the state of the room. 
               She walks over to the bed where lies Ninotchka, still not 
               enough awake to face reality. Swana is delighted to have 
               surprised Ninotchka in this condition.

                                     SWANA
                              (ironically)
                         Good morning.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (awakening gradually)
                         What?

                                     SWANA
                         It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow 
                         noon, to be exact. I hope you will 
                         forgive me. I know it's extremely 
                         cruel to waken anyone at such an 
                         hour. Don't you recognize me? I am 
                         the Duchess Swana.

               By now Ninotchka is awake. She gets up and realizes to her 
               acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has found 
               her.

                                     SWANA
                         I know how you feel, my dear. The 
                         morning after always does look grim 
                         if you happen to be wearing last 
                         night's dress. Don't be embarrassed 
                         by my presence, though. You couldn't 
                         have found anybody more sympathetic 
                         to your condition. I remember once 
                         in Petrograd when I felt exactly as 
                         you do. I had to bow from a balcony 
                         to the crowd. My dear, the masses 
                         have no understanding of the feelings 
                         of a lady before noon. Don't you 
                         find that true?

               During Swana's speech Ninotchka has found herself completely.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I think we can cut your visit short. 
                         Leon is not here.

                                     SWANA
                         Of course not, my dear! I didn't 
                         come here with any such suspicion. 
                         How ridiculous!
                              (with a glance toward 
                              the living room)
                         Nor did I come here to pick up his 
                         hat.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S HAT, shot through the bedroom door into 
               the living room where it lies on the table.

               LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM -- TOWARD BEDROOM DOOR

               By the bed stand Ninotchka and Swana. Swana starts toward 
               the living room, Ninotchka following her.

                                     SWANA
                              (as she reaches the 
                              threshold)
                         How stale last night's gaiety looks! 
                         It has the taste of a dead cigarette.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         If you were encouraged to come here 
                         by our meeting last night I am afraid 
                         you misunderstood my attitude.

                                     SWANA
                         Don't worry, you were quite rude 
                         enough.
                              (during the following 
                              speech, she draws 
                              the curtains and 
                              opens the windows)
                         Do you mind if I let in a little 
                         fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it 
                         will make you feel better and I want 
                         you to be at your very best. In full 
                         possession of your faculties, at 
                         least.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (regaining her usual 
                              firmness)
                         Please come to the point. What is it 
                         you want?

                                     SWANA
                         I just dropped in to have a little 
                         heart-to-heart talk with you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         We have nothing to discuss.

                                     SWANA
                         Now there you are completely wrong. 
                         If we sit down for a little chat, 
                         I'm sure we won't run out of 
                         conversation and what's more it won't 
                         be dull.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Madame, what is it you people always 
                         say, regardless of what you mean... 
                         "I am delighted to have you here"? I 
                         have not reached that stage of 
                         civilization.

                                     SWANA
                         That's all right... I grow on people.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I must ask you to leave.

                                     SWANA
                         Leave? That's exactly what I came 
                         here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't 
                         mean this hotel and I don't mean 
                         Paris... I mean France. There's a 
                         plane for Moscow at five-forty.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (puzzled)
                         Madame, if you...

                                     SWANA
                         Don't worry. I have already made 
                         reservations. It's perfect flying 
                         weather. They assure me there's a 
                         fine tail wind which will sweep you 
                         back to Moscow in no time.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (still not 
                              understanding)
                         If this is meant to be a joke it is 
                         not funny. Or do you still think 
                         you're issuing orders from your palace 
                         in Petrograd?

               Ninotchka's words for the first time sting Swana out of her 
               apparently superficial attitude.

                                     SWANA
                              (bitterly)
                         My palace in Petrograd... yes, you 
                         took that away from me. You took 
                         away my czar, my country, my people, 
                         everything I had...
                              (with emphasis)
                         but nothing more -- I warn you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (simply)
                         People cannot be taken away, madame, 
                         neither a hundred and sixty million 
                         nor one. Not if you have their love. 
                         You hadn't. That's why you're not in 
                         Russia any longer, and that's why 
                         you came here this morning.

                                     SWANA
                         Very interesting, my dear, but 
                         couldn't you write all that from 
                         Moscow? A dissertation on love on 
                         Soviet stationery -- would be an 
                         amusing paradox.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It is not enough to be witty, madame. 
                         People grow tired of being 
                         entertained. You made that mistake 
                         before. Problems were never solved 
                         by bowing from a balcony.

                                     SWANA
                         My dear, you don't know how impressive 
                         I could be. Did you ever see me in 
                         my regalia with my diadem and all my 
                         jewels?

               The word diadem startles Ninotchka. She starts to remember 
               the night before, and she looks toward the safe.

               INSERT OF THE DOOR OF THE SAFE, which is closed by now.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND SWANA

               Ninotchka stares in the direction of the safe as Swana 
               chatters on.

                                     SWANA
                         You can't deny we gave the people 
                         their money's worth -- almost -- 
                         eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (desperately)
                         I must insist that you leave.

                                     SWANA
                         Not before you agree to use those 
                         reservations to Moscow.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         In that case I can only say good-by.

               Abruptly she walks toward the bedroom.

               TRAVELING SHOT OF NINOTCHKA

               She enters the small room connecting the living room and 
               bedroom and closes the door to the living room. She walks 
               into the bedroom toward the bed and glances at it. The diadem 
               is not there. After going back into the anteroom, she opens 
               the outer door of the safe and pulls on the inner door. It 
               has not been properly closed and opens at once. The safe is 
               empty. Ninotchka stands staring in frozen horror for a moment, 
               then rushes to the telephone by the bed.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (into the telephone)
                         Élysée 2763.

               LONG SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AT THE TELEPHONE, waiting for her 
               connection

               In the background the door to the living room is opened by 
               Swana.

                                     SWANA
                              (standing in the door)
                         I wouldn't waken Leon. After last 
                         night I would say not before three 
                         o'clock at the earliest.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I told you to go, madame.

                                     SWANA
                         Believe me, Leon can't help you. He 
                         doesn't know anything about the 
                         jewels... I give you my word... I 
                         swear it.

               Ninotchka hangs up the receiver and stares at Swana. She 
               walks toward her.

               LIVING ROOM, SHOOTING INTO THE BEDROOM. In the foreground 
               Swana, in the background Ninotchka, who is hurrying toward 
               her.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Where are they?

                                     SWANA
                         You were very careless with our 
                         precious jewels, my dear. They're 
                         too expensive a toy for two children 
                         to play with.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Where are they?

                                     SWANA
                         Don't worry. Fortunately last night 
                         a very trustworthy friend kept his 
                         eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped 
                         his function as a waiter but he 
                         fulfilled his duty as a Russian.
                              (she draws back the 
                              fur scarf she is 
                              wearing, revealing a 
                              diamond star, one of 
                              the jewels we have 
                              seen)
                         I just put this on for sentiment. 
                         The rest are absolutely safe. I assure 
                         you. But if you feel like notifying 
                         the police...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You leave me no choice.

                                     SWANA
                         Won't it be rather embarrassing for 
                         a Soviet Envoy to disclose the 
                         circumstances under which she lost 
                         them?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I will have to face the consequences, 
                         but so will you. Don't forget they 
                         will ask how you got them.

                                     SWANA
                         That's very simple to answer. They 
                         were given to me by my mother. They 
                         were given to her by her mother, in 
                         fact they're mine, you cannot steal 
                         what belongs to you!

               She proceeds into the living room, followed by Ninotchka.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         They always belonged to the Russian 
                         people. They were paid for with their 
                         sweat, their blood, their lives and 
                         you will give them back!

                                     SWANA
                              (triumphantly)
                         I told you we had plenty to talk 
                         about. Shall we sit down?

               They both sit.

                                     SWANA
                              (very matter-of-fact)
                         Now, let's free ourselves from 
                         emotionalism and try to solve the 
                         problem in a practical way. Our 
                         situation has changed considerably. 
                         Before I had only a claim to the 
                         jewels. Now I have the jewels.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         In other words moral ideas have no 
                         weight with you... all right, then 
                         let's deal with legal facts. You 
                         know that France has recognized the 
                         Soviet.

                                     SWANA
                         Unfortunately.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Under Soviet law the jewels belong 
                         to the State. France is going to 
                         uphold that ownership.

                                     SWANA
                         My lawyer agrees with you. He says 
                         France will uphold it in every court, 
                         but I will drag you through every 
                         court, don't forget that. And when I 
                         say it will take two years I am, as 
                         always, conservative.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Won't those two years in court be 
                         expensive for you? I know that money 
                         was no object as long as you could 
                         squeeze it from the pockets of the 
                         people, but now...

                                     SWANA
                         I may run out of money, but you have 
                         already run out of bread. Two years 
                         is a long time for your comrades to 
                         wait.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I see. You have calculated in terms 
                         of hunger.

                                     SWANA
                         No, I just wanted to be absolutely 
                         impartial. Both of us are faced with 
                         two rather uncomfortable years. We 
                         can condense these two years to two 
                         minutes if you want to accept my 
                         proposition. Ninotchka now realizes 
                         what she is after.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Go on.

                                     SWANA
                         I am willing to hand over the jewels 
                         and sign the necessary papers if you 
                         take that five-forty plane to Moscow.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (quietly)
                         That's not the way to win him back... 
                         not Leon.

                                     SWANA
                         I think I know Leon quite as well as 
                         you... possibly a little better. 
                         Leave that worry to me. Five-forty 
                         leaves you time enough to close the 
                         deal with Monsieur Mercier, but 
                         naturally you'll be too busy for any 
                         farewells. I'll see to it that 
                         everything is done in the most 
                         expeditious manner and I will also 
                         see you to the airport. That's my 
                         proposition, Comrade Yakushova.

               Ninotchka knows herself to be faced with an inevitable 
               decision. For a moment she cannot answer. The telephone rings. 
               Ninotchka takes the receiver.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (into telephone)
                         Yes...
                              (it is Leon)
                         Oh hello...

               Much as she wants to talk to him she hesitates in the presence 
               of Swana. Swana realizes the situation, gets up, and walks 
               over to the window, where she stands looking out.

               CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA AT TELEPHONE

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Good morning, Leon...
                              (forcing herself to 
                              be gay so that he 
                              will not suspect 
                              anything)
                         ... no, you didn't waken me... I am 
                         fine, thank you.... Yes, it was... 
                         marvelous.... What?... for luncheon? 
                         I'm afraid I can't. I am going to be 
                         very busy...
                              (looking for excuses)
                         well, I have a lot of things to attend 
                         to today.... What?... Well to tell 
                         you the truth I am a little tired 
                         and I would like to rest...
                              (she forces herself 
                              to laugh)
                         you may be right... perhaps it is 
                         the champagne.... For dinner?... Of 
                         course... seven o'clock here?...
                              (realizing that she 
                              will be gone by then)
                         seven o'clock is all right.... 
                         Where?... That will be lovely.... 
                         Yes...
                              (there is a knock on 
                              the door)
                         Come in.
                              (into the telephone)
                         Yes?...
                              (looking toward the 
                              door she sees 
                              something which makes 
                              her stop the 
                              conversation)
                         Just a moment...
                              (she puts the receiver 
                              on the table and 
                              walks toward the 
                              door)

               ANTEROOM BETWEEN LIVING ROOM AND CORRIDOR, shooting toward 
               the living room. In the background we see Swana standing at 
               the window. Ninotchka comes into the anteroom, closes the 
               door in order to shut off Swana's view. Camera pans with 
               Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy 
               is putting down a big flower basket.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (to bellboy)
                         You can leave it here.

               The bellboy exits. Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers 
               for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to 
               the handle. She opens it and reads the enclosed letter. It 
               must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet. She turns to the 
               last page.

               INSERT

               "...and sweetheart, I have kept my first promise. I sent 
               poor old Gaston to the market this morning and if you will 
               look deep into the flowers you will see what I got for 
               him...."

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA

               She puts her hand in the basket and takes out a bottle of 
               milk.

               INSERT OF THE BOTTLE

               On the label we see a picture of a goat.

               NINOTCHKA

               She smiles sadly and goes to the telephone, which is on the 
               console in the anteroom.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (into telephone)
                         Operator, will you switch the call 
                         please?... Hello?... Darling, your 
                         present just arrived.... It's very 
                         silly and very wonderful... thank 
                         you... No, I won't forget... seven 
                         o'clock....
                              (with great tenderness)
                         Good-by, my darling.... What?... 
                         Oh...
                              (softly)
                         salute!

               She puts down the receiver. Camera pans with her as she goes 
               to the door of the living room. She opens the door and goes 
               in. Swana turns from the window.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I am sorry to have kept you waiting, 
                         madame.

               SWANA -- AT THE AIRPORT

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               shooting from a HIGH ANGLE. We hear the SOUND of an airplane 
               just taking off. Camera pulls back so that Swana seems to be 
               photographed from the airplane. Finally the SHOT discloses 
               the whole airport and Swana disappearing into the crowd.

               ENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

               Swana's maid is opening the door for Swana, who enters in 
               the highest spirits.

                                     SWANA
                         Good afternoon, Jacqueline.

                                     MAID
                         Good afternoon, Your Highness.
                              (hesitantly)
                         Madame, I...

                                     SWANA
                         You didn't find my glove. All right, 
                         you're forgiven.

                                     MAID
                         Thank you, Your Highness. Count 
                         d'Algout is waiting. He's been here 
                         some time.

               Swana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror, proceeds 
               into the living room.

               LIVING ROOM -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

               Leon is pacing up and down. Swana enters.

                                     SWANA
                         Leon, darling, how nice! Have you 
                         ordered tea or a cocktail?

                                     LEON
                         No thanks, Swana.

                                     SWANA
                         Did I act stupidly last night? Should 
                         I apologize?

                                     LEON
                         I'm the one who should apologize. I 
                         should have talked to you before.

                                     SWANA
                         Is this, by any chance, going to be 
                         a confession?

                                     LEON
                         Yes.

                                     SWANA
                         Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. 
                         Have you forgotten our First 
                         Commandment: Never Complain -- Never 
                         Explain. It has worked so often and 
                         so perfectly, don't let's break the 
                         rule. And please don't look so guilty, 
                         otherwise I'll...

                                     LEON
                         This time, Swana -- just this once -- 
                         I must ask you to listen.

                                     SWANA
                         All right, I'll listen.

                                     LEON
                         I know you hate the obvious but do 
                         you mind if, at this moment, I'm not 
                         in the least subtle?

                                     SWANA
                         Brutal frankness, if you insist.

                                     LEON
                         There are a hundred ways to approach 
                         it, but I feel it can best be said 
                         in one simple phrase. I'm in love, 
                         Swana.

                                     SWANA
                         And I thought it was something 
                         serious! How could you frighten me 
                         so?

                                     LEON
                         It must be serious, Swana. Not long 
                         ago I'd have considered such a 
                         statement rather juvenile and rather 
                         middle class. Now I can say it without 
                         stammering, without a blush. I'm in 
                         love, Swana.

                                     SWANA
                         Say it over and over again, Leon. 
                         Words are a wonderful safety valve, 
                         and that's what you need -- because 
                         you know it's impossible, don't you?

                                     LEON
                         I have to be simple again, Swana, 
                         and you may find it shockingly banal. 
                         I've thought it over and I'm willing 
                         to take all the consequences, even 
                         if it means a complete readjustment 
                         of my way of living.

                                     SWANA
                         Leon! This has the ugly sound of 
                         regeneration.

                                     LEON
                         I'm afraid that's what it is.

                                     SWANA
                         The same old trouble, Leon. You're 
                         always late. Whether you're taking 
                         me to the Opera or calling for me at 
                         a beauty shop, you're never on time. 
                         And now, when it's a question of 
                         your reform -- late again.
                              (she glances at her 
                              wrist watch)
                         By about five minutes.

                                     LEON
                         What is this, Swana?

                                     SWANA
                         Knowing the efficiency of the French 
                         Air Service I think I can guarantee 
                         that Madame Yakushova has already 
                         taken off for Moscow.

                                     LEON
                         Has done what?

                                     SWANA
                         She's gone, Leon.

                                     LEON
                         Do you expect me to believe that?

               Swana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it 
               out to him.

                                     SWANA
                         Here's the telephone. If you call 
                         the hotel you will find that you 
                         have no seven o'clock appointment.

               THE MOSCOW PLANE

               It is flying past the Eiffel Tower.

               CLOSE SHOT -- AIRPLANE WINDOW

               Behind the window we see Ninotchka looking at Paris for the 
               last time. Camera moves over to the next window and we see 
               Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski also giving Paris a sad 
               farewell look.

               ANOTHER VIEW OF PARIS, from the air. The mist has closed in 
               by now so that only the top of the Eiffel Tower is visible 
               above it.

               CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA, looking down on the Tower

               INTERIOR, Airplane -- Ninotchka, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and 
               Kopalski

               Ninotchka turns from the window and leans against the back 
               of her chair. The Russians follow her example. There is a 
               moment of silence and sadness.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Imagine, for once in our lives we 
                         were in Paris and we never went to 
                         the Eiffel Tower.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         That's right.

                                     IRANOFF
                         They tell me it has a wonderful 
                         restaurant on the second floor.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         While you eat, you look at the view.

               CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA

               She is trying to overcome all sentimentality, but as the 
               following speech progresses she cannot escape the personal 
               implication involved.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes, it is an amazing piece of 
                         engineering. Still the most remarkable 
                         iron structure in the world. Leading 
                         to the top there is a staircase of 
                         over a thousand steps... but an 
                         elevator is included in the price of 
                         admission.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INSERT OF A PARIS NEWSPAPER

               HERALD DU MATIN

               Camera zooms down on a headline of an article.

               Mercier buys priceless russian jewels. Russian commission 
               has left for moscow.

               STREET IN PARIS -- MORNING

               Camera follows Leon as he walks excitedly and nervously along 
               the boulevard. He turns into a Russian Intouriste Bureau, 
               one of the travel bureaus maintained by the Soviet government 
               in foreign countries to supply information regarding travel, 
               give visas, etc.

               INTOURISTE BUREAU

               It is a typical travel bureau. Behind the counter are 
               attendants and some people getting information and pamphlets. 
               Leon enters, looks around, and sees a door which says "Visas 
               and Passport Department." He enters.

               INTERIOR, VISA ROOM

               It is a room smaller than the previous one. Behind the counter 
               stands a typical Bolshevik Official. In front of the counter 
               is an elderly English lady. Leon takes his place behind her, 
               nervous at having to wait. The Official stamps the English 
               lady's passport and hands it to her.

                         Well, everything is in order. I hope 
                         you will enjoy your trip to Russia, 
                         madame.

                                     ENGLISH LADY
                         Thank you. Oh, by the way, I've heard 
                         so many rumors about laundry 
                         conditions in Russia. Is it advisable 
                         to take one's own towels?

                                     OFFICIAL
                         Certainly not, madame. That's only 
                         capitalistic propaganda. We change 
                         the towel every week.

                         Oh... thank you.

               She leaves. Leon moves up to the Official.

               At this moment the telephone rings. The Official takes the 
               receiver.

                         sorry... he hasn't been with us for 
                         six months. He was called back to 
                         Russia and was investigated. You can 
                         get further details from his widow.

               He hangs up the receiver. Leon, thinking of Ninotchka, is 
               horrified by this statement.

                         an envoy goes back to Russia -- if 
                         they don't like what he has done

                         (suavely) After our talk last night 
                         I took it for granted that you would 
                         drop in here this morning. Knowing 
                         how difficult it is to get into Soviet 
                         Russia, I thought I might be of some 
                         assistance to you.

                         Just in case they don't give you 
                         your visa to Russia I want you to 
                         know that I have signed a contract 
                         for my memoirs and rented a lovely 
                         little château in the Touraine, and

               His words are unmistakably a final dismissal. She walks out. 
               Leon looks after her for a second, then goes back to the 
               Official. He tries to laugh off the incident.

                         just the beginning!

               He strides out.

               The Official's head emerges from the counter. As he adjusts 
               his bruised jaw, he speaks.

                         March, march, march! Comrades of the 
                         World, never has there been such a 
                         May Day parade as this! Already for 
                         four hours the pavements of Moscow 
                         have resounded to the tread of a 
                         million boots! Thousands of gun-
                         carriages have thundered past. 
                         Thousands of tanks, combined with 
                         our mighty air force, have 
                         demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor 
                         that we are ready and invincible! 
                         Now past me marches the great army 
                         of our civilians! Men and women of 
                         all ages. All servants of the State 
                         united in one thought and ideal. 
                         Group of Several Units Marching

               Workmen, soldiers, tanks, airplanes, etc.

               Column of Women, dressed in typical Russian May Day parade 
               fashion, marching and saluting. The CAMERA NARROWS DOWN to a 
               CLOSE SHOT OF Ninotchka marching with the others. All her 
               individuality is gone. She is one of many, a cog in the 
               Russian machine. With a stern expression she is looking 
               straight ahead when suddenly something attracts her attention 
               and she glances to one side.

               A Column of Male Workers is coming in the opposite direction. 
               Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are recognizable among them.

               CLOSE SHOT -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI MARCHING. All 
               three are already pretty exhausted from the long march. 
               Kopalski sees Ninotchka. He whispers it to the others. The 
               three look toward Ninotchka and lift their shoulders with a 
               gesture which says, "Look where we are now."

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, answering them with a sad smile. 
               After they have passed she stares straight forward again 
               with the same stern expression.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PANNING SHOT -- STAIRCASE IN NINOTCHKA'S TENEMENT HOUSE

               It is an overcrowded house. People are walking up and down 
               stairs, standing grouped in front of the various apartments; 
               children are sliding down the banisters and playing games 
               under the feet of the adults.

               Ninotchka trudges upstairs wearily. Camera pans with her as 
               she goes into an apartment which is divided into several sub-
               apartments. Finally she opens the door of her own room and 
               goes in.

               NINOTCHKA'S ROOM

               It is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two 
               other girls. As she enters only one girl is present. It is 
               Anna, a cello player, who sits on the edge of her bed 
               practicing on her cello. Apparently Ninotchka has not adjusted 
               herself completely to the Moscow which she once thought so 
               great.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Good evening, Anna.

                                     ANNA
                         Good evening, Ninotchka.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Aren't you late?

                                     ANNA
                         No, the opera starts an hour later 
                         tonight on account of the parade.

               During the following scene Anna puts her cello in its case 
               and gets ready to go to her job. Ninotchka starts to arrange 
               the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. 
               Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, 
               a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a 
               tablecloth.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Didn't you march?

               Anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the Bolshevik 
               regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it.

                                     ANNA
                         They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. 
                         Last week at the performance of Carmen 
                         I played a sour note. The conductor 
                         got so excited he yelled, "There's 
                         sabotage in the string section!"

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Too bad... you missed an inspiring 
                         day, Anna.

                                     ANNA
                         I know... my heart is sad... but my 
                         feet are happy. When all the tanks 
                         and guns were roaring over the Red 
                         Square I sat here all by myself and 
                         played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad 
                         at all.
                              (she has noticed 
                              Ninotchka's 
                              preparations)
                         Are you expecting someone?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         A few friends... just a little dinner 
                         party.

                                     ANNA
                         What are you serving?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         An omelet.

                                     ANNA
                              (puzzled)
                         An omelet! Aren't you living a little 
                         above your ration?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Well, I've saved up two eggs and 
                         each of my friends is bringing his 
                         own so we'll manage.

                                     ANNA
                         It just goes to prove the theory of 
                         our State. If you stand alone it 
                         means a boiled egg but if you're 
                         true to the collective spirit and 
                         stick together you've got an omelet.
                              (devilishly)
                         That reminds me... have you heard 
                         the latest they're telling about the 
                         Kremlin?

               At this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens 
               and Gurganov, a middle-aged man with a sour stool-pigeon 
               expression, walks quietly through the room to another door, 
               taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the 
               impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open. 
               Anna breaks off her remark.

                                     ANNA
                              (whispering)
                         I'll tell you later.
                              (after Gurganov has 
                              disappeared into the 
                              other room she 
                              continues)
                         That Gurganov, you never know whether 
                         he's on his way to the washroom or 
                         the Secret Police.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You should be more careful, Anna.

                                     ANNA
                         And you too, Ninotchka.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (amazed)
                         About what?

                                     ANNA
                         Ever since you have been back from 
                         Paris...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I haven't talked to anyone about 
                         Paris. I haven't said a word.

                                     ANNA
                         That's just it. It makes people feel 
                         queer. I dont' want you to get in 
                         any trouble.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I have nothing to hide.

                                     ANNA
                         You should. I'll show you.

               She walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of 
               lingerie and comes back to Ninotchka with it.

                                     ANNA
                         When I passed through the laundry 
                         yard today I saw all the women huddled 
                         around this so I brought it up here. 
                         Things like this create a bad feeling. 
                         First they didn't know whose it was. 
                         Then they saw the Paris label and 
                         did it start a commotion! Some said 
                         it's what we all ought to wear and 
                         others said it's like hanging foreign 
                         ideas on our clothesline. It 
                         undermines our whole cause.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (aware of the pettiness 
                              which surrounds her)
                         I see.

                                     ANNA
                         You know how it is today... all you 
                         have to do is wear a pair of silk 
                         stockings and they suspect you of 
                         counter-revolution.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here 
                         when I wash it next. I should hate 
                         to see our country endangered by my 
                         underwear.

                                     ANNA
                              (confidentially)
                         Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, 
                         you can trust me.... Did you bring 
                         back anything else?

               Ninotchka suddenly is transported to Paris in her memory.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (with feeling)
                         No, I left everything in Paris. I 
                         just happened to be wearing this.

                                     ANNA
                         Tell me... what else did you have?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (enjoying the thought)
                         Well, a hat...

                                     ANNA
                         What was it like?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It was very silly.... I would be 
                         ashamed to wear it here.

                                     ANNA
                         As beautiful as that? What else? 
                         Come, tell me.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         An evening gown.

                                     ANNA
                              (puzzled)
                         Evening gown?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         A dress you wear in the evening.

                                     ANNA
                         What do you wear in the morning?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         When you get up you put on a negligee, 
                         and then you change to a morning 
                         frock.

                                     ANNA
                         You mean to tell me you wear a 
                         different dress for different times 
                         of the day?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes.

                                     ANNA
                         Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No, my dear, it is true. That's how 
                         they live in the other world. Here 
                         we dress to have our bodies covered... 
                         to keep warm....

                                     ANNA
                         And there?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Well, sometimes they're not completely 
                         covered but... they don't freeze.

                                     ANNA
                              (fingering the piece 
                              of lingerie)
                         They must have wonderful materials 
                         to make a thing like this so soft... 
                         something you don't even see.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You feel it, though.

                                     ANNA
                              (hesitantly)
                         Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up 
                         if we weren't such good friends.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         What is it, Anna?

                                     ANNA
                         You know I told you that Pavlov and 
                         I are going to get married when he 
                         comes back from the maneuvers. Would 
                         it be asking too much...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You want this?

                                     ANNA
                         Just for the honeymoon.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You can have it for good. It is my 
                         wedding present.

               Anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift. She 
               embraces and kisses Ninotchka.

                                     ANNA
                         Ninotchka! Ninotchka!

               She kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave.

                                     ANNA
                         Am I going to play that cadenza 
                         tonight!

               Anna exits, closing the door. Ninotchka is left alone. Her 
               thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with Leon. 
               Mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything 
               is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive 
               little machine). As she turns the knob she smiles again 
               reminiscently. As she does, the blare of a Russian speech 
               brings her back to reality.

                                     VOICE ON RADIO
                         Individuals? Yes, as atoms in the 
                         cosmos of Soviet Russia. Family? 
                         Yes. One great family of one hundred 
                         and sixty million, struggling, 
                         fighting, victorious Russian 
                         proletarians. Thus shall we pursue 
                         our way into the future, fists 
                         clenched, hearts encased in steel 
                         armed against bourgeois sentimentality 
                         and...

               Quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of 
               Russian oratory.

               SECOND VOICE ON RADIO

               ...From the Exploiters for the Toilers. We are going full 
               steam ahead through industrialization toward socialism. Let 
               us put the Union of Socialistic Soviet Republics into an 
               automobile and the muzhik into a tractor, and then let the 
               capitalists try to keep up with us! The same thing happens 
               for a third time.

               THIRD VOICE ON RADIO

               ...and thirty million peasants, eighty-five per cent of the 
               population owned three hundred forty-three million four 
               hundred and sixty-nine thousand acres of land, sixty-five 
               per cent of the total area. And one hundred and fifty thousand 
               nobles possessed thirty-five per cent of the country's natural 
               wealth!

               Ninotchka turns off the radio. She closes her eyes for a 
               moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No music.

               At this moment the door opens, and Buljanoff, Iranoff, and 
               Kopalski enter. There follow warm greetings between Ninotchka 
               and the Three Russians.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         Ninotchka! Ninotchka!

               A moment of silence follows. The four look at each other as 
               people do who share a secret.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (with great warmth)
                         How are you, you three scoundrels?

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (wryly)
                         Well, we're back home.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (sourly)
                         You know what they say -- there's 
                         nothing like home.

                                     IRANOFF
                         That's right... and we might as well 
                         face it.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (trying not to say 
                              what she feels)
                         Come, now, you must not talk that 
                         way.... You have to adjust 
                         yourselves.... We must be brave.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Brave... that's right.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Let's be happy that we're all alive.

                                     IRANOFF
                         And that's something we owe to 
                         Ninotchka.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin 
                         such a wonderful report about us, 
                         who knows what would have happened?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         I can tell you exactly.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Now let's forget everything except 
                         that we're together.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         That's right.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Let's do that.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (falling in with her 
                              attempt)
                         It's a real Paris reunion.

                                     IRANOFF
                         If you close your eyes and listen to 
                         our voices we might be in Paris.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Let's not close our eyes. There are 
                         many good things to see here too.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (cynically)
                         I think I need my glasses.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (reprimanding him 
                              quietly)
                         A little more tact... look how nicely 
                         she's fixed the table -- all for us.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (in a loud voice, 
                              trying to make up 
                              for his faux pas)
                         How nicely you've fixed the table, 
                         Ninotchka.

                                     IRANOFF
                         What a lovely room you have here.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         How many families live here with 
                         you?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Only myself and two other girls. One 
                         is a cello player in the opera and 
                         the other a street-car conductor.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (impressed)
                         Just three people in a room this 
                         size? Whew!

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (inspecting the room)
                         And your own gas cooker? That's 
                         marvelous!
                              (forgetting himself)
                         Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Sssh! Once and for all, we're in 
                         Moscow!

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (walking over to the 
                              window)
                         Yes, there's no doubt of that...
                              (sarcastically)
                         Just look out of the window and there 
                         it is.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         And it's great! Think what it was a 
                         few years ago and what it is now.

               Iranoff and Buljanoff have joined them at the window.

                                     IRANOFF
                         She's right...
                              (under his breath)
                         anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Just see how happy the people look... 
                         from here....

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Can you blame them?... at least the 
                         May Day parade is over.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         That's another thing... it's spring.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         The same spring we had in Paris. 
                         Just as good.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Even the swallows are back.

                                     BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
                         Yes, that's right.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Maybe that's the same swallow we saw 
                         in Paris!

                                     BULJANOFF
                         It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must 
                         have been in Paris! You can see it 
                         in his whole attitude! He just picked 
                         up a crumb of our black bread, shook 
                         his head, and dropped it.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         If you asked him why he left France 
                         I bet he couldn't name one good 
                         reason.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         I should be a swallow! Right now I 
                         would be sitting in front of the 
                         Café de Paris picking up flakes of 
                         French pastry that would melt in my 
                         bill.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Now, comrades... there is something 
                         better in life than crumbs of French 
                         pastry.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (the realist)
                         Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         We will get that... we'll get 
                         everything... maybe a little bit 
                         later but we'll get it... We must be 
                         patient... Finally we got the spring, 
                         didn't we? We got the swallows, and 
                         you will get your apfel strudel too.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (consolingly)
                         And if it is too late for you your 
                         children will eat it.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (breaking the mood)
                         Let's forget the future... let's 
                         stop being sentimental... let's start 
                         that omelet.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         That's right.
                              (he takes a little 
                              box out of his pocket)
                         Here's my egg.
                              (he hands it to 
                              Ninotchka)

               Iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief.

                                     IRANOFF
                         And here's mine.

               He hands it to Ninotchka.

               Buljanoff reaches in his pocket and from his expression we 
               see that a catastrophe must have happened.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Don't worry... there will be enough.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Come, Ninotchka, let's make it in 
                         real Parisian style!

               The group all go to the gas cooker and Ninotchka starts to 
               make the omelet. The others stand around as though they were 
               watching a great event.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Let's fill it with confitures, des 
                         prunes...

                                     BULJANOFF
                         ...des raisins de Madère, des 
                         framboises...
                              (...with grapes of 
                              Madeira, with 
                              raspberries...)

                                     IRANOFF
                         ...des petites fraises des bois... 
                         de la crème de Bretagne...
                              (...with small wild 
                              strawberries... with 
                              cream...)

                                     KOPALSKI
                         ...so it blows up that big... what 
                         they call an Omelette Surprise!

                                     BULJANOFF
                         And the surprise is there's nothing 
                         in it.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         I know, but if we can't put in all 
                         these wonderful things at least let's 
                         put in some imagination.
                              (he raises his voice)
                         In that one omelet we'll taste the 
                         whole of Paris!

               The door through which Gurganov disappeared opens and Gurganov 
               comes out.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (seeing him)
                         Sssh!

               The conversation stops. Gurganov walks quietly through the 
               room, again observing everything. He goes out at last.

                                     IRANOFF
                         A man like that... all he has to do 
                         is to walk through a room and the 
                         omelet drops.

               There is a dead silence. All are again aware of the reality 
               which surrounds. They concentrate quietly on the frying pan.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INSERT OF THE FRYING PAN

               The eggs are gradually taking the shape of an omelet.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INSERT OF A PLATE ON THE TABLE

               Only the last scraps of the omelet are on it. Buljanoff's 
               hand comes in with a big piece of bread with which he sops 
               up every fragment that is left.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- NINOTCHKA'S ROOM -- EVENING

               The curtains are drawn and the lamp lighted. All four are 
               sitting around the table, in the center of which is a samovar. 
               In front of each of them is a glass of tea. One of the 
               Russians is playing a balalaika and all are singing gaily, 
               "Paris."

               Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship. After a little 
               while the door to the corridor opens and Ninotchka's other 
               roommate, the street-car conductor, strides in. She is a 
               squareset, unfriendly woman in uniform.

               At sight of her one of the Russians nudges Ninotchka, makes 
               the gesture of ringing up a fare, and accompanies it with an 
               inquiring look. Ninotchka nods. The Russians change their 
               tune quickly to the "Volga Boatman" in order not to awaken 
               animosity.

               The street-car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take 
               off her shoes and her coat, then draws the curtain. During 
               the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound 
               of gargling.

               Again Gurganov crosses the room, this time accompanied by 
               his little son.

               Suddenly the door is opened by Vladimir, a friendly old man.

                                     VLADIMIR
                              (calling into the 
                              room)
                         Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman 
                         left a letter for you.

               He hands her a letter and exits.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA

               She takes the letter, glances at the envelope, and is stunned. 
               She turns the envelope -- an expression of breathless wonder 
               comes over her face.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         What is it, Ninotchka?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         It's from Paris.

                                     IRANOFF AND BULJANOFF
                         From Paris?

                                     KOPALSKI
                         A bill?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         From Leon.

                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS
                         From Leon!... How is he?... Come, 
                         tell us... open it... tell us... how 
                         is he?

               Ninotchka sits in the chair nearest the lamp. All three are 
               looking over her shoulder. Ninotchka hesitates to open the 
               letter, obviously wanting to read it all by herself. Realizing 
               her feelings, the Three Russians walk to the far end of the 
               room and sit down on a little bench, looking toward Ninotchka 
               with childlike expectancy. In great anticipation Ninotchka 
               opens the letter. She starts to read it. Suddenly her 
               expression changes to one of terrific disappointment. She 
               turns the letter over, glances at the second page, then puts 
               the letter down on the table. The Russians have followed her 
               expression closely. Slowly they walk over to her.

                                     IRANOFF
                              (very sympathetic)
                         Bad news?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Look for yourselves.

               Iranoff picks up the letter. All three look at it.

               Insert of First Page of Letter, held in Iranoff's hand. In 
               Leon's handwriting we read:

               "Ninotchka, my darling,"

               The rest of the writing is blocked out, line by line, and 
               across the page is a big stamp which says "Censored." 
               Iranoff's hand turns the page. The second page is also 
               censored except for the final words,

               "Yours, Leon."

               SHOT OF THE WHOLE GROUP

               Iranoff puts the letter back on the table. They all understand 
               and realize that Ninotchka wants to be alone.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Well, I think it's getting late. 
                         Good night, Ninotchka.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

               Ninotchka rises and shakes their hands.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (with great warmth)
                         Good night, my friends.

               The three start to leave but Buljanoff returns and whispers 
               to Ninotchka.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         They can't censor our memories, can 
                         they?

               Ninotchka presses his hand. He walks quietly out with the 
               others.

               Ninotchka, left alone, sits down. She is heartbroken. Her 
               thoughts are too sad and too far away to be disturbed by the 
               snoring which comes from the corner where the street-car 
               conductor has gone to bed.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               shooting from the inside. Through the window the background 
               of Moscow. It is winter and snow is on the roofs. The CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK and discloses Razinin sitting at his desk, reading 
               a report with a stern expression.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- RAZININ'S OFFICE

               Ninotchka enters carrying several folders. She walks to 
               Razinin's desk and stands waiting for him to recognize her 
               presence. She is a tired, stern girl. Razinin looks up.

                                     RAZININ
                         Good morning, Comrade.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (very businesslike)
                         Good morning, Comrade Commissar. 
                         Here is my report on the materials 
                         available for trading in the next 
                         four months.

                                     RAZININ
                         Does this include the products of 
                         the Far Eastern provinces?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes, it does.

                                     RAZININ
                         You mean you have finished the whole 
                         investigation?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Yes.

                                     RAZININ
                         That's marvelous.... You must have 
                         worked day and night.... Don't you 
                         ever sleep?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I need very little sleep. We must be 
                         extremely careful what goods we take 
                         in exchange. I have already started 
                         a survey of our most urgent needs.

                                     RAZININ
                         Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will 
                         have to turn over that work to someone 
                         else.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (startled)
                         May I ask why?

                                     RAZININ
                         Please... sit down.

               Ninotchka sits.

                                     RAZININ
                         Cigarette?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Thank you.

                                     RAZININ
                         Well, Comrade, have you heard from 
                         your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, 
                         and Iranoff?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         No.

                                     RAZININ
                         I haven't either, but I've heard 
                         about them. You must realize it was 
                         only on the strength of your Paris 
                         report that I sent them to 
                         Constantinople; without that I never 
                         would have trusted them on a mission 
                         as important as the fur deal.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         May I ask what has happened?

                                     RAZININ
                         As soon as our representatives go to 
                         a foreign country they seem to lose 
                         all sense of balance. If I told you 
                         what's going on in Constantinople 
                         right now you wouldn't believe it. 
                         Those three have been sitting there 
                         for six weeks and haven't sold a 
                         piece of fur.
                              (he points to the 
                              folder)
                         This anonymous report was sent me. 
                         They are dragging the good name of 
                         our country through every café and 
                         night club. Here...
                              (he reads from the 
                              report)
                         "How can the Bolshevik cause gain 
                         respect among the Moslems if your 
                         three representatives, Buljanoff, 
                         Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk 
                         that they throw a carpet out of their 
                         hotel window and complain to the 
                         management that it didn't fly?"

               Ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics 
               of her three old friends.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Oh, they shouldn't do such things. 
                         Are you sure this report is correct?

                                     RAZININ
                         It gives details which couldn't be 
                         invented. Naturally I want to verify 
                         it and that's why I need you.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (apprehensively)
                         You want me to go to Constantinople?

                                     RAZININ
                         Yes... leaving immediately.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (her one object to 
                              escape the mission)
                         I appreciate the confidence you show 
                         in me, but I must ask you to entrust 
                         someone else with this mission. I 
                         should hate to interrupt my present 
                         work. I am positive that my survey 
                         is more important than finding out 
                         whether three of our comrades have 
                         been drinking some extra glasses of 
                         champagne.

                                     RAZININ
                              (austerely)
                         That is for me to decide, Comrade 
                         Yakushova.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I am sorry, I don't want to overstep 
                         my position -- but please... don't 
                         send me.

                                     RAZININ
                         I don't understand.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (making a last effort)
                         How can I make myself clear... It is 
                         difficult to express but I'd rather 
                         not go to foreign countries any more. 
                         Please, Comrade... let me stay here... 
                         let me finish my work... I am in the 
                         rhythm of it now... I don't want to 
                         go away. I don't want to be sent 
                         into that foreign atmosphere again. 
                         It throws one out of gear.... Let me 
                         finish my work... I have concentrated 
                         everything in it... Please... don't 
                         make me go.

                                     RAZININ
                         Please don't waste my time, Comrade. 
                         Do your duty. Good-by.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I will do my best.

               She exits, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CONSTANTINOPLE, on a bright sunlit day, 
               if possible with the circling shadow of an airplane.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT -- AIRPORT IN CONSTANTINOPLE, shooting from an 
               airplane angle. A crowd is awaiting the arrival of a plane. 
               The CAMERA goes down to a CLOSE SHOT of Buljanoff, Iranoff, 
               and Kopalski, standing in the crowd.

               All three are very elegantly and gaily dressed. They are in 
               the happiest mood. One of them carries a large bouquet of 
               flowers to greet Ninotchka.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LIVING ROOM OF A VERY LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE IN CONSTANTINOPLE. 
               Its style should suggest the locale. Ninotchka enters with 
               the Three Russians, who are very happy to have her with them 
               again.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (indicating the room)
                         How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't 
                         it wonderful?

                                     IRANOFF AND BULJANOFF
                         Tell us... tell us.

               Ninotchka protests, but during the whole scene it is evident 
               that behind her protestations there is none of the force and 
               conviction she displayed in a similar situation in the Royal 
               Suite.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...

                                     IRANOFF
                         Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start 
                         figuring it out in cows.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You've done it again and I am 
                         responsible. How can you forget 
                         yourselves this way? You were sent 
                         here to make money, not to spend it.

                                     IRANOFF
                         Buljanoff, she still has those old-
                         fashioned Bolshevik ideas.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         It is high time you got out of Russia.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (not knowing what to 
                              do with the three 
                              rascals)
                         I must be stern with you.

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (delighted)
                         That's our old Ninotchka!

                                     BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
                              (agreeing with him)
                         Yes, yes.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Don't forget, the day will come when 
                         you will have to face Razinin.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (cockily)
                         Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? 
                         How does he manage?

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         But, Comrades...

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (with the happiness 
                              of being free again 
                              in his voice)
                         We are not comrades any more... we 
                         are friends, Ninotchka.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Imagine, we don't have to whisper 
                         any longer.

                                     IRANOFF
                         We can say whatever we want. We can 
                         shout... we can complain... Look...
                              (he opens the door 
                              leading to corridor)
                         The service in this hotel is terrible!
                              (he closes the door)
                         See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any 
                         attention. That's freedom.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (dryly)
                         No, that's bad management.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Is it possible to bring you back to 
                         reality for a moment? I must have a 
                         complete report of your negotiations 
                         and a detailed expense account.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There 
                         is a Turkish proverb which says, "If 
                         something smells bad, why put your 
                         nose in it?"

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         And there is a Russian saying: "The 
                         cat who has cream on his whiskers 
                         had better find good excuses."

                                     BULJANOFF
                         With our cream situation what it is, 
                         it is Russia which should apologize 
                         to the cats.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (helplessly)
                         Friends... friends, Buljanoff, 
                         Iranoff...

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (afraid of being left 
                              out)
                         ...and Kopalski.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (pleadingly)
                         Don't make it difficult for me. This 
                         is no more a pleasure trip for me 
                         than it is for you.

                                     IRANOFF
                         That was our idea when we first came. 
                         All we thought we would get out of 
                         this trip was a Turkish bath, but... 
                         we learned better.

                                     KOPALSKI
                         Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, 
                         the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...

                                     IRANOFF
                         ...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... 
                         into one single hour you can crowd a 
                         thousand and one nights.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         All you have to do is say "open 
                         sesame."

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         I don't know how I can get you out 
                         of it this time. How will it end? 
                         What will happen to you?

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (intimately)
                         Shall we tell her?

                                     IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI
                         Yes.

                                     BULJANOFF
                              (proudly)
                         Ninotchka, I hope you'll be our guest.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Guest?

                                     BULJANOFF
                         We have opened a restaurant...

                                     IRANOFF
                         ...we have a wonderful electric sign: 
                         "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and 
                         Kopalski."

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         You mean you are deserting Russia?

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (singing the song of 
                              freedom)
                         Don't call it desertion. Our little 
                         restaurant... that is our Russia... 
                         the Russia of borscht, the Russia of 
                         beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour 
                         cream...

                                     IRANOFF
                         ...the Russia of piroshki... people 
                         will eat and love it.

                                     BULJANOFF
                         We are not only serving good food, 
                         we are serving our country... we are 
                         making friends.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (completely bewildered)
                         Who gave you this idea? What is 
                         responsible for all this?

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (with a gleam in his 
                              eye)
                         There's something in Constantinople... 
                         something irresistible....

                                     IRANOFF
                         ...it is in the air... it may come 
                         around the corner as you walk down 
                         the street....

                                     BULJANOFF
                         ...it may step out of a bazaar... it 
                         may wait for you in a corridor... it 
                         may hide in the shadow of a 
                         minaret....

                                     KOPALSKI
                              (pointing to the 
                              balcony)
                         Right now it's on the balcony.

               Ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded as she 
               sees Leon standing there smiling at her. He walks quietly 
               toward her.

                                     LEON
                              (looking longingly at 
                              Ninotchka)
                         They wouldn't let me in so I had to 
                         get you out.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                              (still taken aback)
                         So -- you're behind all this. I should 
                         have known.

               Leon takes her hand and kisses it. The Three Russians exchange 
               glances. The CAMERA PANS WITH THEM --leaving Ninotchka and 
               Leon as Russians walk discreetly out of the room and close 
               the door behind them.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA

                                     LEON
                         Trying to keep me away from you! It 
                         couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't 
                         go on forever punching passport 
                         officials in the nose -- but I found 
                         a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to 
                         see you. I wrote and wrote but all 
                         my letters came back.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         The one I got they wouldn't let me 
                         read.
                              (carried away by 
                              emotion)
                         It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," 
                         and ended, "Yours, Leon."

                                     LEON
                              (with great feeling 
                              and sincerity)
                         I won't tell you what came between... 
                         I'll prove it. It will take a long 
                         time, Ninotchka... at least a 
                         lifetime.

               Ninotchka is aware that she is facing a decision. She knows 
               what she wants but still tries to evade a definite answer.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         But, Leon, I am only here for a few 
                         days.

                                     LEON
                         If you don't stay with me, I'll have 
                         to continue my fight. I'll travel 
                         wherever Russian commissions are. 
                         I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, 
                         Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world 
                         will be crowded with Russian 
                         restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. 
                         Once you saved your country by going 
                         back. This time you can save it by 
                         staying here.

                                     NINOTCHKA
                         Well, when it is a choice between my 
                         personal interest and the good of my 
                         country, how can I waver? No one 
                         shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.

               Leon takes her in his arms, they kiss as we

          INT. PAVILLION CAMP . WEEHAWKEN-- IGHT-

          1994. A summer camp in- Northern Michigan. It's a dance. An
          over-enthusiastic counselor with a massive boombox stereo.
          Coolio's "Fantastic Voyage" blasts.

          About ten thirteen-year-old boys are lined up along the side.
          'Hair down to their ears and parted in the middle-- little
          versions of Kurt Cobain or Jord Catalano.

          They are staring at a group of dancing girls - In the middle
          is KATIE, the blonde who grew boobs before anyone else. And
          every time she moves; she bounces.                 

                         

                         

                         
          The boys watch her, serious, concentrating. They need to
          remember this for later. Katie continues to bounce- One boy
          suddenly looks down, scared.

                         BOY
          It tickles.

                         OTHER BOY-
          Yeah. It does other stuff.
          But there's a boy on the, edge of the group : A sweet. face, 'and
          you wouldn't be surprised to- find but he's Jewish: A 12 year -
          old, Adam Kurtzman. He's the only boy not looking at Katie.
          Instead, he's staring off in another direction.

          On the other side of the dance floor, next to an 'enormously '
          fat kid, there's Emma. She's an awkward 12. Wearing borrowed
          clothes- a skirt that's a little too long, a top that she
          can't fill out. She's taller than any of the boys. But 
          there's something in her eyes, like she's laughing at
          everything.

          She makes eye,contact with Adam: She squints., He takes -a deep
          breath,. She squints some more. He walks over.-'.

                         ADAM
          Hey. -

                         EMMA
          Hey.
          A 'long' pause'. -They're not looking at each other. Then

                         ADAM
          Do you want to, freak?

          INT. PAV'ILLION-- MOMENTS LATER

          TLC's "No Scrubs." Emma and Adam are freaking awkwardly - Emma
          is too tall and Adam is holding on too tight and just
          bouncing up and down. -

                         ADAM
          You freak, good.

                         EMMA
          Okay.

                         ADAM
          - (singing along with the SONG)
           "No, I don't want no scrubs"--

          Because he's hanging out of his.
          best friend's ride, trying to
          -holler at her.
          Katie, in another part of the dance floor, is in the middle
          of a big freak-sandwich.

                         KATIE

          CAMP RULES!
          Emma scowls at her, looks at Adam.

                         

                         EMMA
          Let's go to the dumpster-

          We're not even going out.

          But I feel like I've known you.my
          whole life.

          EXT. CAMP GROUNDS- NIGHT -

          Emma and Adam awkwardly stand against-the wall near the
          dumpster. There are couples on either side. of them making
          out.
          So.

                         ADAM
          I've enjoyed camp. There's all
          kinds of fun activities. For
          example, I learned how to-archer.

                         EMMA
          That's good. That'll be useful if 
          you ever make a time machine and go
          back'to the medieval ages:-and then
          your-time machine breaks, and you
          get attacked by knights.

                         ADAM
          You're funny. It's weird.

          Hi,. Scottie? It's Emma. I.know this
          is weird, but do you know where I

          (laughing at himself)
          Hello Los :Angeles.
          Emma, with a hoodie over her scrubs, comes in the back.

          ADAM (CONT'D).
          Someone told me recently that I
          look like Richard Nixon when I Gum.
          Adam does a little- imitation of what that looks. like. Emma
          smiles, -kind of embarrassed. She looks over and sees Alv n
          and Vanessa there too, laughing.-She's surprised'.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          And it suddenly became clear why
          none of my girlfriends ever wanted
          to have sex with me. I thought it
          was just because my dick was too
          big and it scared them-But
          apparently-that's not the problem.
          At all. Actually, I've heard it's
          like acupuncture- you're- on your
          back the whole time and you don't
          even feel it go in. That's what my
          ex-girlfriend told me before she
          started dating my father.
          Vanessa and Alvin laugh, Vanessa covers her head with-her
          hand.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Actually they're getting married.

          I don't know. I-think the. simplest
          answer is: I'm a jerk. And--the.
          other answer is: Because - at -some
          point, we forgot how to make each
          other laugh.. And if that-sounds
          like a bullshit answer, you're
          probably right. But if it 'sounds

          Adam goes. to the TV in the waiting room, reaches up and-
          changes the channel away from "The Price is Right."

                         NURSE
          You can't change the channel-..
          Adam gets it on Channel 27- it's Bambi.

                         ADAM

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Fuck. Bambi. Fuck.

                         NURSE
          What's wrong with Bambi?
          Adam runs out of the waiting room, as Dr. Metzner'watches him
          go.' There's a little regret in ï¿½ his .face. Nurse is glued ,to
          the TV. - s

                         NURSE (CONT'D)
          Have you ever eaten deer? It's
          pretty good.

          INT. EMMA'S HALLWAY- DAY

          Adam standing outside Emma's door: Knocks. Knocks. He puts
          his head on the door.

                         ADAM

                         (SOFT)
          please..
          Emma opens the door. She's been crying for hours. She ldoks
          wild, raw, a hurt animal. They stare at each other from;
          either side: of the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          121.

                         EMMA
          My dad.

                         ADAM
          I know.

          EMMA.
          Bambi.

                         ADAM
          I- know.

                         EMMA
          (after a beat)
          if you come in here, you're never
          .leaving.
          Adam steps inside, takes her-in his arms, she really starts
          to sob.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)

                         (SOBBING)
          He's just.a baby deer.

                         ADAM
          I know, he's a little baby deer.
          He just holds her. He starts crying too. They are both
          crying.

                         EMMA
          Are you crying?

                         ADAM
          Yeah.

                         EMMA
          why. are you crying?

                         -ADAM
          I don't know.
          They hold each other.in the doorway, crying. He hands her the
          rubber chicken., she takes it, still crying.

          INT. EM'S HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER

          They're still standing in the doorway, crying.

                         ADAM
          ,Are you good?-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          122.

                         EMMA
          i think so.
          Emma starts crying again.

          EMMA (CONT'D)
          I thought I-was done.

                         ADAM
          That's okay, that's.okay..
          She holds' onto him. He starts crying again too.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Oh crap.
          They hold onto each other, crying ridiculously hard.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          What's after Bambi?: I brought.
          Schindler's List.

                         EMMA
          I don't know if I can do it.

                         ADAM
          You can do it.

                         EMMA
          'oh god- I can't do it-.
          Emma starts kissing him. He kisses her back,

          INT. EMMA'S HOUSE- NIGHT- MOMENTS LATER

          Clothes, blankets, shoes, socks, a 'rubber , chicken.' On the TV
          Screen, grown--up Bambi is .eating a branch. 'Emma and. Adam are
          kissing tenderly. The crying has stopped for now.

                         EMMA
          'Do you think we'.re the only people,
          .who've' ever fucked 'while watching
          Bambi?

                         ADAM
          -Yes. The only ones not in jail.
          .She laughs.-He kisses her some more.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123..

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          You know what I want to doh I want
          to buy light bulbs with different
          wattage so I.can see you in.every
          kind of light.

                         EMMA
          I'm gonna: Make you do push-ups when
          yourre old so your-heart stays
          healthy.

                         ADAM
          I'm gonna- I'm gonna build you a
          log cabin.

                         EMMA

                         (SMILING)
          I don't want toa log cabin.

                         ADAM
          We're gonna break all those rules.

                         EMMA
          Not the one about calling-me ia the
          middle of the day.

                         ADAM
          Not that one. But the one about
          peeing, in front of you. I.'m gonna
          do that whenever I can.
          Emma laughs and cries.

                         EMMA
          I'm so - glad you're alive.

                         ADAM
          Are you glad I'm making this face?
          Adam makes a funny face. Emma laughs.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm totally, completely, -
          ridiculously in love with you-
          Adam kisses-down.-her stomach, she laughs, happy, it feels
          good... then she turns and sees the'TV screen where'Thumper
          thumping his leg.

                         EMMA
          Turn Bambi off- turn Bambi off-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          124..

          INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM- THE NEXT MORNING.

          Like the first scene, we are looking at -them-in bed, from'
          above. But this' time, they are asleep, wrapped in each
          other's arms. I don't know if it's spooning,:but-it's
          something tangled. Light is coming in the window. Adam opens
          his eyes-and looks. at the sleeping Emna. He leans his head
          'down to hers. 

                         ADAM
          Hey.'

                         EMMA
          (still with her eyes

                         CLOSED)
          Hey.

                         ADAM

                         (WHISPEREDR TENDER)
          What are we going to have for
          breakfast?
          Emma, still half-asleep, smiles.

          EMMA.
          Bacon.

                         ADAM

                         (WHISPERED)
          I'm going to get you so 'much
          bacon...
          Thankfully,'we don't have to see that. Fade to black-as'we
          hear some amazing song, in my head it's "You'Ain't Goin'
          -Nowhere. ".

  Title

  EXT. VARIOUS DAYS

  'She' plays through the credits.

  Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our
  time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of
  glamour and sophistication and mystery.

  EXT. STREET - DAY

  Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We
  follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of
  bread.  It is spring.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    Of course, I've seen her films and
    always thought she was, well,
    fabulous -- but, you know,
    million miles from the world I live
    in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill
    -- not a bad place to be...

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  It's a full fruit market day.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    There's the market on weekdays,
    selling every fruit and vegetable
    known to man...

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  A man in denims exits the tattoo studio.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    The tattoo parlour -- with a guy
    outside who got drunk and now can't
    remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    The racial hair-dressers where
    everyone comes out looking like the
    Cookie Monster, whether they like
    it or not...

  Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    Then suddenly it's the weekend, and
    from break of day, hundreds of stalls
    appears out of nowhere, filling
    Portobello Road right up to Notting
    Hill Gate...

  A frantic crowded Portobello market.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... and thousands of people buy
    millions of antiques, some genuine...

  The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained
  glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes
  and saints.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... and some not so genuine.

  EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    And what's great is that lots of
    friends have ended up in this part of
    London -- that's Tony, architect
    turned chef, who recently invested
    all the money he ever earned in a new
    restaurant...

  Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,
  the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge
  fresh salmon.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    So this is where I spend my days
    and years -- in this small village in
    the middle of a city -- in a house
    with a blue door that my wife and I
    bought together... before she left
    me for a man who looked like Harrison
    Ford, only even handsomer...

  We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... and where I now lead a strange
    half-life with a lodger called...

  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY

        WILLIAM
    Spike!

  The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two-
  bachelor flat.

  Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual
  hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very
  white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears
  only shorts.

        SPIKE
    Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me
    with an incredibly important
    decision, could you?

        WILLIAM
    This is important in comparison to,
    let's say, whether they should
    cancel third world debt?

        SPIKE
    That's right -- I'm at last going out
    on a date with the great Janine and I
    just want to be sure I've picked the
    right t-shirt.

        WILLIAM
    What are the choices?

        SPIKE
    Well... wait for it...
      (He pulls on a t-shirt)
    First there's this one...

  The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien
  coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love
  Blood.'

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- might make it hard to strike a
    really romantic note.

        SPIKE
    Point taken.

  He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...

        SPIKE
    I suspect you'll prefer the next one.

  And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,
  pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'

        SPIKE
    Cool, huh?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- she might think you don't have
    true love on your mind.

        SPIKE
    Wouldn't want that...
      (and back up he goes)
    Okay -- just one more.

  He comes down wearing it.  Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the
  most beautiful woman in the world.'

        WILLIAM
    Well, yes, that's perfect. Well
    done.

        SPIKE
    Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.

        WILLIAM
    Good luck.

  Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly.  Revealing that on the
  back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written
  'Fancy a fuck?'

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    And so it was just another hopeless
    Wednesday, as I set off through the
    market to work, little suspecting
    that this was the day which would
    change my life forever.  This is
    work, by the way, my little travel
    book shop...

  A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'

        WILLIAM (V.O.)
    ... which, well, sells travel books
    -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
    always sell many of those.

  William enters.

  INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

  It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
  with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
  Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
  He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without
  cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the
  desk.

        WILLIAM
    Classic.  Absolutely classic.
    Profit from major sales push -- minus
    $B!r(J347.

        MARTIN
    Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the
    pain.

        WILLIAM
    Yes, better get me a half.  All I can
    afford.

        MARIN
    I get your logic.  Demi-capu coming up.

  He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
  We only just glimpse her.

  Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees
  something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause...

        WILLIAM
    Can I help you?

  It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
  in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
  When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.

        ANNA
    No, thanks.  I'll just look around.

        WILLIAM
    Fine.

  She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
  quite smart coffee table book.

        WILLIAM
    That book's really not good -- just
    in case, you know, browsing turned to
    buying.  You'd be wasting your money.

        ANNA
    Really?

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  This one though is... very
    good.

  He picks up a book on the counter.

        WILLIAM
    I think the man who wrote it has
    actually been to Turkey, which helps.
    There's also a very amusing incident
    with a kebab.

        ANNA
    Thanks.  I'll think about it.

  William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
  beside him.

        WILLIAM
    If you could just give me a second.

  Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
  approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.

        WILLIAM
    Excuse me.

        THIEF
    Yes.

        WILLIAM
    Bad news.

        THIEF
    What?

        WILLIAM
    We've got a security camera in this
    bit of the shop.

        THIEF
    So?

        WILLIAM
    So, I saw you put that book down your
    trousers.

        THIEF
    What book?

        WILLIAM
    The one down your trousers.

        THIEF
    I haven't got a book down my trousers.

        WILLIAM
    Right -- well, then we have something
    of an impasse.  I tell you what --
    I'll call the police -- and,  what can
    I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole
    book-down-the-trousers scenario, I
    really apologize.

        THIEF
    Okay -- what if I did have a book down
    my trousers?

        WILLIAM
    Well, ideally, when I went back to
    the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan
    guide to Bali from your trousers, and
    either wipe it and put it back, or
    buy it.  See you in a sec.

  He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does
  William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
  shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has
  observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry about that...

        ANNA
    No, that's fine.  I was going to
    steal one myself but now I've changed
    my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.

        WILLIAM
    Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you
    can find an unsigned copy, it's
    worth an absolute fortune.

  She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.

        THIEF
    Excuse me.

        ANNA
    Yes.

        THIEF
    Can I have your autograph?

        ANNA
    What's your name?

        THIEF
    Rufus.

  She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.

        THIEF
    What does it say?

        ANNA
    Well, that's the signature -- and
    above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
    belong in jail.'

        THIEF
    Nice one.  Would you like my phone
    number?

        ANNA
    Tempting but... no, thank you.

  Thief leaves.

        ANNA
    I think I will try this one.

  She hands William a $B!r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
  He talks as he handles the transaction.

        WILLIAM
    Oh -- right -- on second thoughts
    maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually
    -- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
    None of those childish kebab
    stories you get in so many travel
    books these days.  And I'll throw in
    one of these for free.

  He drops in one of the signed books.

        WILLIAM
    Very useful for lighting fires,
    wrapping fish, that sort of things.

  She looks at him with a slight smile.

        ANNA
    Thanks.

  And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little
  dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.

        MARTIN
    Cappuccino as ordered.

        WILLIAM
    Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe
    who was just in here.

        MARTIN
    Who?  Someone famous?

  But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.

        WILLIAM
    No. No-one -- no-one.

  They set about drinking their coffees.

        MARTIN
    Would be exciting if someone famous
    did come into the shop though,
    wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is
    pretty incredible actually -- I once
    saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think
    it was Ringo.  It might have been
    that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
    Toppy.

        WILLIAM
    Topol.

        MARTIN
    That's right -- Topol.

        WILLIAM
    But Ringo Starr doesn't look
    anything like Topol.

        MARTIN
    No, well... he was quite a long way
    away.

        WILLIAM
    So it could have been neither of them?

        MARTIN
    I suppose so.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes,
    is it?

        MARTIN
    Not classic, no.

  Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.


        WILLIAM
    Right -- want another one?

        MARTIN
    Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy --
    I'll have an orange juice.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  William sets off.

  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

  William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park
  Road.

  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

  William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
  Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange
  juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.

        ANNA
    Oh Jesus.

        WILLIAM
    Here, let me help.

  He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
  far too near her breasts in the panic of it...

        ANNA
    What are you doing?!

  He jumps back.

        WILLIAM
    Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just
    over the street -- you could get
    cleaned up.

        ANNA
    No thank you.  I need to get my car
    back.

        WILLIAM
    I also have a phone.  I'm confident
    that in five minutes we can have you
    spick and span and back on the street
    again... in the non-prostitute sense
    obviously.

  In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
  genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him.

        ANNA
    Okay.  So what does 'just over the
    street' mean -- give it to me in yards.

        WILLIAM
    Eighteen yards.  That's my house
    there.

  He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down.
  She looks up at him.

  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

  They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.

        WILLIAM
    Come on in.  I'll just...

  William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes
  under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of
  breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen.

        WILLIAM
    It's not that tidy, I fear.

  And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books
  from her...

        WILLIAM
    The bathroom is right at the top of
    the stairs and there's a phone on the
    desk up there.

  She heads upstairs.

  INT. KITCHEN - DAY

  William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on
  the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black
  top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He
  is dazzled by the sight of her.

        WILLIAM
    Would you like a cup of tea before
    you go?

        ANNA
    No thanks.

        WILLIAM
    Coffee?

        ANNA
    No.

        WILLIAM
    Orange juice -- probably not.

  He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.

        WILLIAM
    Something else cold -- coke, water,
    some disgusting sugary drink
    pretending to have something to do
    with fruits of the forest?

        ANNA
    Really, no.

        WILLIAM
    Would you like something to nibble --
    apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
    why, no one knows -- because it stops
    them tasting of apricots, and makes
    them taste like honey, and if you
    wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
    instead of apricots, but nevertheless
    -- there we go -- yours if you want
    them.

        ANNA
    No.

        WILLIAM
    Do you always say 'no' to everything?

  Pause.  She looks at him deep.

        ANNA
    No.
      (pause)
    I better be going.  Thanks for your
    help.

        WILLIAM
    You're welcome and, may I also say...
    heavenly.

  It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth-
  talking man.

        WILLIAM
    Take my one chance to say it.  After
    you've read that terrible book,
    you're certainly not going to be
    coming back to the shop.

  She smiles.  She's cool.

        ANNA
    Thank you.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.

  He guides her towards the door.

        WILLIAM
    Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.

  In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He
  closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then...

        WILLIAM
    'Surreal but nice.'  What was I
    thinking?

  ... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along
  the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves
  back, casually...

        WILLIAM
    Coming.

  He opens the door.  It's her.

        WILLIAM
    Oh hi.  Forget something?

        ANNA
    I forgot my bag.

        WILLIAM
    Oh right.

  He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping
  bag.  Then returns and hands it to her.

        WILLIAM
    Here we go.

        ANNA
    Thanks.  Well...

  They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time
  saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans
  forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the
  strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.

        WILLIAM
    I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
    comment.  Disaster...

        ANNA
    Don't worry about it.  I thought the
    apricot and honey business was the
    real lowpoint.

  Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.

        WILLIAM
    Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry --
    there's no excuse for him.

  Spike walks in.

        SPIKE
    Hi.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        WILLIAM
    Hi.

  Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.

        SPIKE
    I'm just going to go into the kitchen
    to get some food -- and then I'm going
    to tell you a story that will make your
    balls shrink to the size of raisins.

  And leaves them in the corridor.

        ANNA
    Probably best not tell anyone about
    this.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell
    myself sometimes but... don't worry
    -- I won't believe it.

        ANNA
    Bye.

  And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike
  comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a
  styrofoam container with a spoon.

        SPIKE
    There's something wrong with this
    yogurt.

        WILLIAM
    It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.

        SPIKE
    Well, there you go.
      (takes another big spoonful)
    On for a video fest tonight?  I've
    got some absolute classic.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  The lights are off.  William and Spike on the couch, just the
  light from the TV playing on their faces.  Cut to the TV full
  screen.  There is Anna.  She is in a stylish Woody Allen type
  modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white.

  INT. MANHATTAN ART GALLERY - DAY

  Anna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery
  with her famous co-star, Michael.  They should be the perfect
  couple, but there is tension.  Anna is not happy.

        MICHAEL
    Smile.

        ANNA
    No.

        MICHAEL
    Smile.

        ANNA
    I've got nothing to smile about.

        MICHAEL
    Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to
    ask you to marry me.

  And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        SPIKE
    Imagine -- somewhere in the world
    there's a man who's allowed to kiss
    her.

        WILLIAM
    Yes, she is fairly fabulous.

  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

  The next day.  William and Martin quietly co-existing.  An annoy-
  ing customer enters.  Mr. Smith.

        MR. SMITH
    Do you have any books by Dickens?

        WILLIAM
    No, we're a travel bookshop.  We only
    sell travel books.

        MR. SMITH
    Oh right.  How about that new John
    Grisham thriller?

        WILLIAM
    No, that's a novel too.

        MR. SMITH
    Oh right.  Have you got a copy of
    'Winnie the Pooh'?

  Pause.

        WILLIAM
    Martin -- your customer.

        MARTIN
    Can I help you?

  William looks up.  At that moment the entire window is suddenly
  taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and
  entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film,
  'Helix.'

  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY

  William heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing
  full body scuba diving gear.

        SPIKE
    Hey.

        WILLIAM
    Hi...

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

  The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.

        WILLIAM
    Just incidentally -- why are you
    wearing that?

        SPIKE
    Ahm -- combination of factors really.
    No clean clothes...

        WILLIAM
    There never will be, you know, unless
    you actually clean your clothes.

        SPIKE
    Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was
    like rooting around in your things,
    and found this, and I thought -- cool.
    Kind of spacey.

  EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY

  The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.
  William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and
  the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather
  wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.

        SPIKE
    There's something wrong with the
    goggles though...

        WILLIAM
    No, they were prescription, so I could
    see all the fishes properly.

        SPIKE
    Groovy.  You should do more of this
    stuff.

        WILLIAM
    So -- any messages?

        SPIKE
    Yeh, I wrote a couple down.

        WILLIAM
    Two?  That's it?

        SPIKE
    You want me to write down all your
    messages?

  William closes his eyes in exasperation.

        WILLIAM
    Who were the ones you didn't write
    down from?

        SPIKE
    Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone
    completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was --
    one from your mum: she said don't
    forget lunch and her leg's hurting
    again.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  No one else?

        SPIKE
    Absolutely not.

  Spike leans back and relaxes.

        SPIKE
    Though if we're going for this
    obsessive writing-down-all-messages
    thing -- some American girl called
    Anna called a few days ago.

  William freezes -- then looks at Spike.

        WILLIAM
    What did she say?

        SPIKE
    Well, it was genuinely bizarre...
    she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then
    she said, call me at the Ritz -- and
    then gave herself a completely
    different name.

        WILLIAM
    Which was?

        SPIKE
    Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one
    name's bad enough...

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

  William on the phone.  We hear the formal man at the other end of
  the phone.  And then intercut with him.

        WILLIAM
    Hello.

        RITZ MAN (V.O.)
    May I help you, sir?

        WILLIAM
    Ahm, look this is a very odd
    situation.  I'm a friend of Anna
    Scott's -- and she rang me at home the
    day before yesterday -- and left a
    message saying she's staying with
    you...

  INT. RITZ RECEPTION - DAY

        RITZ MAN
    I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of
    that name here, sir.

        WILLIAM
    No, that's right -- I know that.  She
    said she's using another name -- but
    the problem is she left the message
    with my flatmate, which was a serious
    mistake.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM

        WILLIAM (cont'd)
    Imagine if you will the stupidest
    person you've ever met -- are you
    doing that...?

  Spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot.  He's read-
  ing a newspaper.

        RITZ MAN
    Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.

        WILLIAM
    And then double it -- and that is the
    -- what can I say -- git I'm living
    with and he cannot remember...

        SPIKE
    Try 'Flintstone.'

        WILLIAM
      (to Spike)
    What?

        SPIKE
    I think she said her name was
    'Flintstone.'

        WILLIAM
    Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to
    you?

        RITZ MAN
    I'll put you right through, sir.

  Flintstone is indeed the magic word.

        WILLIAM
    Oh my God.

  He practices how to sound.

        WILLIAM
    Hello.  Hi.  Hi.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Hi.

  We hear her voice -- don't see her.

        WILLIAM
      (caught out)
    Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We,
    ahm I work in a bookshop.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    You played it pretty cool here,
    waiting for three days to call.

        WILLIAM
    No, I've never played anything cool
    in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll
    stab to death later, never gave me the
    message.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Oh -- Okay.

        WILLIAM
    Perhaps I could drop round for tea or
    something?

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Yeh -- unfortunately, things are
    going to be pretty busy, but... okay,
    let's give it a try.  Four o'clock
    could be good.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Great.
      (he hangs up)
    Classic.  Classic.

  EXT. RITZ - DAY

  William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a
  small bunch of roses.

  INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY

  He approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and
  the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young
  man.  His name is Tarquin.

        WILLIAM
    Which floor?

        TARQUIN
    Three.

  William pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close.

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY

  The lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms
  30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right.
  So does Tarquin.

  William is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So
  does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points
  at the number.

        WILLIAM
    Are you sure you...?

        TARQUIN
    Yes.

        WILLIAM
    Oh.  Right.

  He knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.

        KAREN
    Hello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things
    are running a bit late.  Here's the
    thing...

  She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits,
  with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.'

  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY

  A few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There
  are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.

        KAREN
    What did you think of the film?

        TARQUIN
    Marvellous.  'Close Encounters'
    meets 'Jean De Florette.'  Oscar-
    winning stuff.

  They both turn to William for his opinion.

        WILLIAM
    I agree.

        KAREN
    I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what
    magazines you're from.

        TARQUIN
    'Time Out.'

        KAREN
    Great.  And you...

        WILLIAM
      (seeing it on a coffee
       table)
    'Horse and Hound.'  The name's
    William Whacker.  I think she might
    be expecting me.

        KAREN
    Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.

  They sit down as Karen goes off.

        TARQUIN
    You've brought her flowers?

  William goes for the cover-up.

        WILLIAM
    No -- they're... for my grandmother.
    She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought
    I'd kill two birds with one stone.

        TARQUIN
    I'm sorry.  Which hospital?

  Pause.  He's in trouble.

        WILLIAM
    Do you mind me not saying -- it's a
    rather distressing disease and the
    name of the hospital rather gives it
    away.

        TARQUIN
    Oh sure.  Of course.

        KAREN
    Mr. Thacker.

  Saved by the bell.

  INT. TRAFALGAR SUIT CORRIDOR - DAY

        KAREN
    You've got five minutes.

  He is shown in through big golden doors.  Karen stays outside.

  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY

  There Anna is, framed in the window.  Glorious.

        WILLIAM
    Hi.

        ANNA
    Hello.

        WILLIAM
    I brought these, but clearly...

  There are lots of other flowers in the room.

        ANNA
    Oh no, ho -- these are great.

  A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know each
  other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry about not ringing back.  The
    whole two-names concept was totally too
    much for my flatman's pea-sized
    intellect.

        ANNA
    No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I
    always choose a cartoon character --
    last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.

  At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in.  A fairly grave,
  authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.

        JEREMY
    Everything okay?

        ANNA
    Yes, thanks.

        JEREMY
    And you are from 'Horse and Hound'
    magazine?

  William nods.

        ANNA
    Is that so?

  William shrugs his shoulders.  Jeremy settles at a little desk
  in the corner and makes notes.  A pause.  William feels he has to
  act the part.  They sit in chairs opposite each other.

        WILLIAM
    So I'll just fire away, shall I?

  Anna nods.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Ahm... the film's great...
    and I just wondered -- whether you
    ever thought of having more...
    horses in it?

        ANNA
    Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to
    -- but it was difficult, obviously,
    being set in space.

        WILLIAM
    Obviously.  Very difficult.

  Jeremy leaves.

  William puts his head in his hands.  He was panic.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they
    thrust this thing into my hand -- I
    didn't know what to do.

        ANNA
    No, it's my fault, I thought this
    would all be over by now.  I just
    wanted to sort of apologize for the
    kissing thing.  I seriously don't
    know what got in to me.  I just wanted
    to make sure you were fine about it.

        WILLIAM
    Absolutely fine about it.

  Re-enter Jeremy.

        JEREMY
    Do remember that Miss Scott is also
    keen to talk about her next project,
    which is shooting later in the summer.

        WILLIAM
    Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses
    in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our
    readers are equally intrigued by both
    species.
        ANNA
    It takes place on a submarine.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  Right... But if there were horses,
    would you be riding them yourself or
    would you be getting a stunt horse person
    double sort of thing?

  Jeremy exits.

        WILLIAM
    I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry.
    This is the sort of thing that happens
    in dreams -- not in real life.  Good
    dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to
    see you.

        ANNA
    And what happens next in the dream?

  It's a challenge.

        WILLIAM
    Well, I suppose in the dream dream
    scenario.  I just... ahm, change my
    personality, because you can do that
    in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the
    girl but you know it'll never happen.

  Pause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy
  enters.

        JEREMY
    Time's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was
    so short.  Did you get what you wanted?

        WILLIAM
    Very nearly.

        JEREMY
    Maybe time for one last question?

        WILLIAM
    Right.

  Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.

        WILLIAM
    Are you busy tonight?

        ANNA
    Yes.

  They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists
  in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.

        ANNA
    Well, it was nice to meet you.
    Surreal but nice.

        WILLIAM
    Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's'
    favorite actress.  You and Black
    Beauty.  Tied.

  INT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAY

  William exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  Tarquin
  is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.

        TARQUIN
    How was she?

        WILLIAM
    Fabulous.

        TARQUIN
    Wait a minute -- she took your
    grandmother's flowers?

  William can't think his way out of this.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  That's right.  Bitch.

  He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen.

        KAREN
    If you'd like to come with me we can
    rush you through the others.

        WILLIAM
    The others?

  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

        KAREN
    Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'

  A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes
  William's hand.

        MALE LEAD
    Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the
    film?

        WILLIAM
    Ah... yes, enormously.

        MALE LEAD
    Well, fire away.

        WILLIAM
    Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy
    making the film?

        MALE LEAD
    I did.

        WILLIAM
    Any bit in particular?

        MALE LEAD
    Well, you tell me which bit you liked
    most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed
    making it.

        WILLIAM
    Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in
    space very much.  Did you enjoy
    making  that bit?

  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

  Same room same seat, minutes later, with a monolingual foreign
  actor and an interpreter.

        WILLIAM
    Did you identify with the character
    you were playing?

        INTERPRETER
    Te identicaste con el personaje que
    interpretabas?

        FOREIGN ACTOR
    No.

        INTERPRETER
    No.

        WILLIAM
    Ah.  Why not?

        INTERPRETER
    Por que no?

        FOREIGN ACTOR
    Porque es un robot carnivoro
    psicopata.

        INTERPRETER
    Because he is playing a psychopathic
    flesh-eating robot.

        WILLIAM
    Classic.

  INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

  And now William is sitting opposite an eleven-year-old American
  girl.

        WILLIAM
    Is this your first film?

        GIRL
    No -- it's my 22nd.

        WILLIAM
    Of course it is.  Any favourite among
    the 22?

        GIRL
    Working with Leonardo.

        WILLIAM
    Da Vinci?

        GIRL
    Di Caprio.

        WILLIAM
    Of course.  And is he your favourite
    Italian film director?

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY

  William emerges traumatized into the corridor.  It is full of
  camera crews.  And there is Karen.

        KAREN
    Mr. Thacker?

        WILLIAM
      (so weary)
    Yes?

        KAREN
    Have you got a moment?

  INT. ANNA'S SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY

  They knock on her door.

        ANNA (V.O.)
    Come in.

  William enters.  A certain nervousness.  They are alone again.

        ANNA
    Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight
    -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told
    them I had to spend the evening with
    Britain's premier equestrian
    journalist.

        WILLIAM
    Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no --
    shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's
    birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be
    having dinner.

        ANNA
    Okay -- fine.

        WILLIAM
    But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.

        ANNA
    No, I mean, if it's fine with you,
    I'll, you know, be your date.

        WILLIAM
    You'll be my date at my little sister's
    birthday party?

        ANNA
    If that's all right.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sure it's all right.  My friend
    Max is cooking and he's acknowledged
    to be the worst cook in the world, but
    you know, you could hide the food in
    your handbag or something.

        ANNA
    Okay.

        WILLIAM
    Okay.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Bella and Max are in the kitchen.

        MAX
    He's bringing a girl?

        BELLA
    Miracles do happen.

        MAX
    Does the girl have a name?

        BELLA
    He wouldn't say.

        MAX
    Christ, what is going on in there?

  The oven seems to be smoking a little.  Then the bell rings.

        MAX (cont'd)
      Oh God.

  It's bad timing.  Max shoots out of the kitchen.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Max heads for the door impatiently.  He opens it and turns back
  without looking at William and Anna standing there.

        MAX
    Come on in.  Vague food crisis.

  William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Bella is there.

        BELLA
    Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is
    proving more complicated than
    expected.

        WILLIAM
    He's cooking guinea fowl?

        BELLA
    Don't even ask.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        BELLA
    Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting
    image of...

        WILLIAM
    Bella -- this is Anna.

        BELLA
    Right.
      (pause)

        MAX
    Okay.  Crisis over.

  He rises from his stove position.

        WILLIAM
    Max.  This is Anna.

        MAX
    Hello, Anna ahm...
      (He recognizes her -- the
       word just falls out)
    Scott -- have some wine.

        ANNA
    Thank you.

  Door bell goes.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Max opens the door -- it is Honey.

        MAX
    Hi.

  She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.

        MAX
    Yes, Happy Birthday.

  They head back along the corridor.

        MAX
    Look, your brother has brought this
    girl, and ahm...

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  They enter the kitchen.

        HONEY
    Hi guys.
      (sees Anna)
    Oh holy fuck.

        WILLIAM
    Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is
    Honey -- she's my baby sitter.

        ANNA
    Hiya.

        HONEY
    Oh God this is one of those key moments
    in life, when it's possible you can be
    really, genuinely cool -- and I'm going
    to fail a hundred percent.  I absolutely
    and totally and utterly adore you and I
    think you're the most beautiful woman
    in the world and more importantly I
    genuinely believe and have believed for
    some time now that we can be best
    friends.  What do you think?

        ANNA
    Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know
    -- lucky me.  Happy Birthday.

  She hands her a present.

        HONEY
    Oh my God.  You gave me a present.
    We're best friends already.  Marry
    Will -- he's a really nice guy and
    then we can be sisters.

        ANNA
    I'll think about it.

  The front door bell goes.

        MAX
    That'll be Bernie.

  He heads out into the corridor to the front door.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Max opens the door.

        MAX
    Hello, Bernie.

        BERNIE
    I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up
    at work again, I fear.  Millions down
    the drain.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  They enter the room.

        MAX
    Bernie -- this is Anna.

        BERNIE
    Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.

  Doesn't recognize her -- turns to Honey.

        BERNIE
    Honey Bunny -- happy birthday to you.
      (hands her a present)
    It's a hat.  You don't have to wear
    it or anything.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  A minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before
  dinner.  Bernie with Anna on their own -- William helping Max in
  the kitchen.

        MAX
    You haven't slept with her, have you?

        WILLIAM
    That is a cheap question and the answer
    is, of course, no comment.

        MAX
    'No comment' means 'yes.'

        WILLIAM
    No, it doesn't.

        MAX
    Do you ever masturbate?

        WILLIAM
    Definitely no comment.

        MAX
    You see -- it means 'yes.'

  Then on to Bernie's conversation.

        BERNIE
    So tell me Anna -- what do you do?

        ANNA
    I'm an actress.

        BERNIE
    Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock-
    market, so not really similar fields,
    though I have done some amateur stuff
    -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce,
    all that.  'Ooh -- careful there,
    vicar.'  Always imagined it's a
    pretty tough job, though, acting.
    I mean the wages are a scandal,
    aren't they?

        ANNA
    Well, they can be.

        BERNIE
    I see friends from university --
    clever chaps -- been in the business
    longer than you -- they're scraping
    by on seven, eight thousand a year.
    It's no life.  What sort of acting
    do you do?

        ANNA
    Films mainly.

        BERNIE
    Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the
    pay in movies?  I mean, last film you
    did, what did you get paid?

        ANNA
    Fifteen million dollars.

        BERNIE
    Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly
    good.  On the high side... have you
    tried the nuts?

        MAX
    Right -- I think we're ready.

  They all move towards the kitchen.

        ANNA
      (to Bella)
    I wonder if you could tell me where
    the...?

        BELLA
    Oh, it's just down the corridor on
    the right.

        HONEY
    I'll show you.

  A moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the
  others all turn to William.

        BELLA
    Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly
    what are you doing here with Anna
    Scott?

        BERNIE
    Anna Scott?

        BELLA
    Yes.

        BERNIE
    The movie star?

        BELLA
    Yup.

        BERNIE
    Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.

  The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds.
  Honey re-enters.

        HONEY
    I don't believe it.  I walked into the
    loo with her.  I was still talking when
    she started unbuttoning her jeans...
    She had to ask me to leave.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  A little later.  They are sat at dinner.  Bella next to Anna.

        BELLA
    What do you think of the guinea fowl?

        ANNA
      (whispering)
    I'm a vegetarian.

        BELLA
    Oh God.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Moving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they
  eat dinner.  A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna
  is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.
  And there's a cake.  Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat.  Anna
  watches William laughing at something and then putting his head
  in his hands with mock shame.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Coffee time.

        MAX
    Having you here, Anna, firmly
    establishes what I've long suspected,
    that we really are the most desperate
    hot of under-achievers.

        BERNIE
    Shame!

        MAX
    I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in
    fact, I think it's something we should
    take pride in.  I'm going to give the
    last brownie as a prize to the saddest
    act here.

  A little pause.  Then William turns to Bernie.

        WILLIAM
    Bernie.

        BERNIE
    Well, obviously it's me, isn't it --
    I work in the City in a job I don't
    understand and everyone keeps getting
    promoted above me.  I haven't had a
    girlfriends since... puberty and,
    well, the long and short of it is,
    nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks
    get any chubbier, they never will.

        HONEY
    Nonsense.  I fancy you.  Or I did
    before you got so far.

        MAX
    You see -- and unless I'm much mistaken,
    your job still pays you rather a lot of
    money, while Honey here, she earns
    nothing flogging her guts out at
    London's seediest record store.

        HONEY
    Yes.  And I don't have hair -- I've got
    feathers, and I've got funny goggly
    eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and
    ... no one'll ever marry me because my
    boosies have actually started
    shrinking.

        MAX
    You see -- incredibly sad.

        BELLA
    On the other hand, her best friend is
    Anna Scott.

        HONEY
    That's true, I can't deny it.  She
    needs me, what can I say?

        BELLA
    And most of her limbs work.  Whereas
    I'm stuck in its thing day and night,
    in a house full of ramps.  And to add
    insult to serious injury -- I've
    totally given up smoking, my favourite
    thing, and the truth is... we can't
    have a baby.

  Dead silence.

        WILLIAM
    Bella.

  Bella shrugs her shoulders.  Bernie is totally grief-struck.

        BERNIE
    No.  Not true...

        BELLA
    C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots
    of ways, but... Surely it's worth a
    brownie.

  William reaches for her hand.  Max breaks the sombre mood.

        MAX
    Well, I don't know.  Look at
    William.  Very unsuccessful
    professionally.  Divorced.  Used to
    be handsome, now kind of squidgy
    around the edges -- and absolutely
    certain never to hear from Anna again
    after she's heard that his nickname
    at school was Floppy.

  They all laugh.  Anna smiles across at William.

        WILLIAM
    So I get the brownie?

        MAX
    I think you do, yes.

        ANNA
    Wait a minute.  What about me?

        MAX
    I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the
    brownie?

        ANNA
    Well... a shot at it.

        WILLIAM
    You'll have to prove it.  This is a
    great brownie and I'm going to fight
    for it.  State your claim.

        ANNA
    Well, I've been on a diet since I was
    nineteen, which means basically I've
    been hungry for a decade.  I've had a
    sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one
    of whom hit me: and every time my heart
    gets broken it gets splashed across
    the newspapers as entertainment.
    Meantime, it cost millions to get me
    looking like this...

        HONEY
    Really?

        ANNA
    Really -- and one day, not long from
    now...

  While she says this, quiet settles around the table.  The thing
  is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.

        ANNA
    ... my looks will go, they'll find out
    I can't act and I'll become a sad
    middle-aged woman who looks a bit like
    someone who was famous for a while.

  Silence... they all look at her... then.

        MAX
    Nah!!!  Nice try, gorgeous -- but you
    don't fool anyone.

  The mood is instantly broken.  They all laugh.

        WILLIAM
    Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  Anna and William are leaving.

        ANNA
    That was such a great evening.

        MAX
    I'm delighted.

  He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek.
  He stumbles back with joy.

        ANNA
    And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.

        MAX
    Now you're lying.

        ANNA
    You're right.  I told you I was bad
    at acting.

  Max loves this.

        ANNA
      (to Bella)
    Lovely to meet you.

        BELLA
    And you.  I'll wait till you've gone
    before I tell him you're a
    vegetarian.

        MAX
    No!

        ANNA
    Night, night, Honey.

        HONEY
    I'm so sorry about the loo thing.
    I meant to leave but I just...
    look, ring me if you need someone to
    go shopping with.  I know lots of
    nice, cheap places... not that money
    necessarily...
      (gives up)
    nice to meet you.

  And Honey gives her a huge hug.

        ANNA
    You too -- from now on you are my
    style guru.

  Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity.

        BERNIE
    Love your work.

  They move to the door and wave goodbye.

  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

  William and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive
  and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
  feelings.  William is a little embarrassed.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry -- they always do that when I
    leave the house.

  The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.
  They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence.

        ANNA
    Floppy, huh?

        WILLIAM
    It's the hair!  It's to do with the
    hair.

        ANNA
    Why is she in a wheelchair?

        WILLIAM
    It was an accident -- about eighteen
    months ago.

        ANNA
    And the pregnancy thing -- is that to
    do with the accident?

        WILLIAM
    You know, I'm not sure.  I don't
    think they'd tried for kids before,
    as fate would have it.

  They walk in silence for a moment.  Then...

        WILLIAM
    Would you like to come... my house is
    just...?

  She smiles and shakes her head.

        ANNA
    Too complicated.

        WILLIAM
    That's fine.

        ANNA
    Busy tomorrow?

        WILLIAM
    I thought you were leaving.

        ANNA
    I was.

  EXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHT

  A little later in the walk.

        ANNA
    What's in there?

  They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage
  behind it.

        WILLIAM
    Gardens.  All these streets round
    here have these mysterious communal
    gardens in the middle of them.
    They're like little villages.

        ANNA
    Let's go in.

        WILLIAM
    Ah no -- that's the point -- they're
    private villages -- only the people
    who live round the edges are allowed
    in.

        ANNA
    You abide by rules like that?

        WILLIAM
    Ahm...

  Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on
  the answer to this.

        WILLIAM
    Heck no -- other people do -- but not
    me -- I just do what I want.

  He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite
  make it, and falls back onto the pavement...

        WILLIAM
      (casually)
    Whoopsidaisies.

        ANNA
    What did you say?

        WILLIAM
    Nothing.

        ANNA
    Yes, you did.

        WILLIAM
    No, I didn't.

        ANNA
    You said 'whoopsidaisies.'

  Tiny pause.

        WILLIAM
    I don't think so.  No one has said
    'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean
    unless they're...

        ANNA
    There's no 'unless.'  No one has said
    "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and
    even then it was only little girls
    with blonde ringlets.

        WILLIAM
    Exactly.  Here we go again.

  He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...

        WILLIAM
    Whoopsidaisies.

  They look at each other.

        WILLIAM
    It's a disease I've got -- it's a
    clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and
    having injections -- it won't last
    long.

        ANNA
    Step aside.

  She starts to climb.

        WILLIAM
    Actually be careful Anna -- it's
    harder than it looks...

  But she's already almost over.

        WILLIAM
    Oh no it's not -- it's easy.

  A few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden.

        ANNA
    Come on, Flops.

  William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself
  off, and heads towards where she stands.

        WILLIAM
    Now seriously -- what in the world
    in this garden could make that
    ordeal worthwhile?

  She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
  time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause.

        WILLIAM
    Nice garden.

  EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT

  They walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see
  the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come
  across a single, simple wooden bench.

        ANNA
    'For June, who loved this garden --
    from Joseph who always sat beside
    her.'

  We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She
  doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917
  - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.

        ANNA
    Some people do spend their whole
    lives together.

  He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench,
  looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up
  into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music
  plays.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

  William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.
  He shoots past Spike.

        WILLIAM
    Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have
    you seen my glasses?

        SPIKE
    No, 'fraid not.

        WILLIAM
    Bollocks.
      (still searching --
       with no help from
       Spike)
    This happens every time I go to the
    cinema.  Average day, my glasses are
    everywhere -- everywhere I look,
    glasses.  But the moment I need them
    they disappear.  It's one of life's
    real cruelties.

        SPIKE
    That's compared to, like,
    earthquakes in the Far East or
    testicular cancer?

        WILLIAM
    Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to
    go.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING

  He sprints downstairs, now fully dressed.

        WILLIAM
      (not meaning it)
    Thanks for your help on the glasses
    thing.

        SPIKE
      (sincerely)
    You're welcome.  Did you find them?

        WILLIAM
    Sort of.

  INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

  Mid-film.  We move across the audience.  And there is in the
  middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to
  her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba-
  diving goggles.

  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  A very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William
  sitting, near the end of their meal.

        ANNA
    So who left who?

        WILLIAM
    She left me.

        ANNA
    Why?

        WILLIAM
    She saw through me.

        ANNA
    Uh-oh.  That's not good.

  We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table --
  now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men.

        LAWRENCE
    No - No- No!  Give me Anna Scott any
    day.

  William and Anna look at each other.

        GERALD
    I didn't like that last film of hers.
    Fast asleep from the moment the
    lights went down.

  Again -- Anna reacts.

        LAWRENCE
    Don't really care what the films are
    like.  Any film with her in it --
    fine by me.

        GERALD
    No -- not my type at all really.  I
    prefer that other one -- blonde --
    sweet looking -- has an orgasm every
    time you take her out for a cup of
    coffee.

  Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.'

        LAWRENCE
    Meg Ryan.

  William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.

        GERALD
    Drug-induced, I hear -- I believe
    she's actually in rehab as we speak.

        LAWRENCE
    Whatever, she's so clearly up for it.

  Anna's twinkle fades.

        LAWRENCE
    You know -- some girls, they're all
    'stay away chum' but Anna, she's
    absolutely gagging for it.  Do you
    know that in over fifty percent of
    languages the word for "actress" is
    the same as the word for "prostitute."

  This is horrible.

        LAWRENCE
    And Anna is your definitive actress
    -- someone really filthy you can just
    flip over...

        WILLIAM
    Right, that's it.

  He gets up and goes round the corner to the men.  There are in
  fact four of them, the two meeker men, Gavin and Harry, hanging
  on the other guys' witty words.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sorry to disturb you guys but --

        LAWRENCE
    Can I help you?

        WILLIAM
    Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard
    your conversation -- but I did and I
    just think, you know...

  He's not a very convincing or frightening figure.

        WILLIAM
    ...the person you're talking about
    is a real person and I think she
    probably deserves a little bit more
    consideration, rather than having
    jerks like you drooling over her...

        LAWRENCE
    Oh sod off, mate.  What are you, her
    dad?

  Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without
  being recognized.

        WILLIAM
    I'm sorry.

        ANNA
    No, that's fine.  I love that you
    tried... time was I'd have done the
    same.

  They walk on and then...

        ANNA
    In fact -- give me a second.

  And she walks straight back to their table.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        LAWRENCE
    Oh my God...

        ANNA
    I'm sorry about my friend -- he's
    very sensitive.

        LAWRENCE
    No, look, I'm sorry...

        ANNA
    Please, please -- let's just leave
    it there.  I'm sure you meant no harm,
    and I'm sure it was just friendly
    banter and I'm sure you dicks are all
    the size of peanuts.  A perfect match
    for the size of your brains.  Enjoy
    your meal.  The tuna's really good.

  And she walks away.  Gerald turns to Lawrence.

        GERALD
    You prick.

  EXT. RITZ ARCADE - NIGHT

  They are walking.

        ANNA
    I shouldn't have done that.  I
    shouldn't have done that.

        WILLIAM
    No, you were brilliant

        ANNA
    I'm rash and I'm stupid and what
    am I doing with you?

        WILLIAM
    I don't know, I'm afraid.

        ANNA
    I don't know either.

  They have arrived at the end of the arcade.

        ANNA
    Here we are.
      (pause)
    Do you want to come up?

        WILLIAM
      (he hoes)
    There seem to be lots of reasons
    why I shouldn't.

        ANNA
    There are lots of reasons.  Do you
    want to come up?

  His look says yes.

        ANNA
    Give me five minutes.

  He watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music plays.

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHT

  William coming along the hotel corridor.  He knocks on the
  door.

        ANNA
    Hiya.

  There's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice.

        WILLIAM
    Hi.

  He kisses her gently on the cheek.

        WILLIAM
    To be able to do that is such a
    wonderful thing.

        ANNA
      (pause)
    You've got to go.

        WILLIAM
    Why?

        ANNA
    Because my boyfriend, who I thought
    was in America, is in fact in the
    next room.

        WILLIAM
    Your boyfriend?

  He is duly shocked.  She's trying to be calm.

        ANNA
    Yes...

        JEFF (V.O.)
    Who is it?

  Jeff drifts into view behind.  He is a very famous film star and
  looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  Unshaven, he has
  magic charm, whatever he says.  Over a t-shirt, he wears a
  shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.

        WILLIAM
    Ahm... room service.

        JEFF
    How you doing?  I thought you guys
    all wore those penguin coats.

        WILLIAM
    Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just
    changed to go home -- but I thought
    I'd just deal with this final call.

        JEFF
    Oh great.  Could you do me a favour
    and try to get us some really cold
    water up here?

        WILLIAM
    I'll see what I can do.

        JEFF
    Still, not sparkling.

        WILLIAM
    Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.

        JEFF
    Unless it's illegal in the UK to
    serve liquids below room temperature:
    I don't want you going to jail just
    to satisfy my whims...

        WILLIAM
    No, I'm sure it'll be fine.

        JEFF
    And maybe you could just adios the
    dishes and empty the trash.

        WILLIAM
    Right.

  And he does just that.  Scoops up the two used plates and heads
  to the bin.

        ANNA
    Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure
    this is not his job.

        JEFF
    I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?

        WILLIAM
    Ah -- no.  It's fine.

        JEFF
    What's your name?

        WILLIAM
    Ahm... Bernie.

  Jeff slips him a fiver.

        JEFF
    Thank you, Bernie.
      (to Anna)
    Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty
    surprise?

        ANNA
    Nice surprise.

  He kisses her.

        JEFF
    Liar.
      (to William)
    She hates surprises.  What are you
    ordering?

        ANNA
    I haven't decided.

        JEFF
    Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want
    people saying, 'There goes that
    famous actor with the big, fat
    girlfriend."

  He wanders off taking off his t-shirt.

        WILLIAM
    I better leave.

  Anna just nods.

        WILLIAM
    -- this is a fairly strange reality
    to be faced with.  To be honest, I
    don't realize...

        ANNA
    I'm sorry... I don't know what to
    say.

        WILLIAM
    I think goodbye is traditional.

  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  William walks away.

  EXT. RITZ - NIGHT

  William walks down the arcade outside the hotel.  He is
  stunned.

  EXT. LONDON BUS - NIGHT

  William sits alone on a bus.  We see him through the side
  window.  As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the
  bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  He gets into his room and sits on the bed.

  INT. SPACESHIP - NIGHT

  Space Anna, in the very hi-tech environment and a serious
  moods, fastens the last clasps on her uniform.  She takes a
  helmet type thing, and places it on her head.

  INT. CONNECT CINEMA - NIGHT

  Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.
  It's not full.  The camera moves and finds, sitting on his
  own...William.  Just watching.  We see a momentous flash of
  light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

  William is looking out the window, lost in thought.  Spike
  enters.

        SPIKE
    Come on -- open up -- this is me --
    Spikey -- I'm in contact with some
    quite important spiritual vibrations.
    What's wrong?

  Spike settles on the arm of a chair.  William decides to open
  up a bit...

        WILLIAM
    Well, okay.  There's this girl...

        SPIKE
    Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe.
    Good.  Speak on, dear friend.

        WILLIAM
    She's someone I just can't -- someone
    who... self-evidently can't be mine --
    and it's as if I've taken love-heroin
    -- and now I can't even have it again.
    I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's
    trouble inside.

  Spike nods thoughtfully.

        SPIKE
    Yeh.  Yeh... tricky... tricky... I
    knew a girl at school called Pandora
    ... never got to see her box though.

  He roars with laughter.  William smiles.

        WILLIAM
    Thanks.  Yes -- very helpful.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  Only two tables are being used.  William and his friends are
  on their first course.  Bernie reads an "Evening Standard,"
  with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport.

        MAX
    You didn't know she had a boyfriend?

        WILLIAM
    No -- did you?

  Their looks make it obvious that everyone did.

        WILLIAM
    Bloody hell, I can't believe it --
    my whole life ruined because I don't
    read 'Hello' magazine.

        MAX
    Let's face facts.  This was always a
    no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess
    and you know what happens to mortals
    who get involved with the gods.

        WILLIAM
    Buggered?

        MAX
    Every time.  But don't despair -- I
    think I have the solution to your
    problems.

        WILLIAM
    Really?

  They all look to him for wise words.

        MAX
    Her name is Tessa and she works in
    the contracts department.  The hair,
    I admit, is unfashionable frizzy --
    but she's as bright as a button and
    kisses like a nymphomaniac on death
    row.  Apparently.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  The kitchen.  William is looking uneasy.  A doorbell rings.

        MAX
    Now -- try.

  William nods.  Max heads off to the door.  We stay with William
  -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the
  corridor.

        TESSA (V.O.)
    I got completely lost -- it's real
    difficult, isn't it?  Everything's
    got the word 'Kensington' in it --
    Kensington Park Road, Kensington
    Gardens, Kensington bloody Park
    Gardens...

  They reach the kitchen.  Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.

        MAX
    Tessa -- this is Bella my wife.

        TESSA
    Oh hello, you're in a wheelchair.

        BELLA
    That's right.

        MAX
    And this is William.

        TESSA
    Hello William.  Max has told me
    everything about you.

        WILLIAM
      (frightened)
    Has he?

        MAX
    Wine?

        TESSA
    Oh yes please.  Come on, Willie, let's
    get sloshed.

  She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send
  a message of panic to Bella.  She agrees -- it's bad.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Max walks over to the table.  Honey, Bella, William and another
  girl.

        MAX
    Keziah -- some woodcock?

        KEZIAH
    No, thank you  -- I'm a fruitarian.

        MAX
    I don't realize that.

  It is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the
  pause.

        WILLIAM
    And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?

        KEZIAH
    We believe that fruits and vegetables
    have feelings so we think cooking is
    cruel.  We only eat things that have
    actually fallen from the tree or bush
    -- that are, in fact, dead already.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Right.  Interesting stuff.
      (pause)
    So these carrots...

        KEZIAH
    Have been murdered, yes.

        WILLIAM
    Murdered?  Poor carrots.  How beastly.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

  Time for coffee and chocolates.  Beside William sits the final,
  perfect girl.  She is Rosie, quite young, smartly dressed,
  open-hearted.  It is just Max and William and Bella and her.

        ROSIE
    Delicious coffee.

        MAX
    Thank you.  I'm sorry about the lamb.

        ROSIE
    No -- I thought it was really, you know,
    interesting.

        WILLIAM
    Interesting means inedible.

        ROSIE
    Really inedible -- yes that's right.

  They all laugh.  It's going very well.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  William is with Rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye.

        ROSIE
    Maybe we'll meet again some time.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  That would be... great.

  She kisses him gently on the cheek.  He opens the door -- she
  walks out.  He shuts the door quietly and heads back into the
  living room...

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Max and Bella wait excitedly.

        MAX
    Well?

        WILLIAM
    She's perfect, perfect.

        BELLA
    And?

  William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...

        WILLIAM
    I think you have forgotten...
      (he looks at them)
    what an unusual situation you have
    here -- to find someone you actually
    love, who'll love you -- the chances
    are... always miniscule.  Look at me
    -- not counting the American -- I've
    only loved two girls in my whole life,
    both total disasters.

        MAX
    That's not fair.

        WILLIAM
    No really, one of them marries me and
    then leaves me quicker than you can
    say Indiana Jones -- and the other,
    who seriously ought to have known
    better, casually marries my best
    friend.

        BELLA
      (pause)
    Still loves you though.

        WILLIAM
    In a depressingly asexual way.

        BELLA
      (pause)
    I never fancied you much actually...

  They all roar with laughter.

        BELLA
    I mean I loved you -- you were terribly
    funny.  But all that kissing my ears...

        WILLIAM
    Oh no -- this is just getting worse.
    I am going to find myself, 30 years
    from now, still on this couch.

        BELLA
    Do you want to stay?

        WILLIAM
    Why not -- all that awaits me at home
    is a masturbating Welshman.

  Music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Max lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs.

  Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide
  open -- thinking.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Morning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him
  goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also
  dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her
  briefcase with law books from the kitchen table.

  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

  William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night
  away from home, a heads off.

  EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY

  William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see,
  though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem
  to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front
  page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'
  and 'Scott of Pantartica.'

  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

  William is shaving.  The bell goes.  He heads out to answer it.

  EXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY

  William arrives at the door and opens it.  There stands a dark-
  glassed Anna.

        ANNA
    Hi.  Can I come in?

        WILLIAM
    Come in.

  She moves inside.  Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired.
  Nothing idealized.

  INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

  The two of them.

        ANNA
    They were taken years ago -- I know
    it was... well, I was poor and it
    happens a lot -- that's not an excuse
    -- but to make things worse, it now
    appears someone was filming me as
    well.  So what was a stupid photo-
    shoot now looks like a porno film.
    And well... the pictures have been
    solid and they're everywhere.

  William shakes his head.

        ANNA
    I don't know where to go.  The hotel
    is surrounded.

        WILLIAM
    This is the place.

        ANNA
    Thank you.  I'm just in London for two
    days -- but, with your papers, it's the
    worse place to be.

  She's very shaken.

        ANNA
    These are such horrible pictures.
    They're so grainy... they make me
    look like...

        WILLIAM
    Don't think about it.  We'll sort it
    out.  Now what would you like -- tea
    ... bath...?

        ANNA
    A bath would be great.

  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hear him.
  Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it.

        SPIKE
    Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic
    .... magnificent...

  He heads up the stairs.  Opens the bathroom door, walks in.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

  Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip...

        ANNA
    You must be Spike.

  She's in the bath.  Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the
  bathroom.

  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike calms himself down.  He then opens the bathroom door
  again -- and looks in.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

  Anna is still lying low in the bath.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        SPIKE
    Just checking.

  INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike comes back out into the corridor.  Looks to heaven.

        SPIKE
    Thank you, God.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

  William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking
  tea.

        ANNA
    I'm really sorry about last time.  He
    just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact,
    I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.

        WILLIAM
    No, that's fine.  It's not often one
    has the opportunity to adios the plates
    of a major Hollywood star.  It was a
    thrill for me.
      (she smiles.  Pause)
    How is he?

        ANNA
    I don't know.  It got to the point where
    I couldn't remember any of the reasons
    I loved him.  And you... and love?

        WILLIAM
    Well, there's a question -- without
    an interesting answer.

        ANNA
    I have thought about you.

        WILLIAM
    Oh no no -- no.

  He doesn't think she has to talk about this.

        ANNA
    Just anytime I've tried to keep
    things normal with anyone normal --
    it's been a disaster.

        WILLIAM
    I appreciate that absolutely.
      (changing subject
       tactfully)
    Is that the film you're doing?

        ANNA
    Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.

        WILLIAM
    Would you like me to take you through
    your lines?

        ANNA
    Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.

        WILLIAM
    Hand it over.  Basic plot?

        ANNA
    I'm a difficult but brilliant junior
    officer who in about twenty minutes
    will save the world from nuclear
    disaster.

        WILLIAM
    Well done you.

  EXT. TERRACE - DAY

  A little later.  They're in the thick of the script.

        WILLIAM
    'Message from command.  Would you like
    them to send in the HKs?'

        ANNA
    'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we
    need radar feedback before the KFT's
    return at 19 hundred -- then inform the
    Pentagon that we'll be needing black
    star cover from ten hundred through
    12.15' -- and don't you dare say one
    word about how many mistakes I made in
    that speech or I'll pelt you with
    olives.

        WILLIAM
    'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that
    on straightaway.'

        ANNA
    'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I
    make?

        WILLIAM
    Eleven.

        ANNA
    Damn.  'And Wainwright...'

        WILLIAM
    Cartwright.

        ANNA
    'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever
    your name is, I promised little Jimmy
    I'd be home for his birthday -- could
    you get a message through that I may
    be a little late.'

        WILLIAM
    'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'

        ANNA
    My son's name is Johnny?

        WILLIAM
    Yup.

        ANNA
    Well, get a message through to him
    too.

        WILLIAM
    Brilliant.
      (the scene's over)
    Word perfect I'd say.

        ANNA
    What do you think?

        WILLIAM
    Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's
    not Henry James, but it's gripping.

        ANNA
    You think I should do Henry James
    instead?

        WILLIAM
    I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James.
    But, you know -- this writer's pretty
    damn good too.

        ANNA
    Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone
    in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve
    to say 'inform the Pentagon that we
    need black star cover.'

        WILLIAM
    And I think the book is the poorer for
    it.

  Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.  He is helping.

  INT. WILLIAM'S DINING ROOM

  Anna and William.  Sat down at table.  There's a picture
  hanging on the wall behind.

        ANNA
    I can't believe you have that picture
    on your wall.

  It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple,
  with a goat as company.

        WILLIAM
    You like Chagall?

        ANNA
    I do.  It feels like how being in love
    should be.  Floating through a dark
    blue sky.

        WILLIAM
    With a goat playing a violin.

        ANNA
    Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness
    without a violin-playing goat.

  Spike enters with three pizzas.

        SPIKE
    Voila.  Carnival Calypso, for the
    Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni,
    pineapple and a little more
    pepperoni.

        ANNA
    Fantastic.

        WILLIAM
    I don't mention that Anna's a
    vegetarian, did I?

        SPIKE
      (pause)
    I have some parsnip stew from last week.
    If I just peel the skin off, it'll be
    perfect.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Later in the evening.  William and Anna on their own.  They're
  sipping coffee.  A few seconds of just co-existing.  Anna looks
  up.

        ANNA
    You've got big feet.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.  Always have had.

        ANNA
    You know what they say about men with
    big feet?

        WILLIAM
    No.  What's that?

        ANNA
    Big feet -- large shoes.

  He laughs.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  A few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub.

        ANNA
    The thing that's so irritating is that
    now I'm so totally fierce when it comes
    to nudity clauses.

        WILLIAM
    You actually have clauses in your
    contact about nudity?

        ANNA
    Definitely.  'You may show the dent at
    the top of the artist's buttocks -- but
    neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt
    person being used, the artist must have
    full consultation.'

        WILLIAM
    You have a stunt bottom?

        ANNA
    I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

        WILLIAM
    Would you be tempted to go for a
    slightly better bottom than your own?

        ANNA
    Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.

        WILLIAM
    It's one hell of a job.  What do you put
    on your passport?  Profession -- Mel
    Gibson's bottom.

        ANNA
    Actually, Mel does his own ass work.
    Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.

        WILLIAM
    The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?

        ANNA
    Both.

  INT. WILLIAM'S UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

  They are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top.

        ANNA
    Today has ben a good day.  Which under
    the circumstances is... unexpected.

        WILLIAM
    Well, thank you.
      (awkward pause)
    Anyway -- time for bed.  Or...
    sofa-bed.

        ANNA
    Right.

  Pause.  She leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into
  the bedroom and closes the door.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  William downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet.  Eyes open.
  Thinking.  Pause and pause.

  He waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn.'  But nothing
  happens.  William gets off the sofa decisively.  Sits on the
  side of it.  Then gets back in again.

  Pause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks.  There's
  someone there.

        WILLIAM
      (to himself)
    Oh my God...
      (then...)
    Hello.

        SPIKE
    Hello.  I wonder if I could have a
    little word.

  He drifts round the corner, half-naked.

        WILLIAM
    Spike.

        SPIKE
    I don't want to interfere, or anything
    ... but she's split up from her boy-
    friend, that's right isn't it?

        WILLIAM
    Maybe.

        SPIKE
    And she's in your house.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.

        SPIKE
    And you get on very well.

        WILLIAM
    Yes.

        SPIKE
    Well, isn't this perhaps a good
    opportunity to... slip her one?

        WILLIAM
    Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in
    trouble -- get a grip.

        SPIKE
    Right.  Right.  You think it's the
    wrong moment.  Fair enough.
      (pause)
    Do you mind if I have a go?

        WILLIAM
    Spike!

        SPIKE
    No -- you're right.

        WILLIAM
    I'll talk to you in the morning.

        SPIKE
    Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but
    okay.

  Back to William thinking again.  Dreamy atmosphere.  And then...
  more footsteps on the stairs.

        WILLIAM
    Oh please sod off.

        ANNA
    Okay.

        WILLIAM
    No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were
    someone else.  I thought you were Spike.
    I'm delighted you're not.

  The darkness of the living room.  We see Anna in the shadow.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  A few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middle of
  the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What a
  miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  Then
  he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck by who
  it is.

        WILLIAM
    Wow.

        ANNA
    What?

  And then gets over it straight away.

        WILLIAM
    Nothing.

  And kisses her.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  The middle of the night.  They are both asleep -- a yard apart.
  In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then
  she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right
  next to him.  He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this
  all is.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

  The morning.

        WILLIAM
    It still strikes me as, well, surreal,
    that I'm allowed to see you naked.

        ANNA
    You and every person in this country.

        WILLIAM
    Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.

        ANNA
    What is it about men and nudity?
    Particularly breasts -- how can you be so
    interested in them?

        WILLIAM
    Well...

        ANNA
    No seriously.  I mean, they're just
    breasts.  Every second person in the
    world has got them...

        WILLIAM
    More than that actually, when you think
    about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very
    nice pair...

        ANNA
    But... they're odd-looking.  They're
    for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You
    must have seen a thousand of them --
    what's the fuss about?

        WILLIAM
      (pause)
    Actually, I can't think really -- let
    me just have a quick look...

  He looks under the sheet at her breasts.

        WILLIAM
    No, beats me.

  She laughs...

        ANNA
    Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to
    bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.'
    Do you feel that?

        WILLIAM
    Who was Gilda?

        ANNA
    Her most famous part -- men went to bed
    with the dream -- and they didn't like
    it when they woke up with the reality --
    do you feel that way with me?

        WILLIAM
      (pause)
    You're lovelier this morning than you
    have ever been.

        ANNA
      (very touched)
    Oh.

  She looks at him carefully.  Then leaps out of bed.

        ANNA
    I'll be back.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING

  William on the bed.  The door opens.  It is Anna with a tray of
  toast and tea.

        ANNA
    Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch.

  She heads across.  She smiles and sits on the bed.

        ANNA
    Can I stay a bit longer?

        WILLIAM
    Stay forever.

        ANNA
    Damn, I forgot the jam.

  The doorbell goes.

        ANNA
    You get the door, I'll get the jam.

  INT./EXT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  William heads down the corridor and opens the door.  Outside
  are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and
  questions, of noise and light.  The press seem to fill the
  entire street.

        WILLIAM
    Jesus Christ.

  He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him.  Anna is in
  the kitchen.

        ANNA
    What?

        WILLIAM
    Don't ask.

  She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.

        ANNA
    You're up to something...

  She thinks he's fooling around.  She opens the door, the same
  explosion.  In a split second she's inside.

        ANNA
    Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you
    dressed like that?

        WILLIAM
    Undressed like this, yes.

        ANNA
    Jesus.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

  Anna is on the phone.  Spike is blithely heading downstairs to
  the kitchen in just his underpants.

        SPIKE
    Morning, daring ones.

  He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows
  was a 'result.'

        ANNA
      (on the phone)
    It's Anna.  The press are here.  No,
    there are hundreds of them.  My
    brilliant plan was not so brilliant
    after all.  Yeh, I know, I know.  Just
    get me out then.
      (she hangs up)
    Damnit.

  She heads upstairs.

        WILLIAM
    I wouldn't go outside.

        SPIKE
    Why not?

        WILLIAM
    Just take my work for it.

  The moment William goes upstairs, Spike heads for the front
  door.

  EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY

  From outside -- we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the
  doorway, in his grey underpants.  A thousand photos.  Spike
  poses athletically.

  INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall-
  way, muttering.

        SPIKE
    How did I look?

  Inspects himself.

        SPIKE
    Not bad.  No bad at all.  Well-chosen
    briefs, I'd say.  Chicks love grey.
    Mmmmm.  Nice firm buttocks.

  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

  William enters.  He's unhappy for her.  She's almost dressed.

        WILLIAM
    How are you doing?

        ANNA
    How do you think I'm doing?

        WILLIAM
    I don't know what happened.

        ANNA
    I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd
    make a buck or two telling the papers
    where I was.

  She's packing.

        WILLIAM
    That's not true.

        ANNA
    Really?  The entire British press just
    woke up this morning and thought 'Hey --
    I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in
    that house with the blue door in Notting
    Hill.'  And then you go out in your
    goddamn underwear.

        SPIKE
      (dropping in)
    I went out in my goddamn underwear too.

        WILLIAM
    Get out, Spike.
      (he does)
    I'm so sorry.

        ANNA
    This is such a mess.  I come to you to
    protect myself against more crappy
    gossip and now I'm landed in it all
    over again.  For God's sake, I've got
    a boyfriend.

        WILLIAM
    You do?

  It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand.

        ANNA
    As far as they're concerned I do.  And
    now tomorrow there'll be pictures of
    you in every newspapers from here to
    Timbuktu.

        WILLIAM
    I know, I know -- but... just -- let's
    stay calm...

        ANNA
    You can stay calm -- it's the perfect
    situation for you -- minimum input,
    maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever
    bump into will know.  'Well done you --
    you slept with that actress -- we've
    seen the pictures.'

        WILLIAM
    That's spectacularly unfair.

        ANNA
    Who knows, it may even help business.
    Buy a boring book about Egypt from the
    guy who screwed Anna Scott.

  She heads out.

  INT. STAIRS/LIVING ROOM - DAY

        WILLIAM
    Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down.
    Have a cup of tea.

        ANNA
    I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I
    want to go home.

  The doorbell goes.

        WILLIAM
    Spike, check who that is... and for
    God's sake put some clothes on.

  Spike leans merrily out of the window.

        SPIKE
    Looks like a chauffeur to me.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY

  They move from the kitchen into the corridor.

        ANNA
    And remember -- Spike owes you an
    expensive dinner.  Or holiday --
    depending if he's got the brains to get
    the going rate on betrayal.

        WILLIAM
    That's not true.  And wait a minute...
    this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just
    laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the
    huge sweep of things, this stuff
    doesn't matter.

        SPIKE
    What he's going to say next is -- there
    are people starving in the Sudan.

        WILLIAM
    Well, there are.  And we don't need to
    go anywhere near that far.  My best
    friend slipped -- she slipped down-
    stairs, cracked her back and she's in a
    wheelchair for the rest of her life.
    All I'm asking for is a normal amount
    of perspective.

        ANNA
    You're right: of course, you're right.
    It's just that I've dealt with this
    garbage for ten years now -- you've had
    it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives
    are different.

        WILLIAM
    I mean -- today's newspapers will be
    lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.

        ANNA
    Excuse me?

        WILLIAM
    Well, you know -- it's just one day.
    Today's papers will all have been
    thrown away tomorrow.

        ANNA
    You really don't get it.  This story
    gets filed.  Every time anyone writes
    anything about me -- they'll dig up
    these photos.  Newspapers last forever.
    I'll regret this forever.

  He takes this in.  That's the end.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Fine.  I will do the opposite,
    if it's all right by you -- and always be
    glad you came.  But you're right -- you
    probably better go.

  She looks at him.  The doorbell goes again.  She opens the door.
  Massive noise and photos.  Outside are her people, including
  Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  And then the door is shut
  and they're all gone.  Silence.

  INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY

  Spike and William sitting there.  Pause.

        WILLIAM
    Was it you?

        SPIKE
    I suppose I might have told one or two
    people down the pub.

        WILLIAM
    Right.

  He puts his head in his hands.  It's over now.

  EXT. LONDON - DAY

  As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through
  Notting Hill.

  This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually
  and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,
  back into spring...

  First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
  pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.

  As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
  collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats --
  chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
  of snow.

  Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
  for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.

  By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
  in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --
  arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns
  past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
  The camera holds on her.

  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

  A grey day in the bookshop.  Martin and William.  As ever.  A
  feeling that things in there ever change.

  Ten seconds pass.  Honey rushes in.  Spike, still feeling in
  disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.

        HONEY
    Have we got something for you.
    Something which will make you love me so
    much you'll want to hug me every single
    day for the rest of my life.

        WILLIAM
    Blimey.  What's that?

        HONEY
    The phone number of Anna Scott's agent
    in London and her agent in New York.
    You can ring her.  You think about her
    all the time -- now you can ring her!

        WILLIAM
    Well, thanks, that's great.

        HONEY
    It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight.
    Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.

  And she rushes out.  William looks at the piece of paper, folds
  it and then places it gently in the garbage bin.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.  All the friends are
  gathered in the restaurant.

        BELLA
    I have a little speech to make -- I won't
    stand up because I can't... be bothered.
    Exactly a year ago today, this man here
    started the finest restaurant in London.

        TONY
    Thank you very much.

        BELLA
    Unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat
    here.

        TONY
    A tiny hiccough.

        BELLA
    And so we must face the fact that from
    next week, we have to find somewhere
    near to eat.

  Tony's brave face breaks.  The dream is over.

        BELLA
    I just want to say to Tony -- don't take
    it personally.  The more I think about
    things, the more I see no rhyme or reason
    in life -- no one knows why some things
    work out, and some things don't -- why
    some of us get lucky -- and some of us...

        BERNIE
    ... get fired.

        BELLA
    No!

        BERNIE
    Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit
    much more towards the trading side --
    and of course...
      (he owns up)
    I was total crap.

  They're all rather stunned.

        TONY
    So we go down together!  A toast to
    Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the
    whole world!

  They toast him.

        HONEY
    Since it's an evening of announcements
    ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've
    decided to get engaged.

  Total bewilderment from the others.

        HONEY
    I've found myself a nice, slightly odd
    looking bloke who I know is going to
    make me happy for the rest of my life.

  Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings
  for Honey.

        WILLIAM
    Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I
    don't know anything about this.

        MAX
    Is it someone we know?

        HONEY
    Yes.  I will keep you informed.

  As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers.

        HONEY
    By the way -- it's you.

        SPIKE
    Me?

        HONEY
    Yes.  What do you think?

        SPIKE
    Well, yes.  Groovy.

        MAX
    Any more announcements?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- I feel I must apologize to
    everyone for my behavior for the last
    six months.  I have, as you know, been
    slightly down in the mouth.

        MAX
    There's an understatement.  There are
    dead people on better form.

        WILLIAM
    But I wish to make it clear I've turned
    a corner and henceforward intend to be
    impressively happy.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  Two hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a
  chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon'
  on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.

  At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.

        BELLA
    I'm really horribly drunk.

  Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.

        MAX
    So -- you've laid the ghost.

        WILLIAM
    I believe I have.

        MAX
    Don't give a damn about the famous girl.

        WILLIAM
    No, don't think I do.

        MAX
    Which means you won't be distracted by
    the fact that she's back in London,
    grasping her Oscar, and to be found
    filming most days on Hampstead Heath.

  He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of
  Anna on its cover.

        WILLIAM
      (immediate gloom)
    Oh God no.

        MAX
    So not over her, in fact.

  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

  Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely
  alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and
  sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the
  radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.

  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY

  Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where
  he is himself approached.

        SECURITY
    Can I help you?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...

        SECURITY
    Does she know you're coming?

        WILLIAM
    No, no.  She doesn't.

        SECURITY
    I'm afraid I can't really let you
    through then, sir.

        WILLIAM
    Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm
    not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...

        SECURITY
    ... can't let you through.

  At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door
  open.  Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a
  velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
  She has a necessary cluster of people about her.  Hair, make-up,
  costume and the third assistant who has collected her.

  She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  And
  sees him.  Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
  simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing.
  Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole
  paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The
  movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and
  followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When
  she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her
  people hold back.  She doesn't really know what to say...

        ANNA
    This is certainly... ah...

        WILLIAM
    I only found out you were here
    yesterday.

        ANNA
    I was going to ring... but... I didn't
    think you'd want to...

  The third assistant is under pressure.

        THIRD
    Anna.

  She looks around.  The poor third is nervous -- and the first is
  approaching.

        ANNA
      (to William)
    It's not going very well -- and it's
    our last day.

        WILLIAM
    Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.

        ANNA
    But... wait... there are things to say.

        WILLIAM
    Okay.

        ANNA
    Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.

  She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.

        KAREN
    Come and have a look...

  EXT. KENWOOD PARK - DAY

  As they make towards the set...

        KAREN
    Are you a fan of Henry James?

        WILLIAM
    This is Henry James film?

  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY

  A complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --
  and a huge moving crane.  They end up next to the sound desk.

        KAREN
    This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of
    headphones so you can hear the dialogue.

  Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding
  fellow.  He hands him the headphones.

        HARRY
    Here we go.  The volume control is on
    the side.

        WILLIAM
    That's great.

  William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is
  a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping
  wide-shot.  He watches Anna.  She is with her co-star in the
  Henry James film -- let's call him James.

        JAMES
    We are living in cloudcuckooland --
    we'll never get this done today.

        ANNA
    We have to.  I've got to be in New York
    on Thursday.

        JAMES
    Oh, stop showing off.

  He studies an actress a few yards to the left.

        JAMES
    God, that's an enormous arse.

        ANNA
    I'm not listening.

        JAMES
    No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so
    many tragic young teenagers with
    anorexia -- and that girl has an arse
    she could perfectly well share round
    with at least ten other women -- and
    still be beg-bottomed.

        ANNA
    I said I'm not listening -- and I think,
    looking at something that firm, you and
    your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'
    would be well-advised to keep quiet.

  Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his
  girl.  Anna prepares.

        ANNA
    So I ask you when you're going to tell
    everyone, and you say...?

        JAMES
    'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'

        ANNA
    And then I... right.

        JAMES
    Who was that rather difficult chap you
    were talking to on the way up?

        ANNA
    Oh... no one... no one.  Just some...
    guy from the past.  I don't know what
    he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward
    situation.

  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

  Cut back to William -- he has heard.

        WILLIAM
    Of course.

  He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.

        WILLIAM
    Thank you.

        HARRY
    Anytime.

  William walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't
  have had a clear reminder.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

  William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box.

        SPIKE
    What's going on?

        WILLIAM
    I'm going to throw out these old videos.

        SPIKE
    No.  You can't bin these.  They're
    classics.  I'm not allowing this.

        WILLIAM
    Right -- let's talk about rent...

        SPIKE
    Let me help.  We don't want all this
    shit cluttering up our lives.

  INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

  The next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a
  dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in.

        MARTIN
    I have to disturb you when you're
    cooking the books, but there's a
    delivery.

        WILLIAM
    Martin, can't you just deal with this
    yourself?

        MARTIN
    But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.

        WILLIAM
    Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet
    rag as much as I pay you?

  They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing
  his hands -- he's in a very good mood.

  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

  William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue
  skirt and top.

        ANNA
    Hi.

        WILLIAM
    Hello.

        ANNA
    You disappeared.

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I
    didn't want to disturb you.

        ANNA
    Well... how have you been?

        WILLIAM
    Fine.  Everything much the same.  When
    they change the law Spike and I will
    marry immediately.  Whereas you...
    I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory
    ...

        ANNA
    Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me.
    I had no idea how much nonsense it all
    was -- but nonsense it all is...
      (she's nervous)
    Well, yesterday was our last day
    filming and so I'm just off -- but I
    brought you this from home, and...

  It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot,
  leaning against a bookshelf.

        ANNA
    I thought I'd give it to you.

        WILLIAM
    Thank you.  Shall I...

        ANNA
    No, don't open it yet -- I'll be
    embarrassed.

        WILLIAM
    Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know
    what it's for.  But thank you anyway.

        ANNA
    I actually had it in my apartment in New
    York and just thought you'd... but,
    when it came to it, I didn't know how to
    call you... having behaved so... badly,
    twice.  So it's been just sitting in the
    hotel.  But then... you came, so I
    figured... the thing is... the thing is
    ...

        WILLIAM
    What's the thing?

  Then the door pings.  In walks the annoying customer, Mr. Smith.

        WILLIAM
    Don't even think about it.  Go away
    immediately.

  Mr. Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.

        MR. SMITH
    Right.  Sorry.

  And he leaves.

        WILLIAM
    You were saying...

        ANNA
    Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away
    today but I wondered, if I didn't,
    whether you might let me see you a bit...
    or, a lot maybe... see if you could...
    like me again.

  Pause as William takes this in.

        WILLIAM
    But yesterday... that actor asked you
    who I was... and you just dismissed me
    out of hand... I heard -- you had a
    microphone... I had headphones.

        ANNA
    You expect me to tell the truth about my
    life to the most indiscreet man in
    England?

  Martin edges up.

        MARTIN
    Excuse me -- it's your mother on the
    phone.

        WILLIAM
    Can you tell her I'll ring her back.

        MARTIN
    I actually tried that tack -- but she
    said you said that before and it's been
    twenty-four hours, and her foot that
    was purple is now a sort of blackish
    color...

        WILLIAM
    Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold
    the fort for a second will you, Martin?

  Martin is left with Anna.

        MARTIN
    Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a
    wonderful film.

        ANNA
    Is that right?

        MARTIN
    Yes... I've always wondered what
    Patrick Swayze is like in real life.

        ANNA
    I can't say I know Patrick all that
    well.

        MARTIN
    Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the
    filming?

        ANNA
    Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly --
    to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in
    'Ghost.'

  She's kind in here, not sarcastic.

        MARTIN
    Oh right.  Right.  Sorry.  Always been
    a bit of an ass.

  William returns a little uneasy.

        MARTIN
    Anyway... it's lovely to meet you.  I'm
    a great fan of yours.  And Demi's, of
    course.

  Martin leaves them.

        WILLIAM
    Sorry about that.

        ANNA
    That's fine.  There's always a pause
    when the jury goes out to consider its
    verdict.

  She's awaiting an answer.

        WILLIAM
    Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level-
    headed bloke.  Not often in and out of
    love.  But...

  He can't really express what he feels.

        WILLIAM
    ... can I just say 'no' to your kind
    request and leave it at that?

        ANNA
    ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I...
    you know... of course... I'll just...
    be getting along then... nice to see
    you.

        WILLIAM
    The truth is...

  He feels he must explain.

        WILLIAM
    ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It
    took like a perfect situation, apart
    from that foul temper of yours -- but my
    relatively inexperienced heart would,
    I fear, not recover if I was once again
    ... cast aside, which I would
    absolutely expect to be.  There are too
    many pictures of you everywhere, too
    many films.  You'd go and I'd be...
    well, buggered, basically.

        ANNA
    I see.
      (pause)
    That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?

        WILLIAM
    I live in Notting Hill.  You live in
    Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world
    knows who you are.  My mother has
    trouble remembering my name.

        ANNA
    Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.

  Pause.

        ANNA
    The fame thing isn't really real, you
    know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a
    girl.  Standing in front of a boy.
    Asking him to love her.

  Pause.  She kisses him on the cheek.

        ANNA
    Bye.

  Then turns and leaves.  Leaving him.

  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY

  The restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The
  pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension
  lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there.

        WILLIAM
    What do you think?  Good move?

        HONEY
    Good move: when all is said and done,
    she's nothing special.  I saw her
    taking her pants off and I definitely
    glimpsed some cellulite down there.

        BELLA
    Good decision.  All actresses are mad
    as snakes.

        WILLIAM
    Tony -- what do you think?

        TONY
    Never met her, never want to.

        WILLIAM
    Brilliant.  Max?

        MAX
    Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.

        WILLIAM
    Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.

  Spike enters.

        SPIKE
    I was called and I came.  What's up?

        HONEY
    William has just turned down Anna Scott.

        SPIKE
    You daft prick!

  Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside
  William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which
  was on his wall.

        BELLA
    This painting isn't the original, is
    it?

        WILLIAM
    Yes, I think that one may be.

        BERNIE
    But she said she wanted to go out with
    you?

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- sort of...

        BERNIE
    That's nice.

        WILLIAM
    What?

        BERNIE
    Well, you know, anybody saying they
    want to go out with you is... pretty
    great... isn't it...

        WILLIAM
    It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean,
    I know she's an actress and all that, so
    she can deliver a line -- but she said
    that she might be as famous as can be --
    but also... that she was just a girl,
    standing in front of a boy, asking him
    to love her.

  They take in the line.  It totally reverses their attitudes.
  A pause.

        WILLIAM
    Oh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong
    decision, haven't I?

  They look at him.  Spike does a big nod.

        WILLIAM
    Max, how fast is your car?

  EXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY

  Max's car arrives in the street outside.  They pile into the
  car.

        MAX
    If anyone gets in our way -- we have
    small nuclear devices.

        BERNIE
    And we intend to use them!

        MAX
    Where's Bella?

        HONEY
    She's not coming.

        MAX
    Sod that.  Bernie -- in the back!

  He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of
  the chair.

        MAX
    Come on, babe.

  EXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAY

  Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.  We are inside and
  outside the car.

        BELLA
    Where are you going?

        MAX
    Down Kensington Church Street, then
    Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

        BELLA
    Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...

        HONEY
    That's right -- then Park Lane.

        BERNIE
    Or you could go right down to Cromwell
    Road, and left.

        WILLIAM
    No!

  Suddenly the car slams to a halt.

        MAX
    Stop right there!  I will decide the
    route.  All right?

        ALL
    All right.

        MAX
    James Bond never has to put up with this
    sort of shit.

  EXT. PICCADILLY - DAY

  The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way
  down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.  William
  sprints into the hotel.  Bernie follows.

        BERNIE
    Bloody hell, this is fun.

  IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY

        WILLIAM
    Is Miss Scott staying here?

  It is the same man.

        RITZ MAN
    No, sir.

        WILLIAM
    How about Miss Flintstone?

        RITZ MAN
          No, sir.

        WILLIAM
    Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or
    Butthead?

  Man shakes his head.

        RITZ MAN
    No, sir.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.

  He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops
  him in his tracks.

        RITZ MAN
    There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126
    -- but she checked out an hour ago.  I
    believe she's holding a press
    conference at The Savoy before flying to
    America.

  William is very grateful.  He kisses the Ritz Man.  Bernie's also
  gratuful.  He kisses him too.

        BERNIE
    We have lift off!!

  A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz
  Man gets kissed a third time.

  EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

  The car speeds through London.  It gets totally stuck at a
  junction where no one will let them in.

        SPIKE
    Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

  He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the
  opposite direction.  Our car shoots past him.

        SPIKE
    Go!

  They leave him behind.  Honey leans out the window and shouts...

        HONEY
    You're my hero.

  Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly
  hit by a car.

  EXT. THE SAVOY - DAY

  They pull to a stop.  William leaps out.

        MAX
    Go!

  INT. THE SAVOY - DAY

  William rushes up to the main desk.

        WILLIAM
    Excuse me, where's the press
    conference?

        MAN AT SAVOY
    Are you an accredited member of the
    press?

        WILLIAM
    Yes...

  He flashes a card.

        MAN AT SAVOY
    That's a Blockbuster video membership
    card, sir.

        WILLIAM
    That's right... I work for their in-
    house magazine.
      (mimes quotation marks)
    'Movies are our business.'

        MAN AT SAVOY
    I'm sorry, sir...

  Honey shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair.

        BELLA
    He's with me.

        MAN AT SAVOY
    And you are?

        BELLA
    Writing an article about how London
    hotels treat people in wheelchairs.

        MAN AT SAVOY
    Of course, madam.  It's in the
    Lancaster Room.  I'm afraid you're very
    late.

        HONEY
      (to William)
    Run!

  INT. SAVOR ROOM - DAY

  William runs, searching.  At last finds the room, and enters.

  INT. LANCASTER ROOM - DAY

  Huge room -- full of press.  Row after row of journalists,
  cameras at the front, TV cameras at the back.  Anna clearly
  gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is
  positively presidential.  She sits at a table at the end of the
  room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the PR boss,
  firmly marshalling the questions.

        JEREMY
    Yes... You -- Dominic.

        QUESTIONER 1
    How much longer are you staying in the
    UK then?

        ANNA
    No time at all.  I fly out tonight.

  She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.

        JEREMY
    Which is why we have to round it up now.
    Final questions.

  He points at a journalist he knows.

        QUESTIONER  2
    Is your decision to take a year off
    anything to do with the rumours about
    Jeff and his present leading lady?

        ANNA
    Absolutely not.

        QUESTIONER 2
    Do you believe the rumours?

        ANNA
    It's really not my business any more.
    Though I will say, from my experience,
    that rumours about Jeff... do tend to
    be true.

  They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.
  Next question comes from someone straight right next to
  William.

        QUESTIONER 3
    Last time you were here, there were some
    fairly graphic photographs of you and a
    young English guy -- so what happened
    there?

        ANNA
    He was just a friend -- I think we're
    still friends.

        JEREMY
    Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.

  He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.

        WILLIAM
    Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any
    circumstances in which you two might be
    more than just friends?

  Anna sees who it is asking.

        ANNA
    I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm
    assured there aren't.

        WILLIAM
    And what would you say...

        JEREMY
    No, it's just one question per person.

        ANNA
    No, let him... ask away.  You were
    saying?

        WILLIAM
    Yes, I just wondered whether if it
    turned out that this... person...

        OTHER JOURNALIST
      (to William)
    His name is Thacker.

        WILLIAM
    Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker
    realized he'd been a daft prick and got
    down on his knees and begged you to
    reconsider, whether you would...
    reconsider.

  We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching.  Then back
  to Anna.

        ANNA
    Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.

        WILLIAM
    That's very good news.  The readers of
    'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely
    delighted.

  Anna whispers something to Jeremy.

        JEREMY
    Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your
    question again?

        QUESTIONER 1
    Yes -- Anna -- how long are you
    intending to stay here in Britain?

  Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.

        ANNA
    Indefinitely.

  They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
  of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.
  Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.

        SPIKE
    What happened?

        HONEY
    It was good.

  Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike.

  Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at
  Anna.  They are both smiling.

  INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY

  Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
  crowd.

  Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
  least four other bridesmaids, all under five.

  Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
  pyramidical wedding cake.

  William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She
  tries to brush his hair.

  Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
  dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little
  move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.

  Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
  song, entirely happy in the corner.

  EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

  A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out
  of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous
  -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.

  EXT. GARDEN - DAY

  A pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched
  by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very
  old couple wander along slowly.

  A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera
  glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
  bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just
  looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It
  is William and Anna.

        THE END

    EXT. FIELD - DAY
1                                                                  1
     We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of
    children's laughter. Excited shrieking.

     A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs
    through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE,
    and sister, ANNE, (10).

     Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head
    skimming along the sheaves.

     REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their
    parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).

                            SIR THOMAS
              I received a formal request for marriage
             today for Anne.
                     (a beat)
              From the Carey family.

    SIR THOMAS indicates to
                         ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.
    Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.

                        LADY ELIZABETH
           But that's wonderful.

                        SIR THOMAS
             I turned it down.

     LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'

                        SIR THOMAS
            And offered them Mary instead.

    SIR THOMAS indicates 
                         MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
    Pretty. Sweet-natured.

                          SIR THOMAS
           Fnne's too good for William Carey. She
           can do (better than a merchant's son.

                          LADY ELIZABETH
            You underestimate Mary.

                          SIR THOMAS
            Not true. I think she's..the kinder of
           the two. Quite possibly the fairer.

    The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..

                         SIR THOMAS
           But to get ahead in this world, you need
           more than fair looks and a kind heart.

     On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms
    aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.

                                                                2.


    SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..

                        SIR THOMAS
                  (applauding his favourite)
           Bravo! Anne!

    Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church.

    MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her
    room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final
    adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door.

                        ANNE
           May we come in..?

    ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..

                        ANNE
           Look at you..! Younger than me. More
           beautiful than me. Married before me.
                  (a beat)
           I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other
           Boleyn Girl.'

                        MARY
           Hardly.

                        GEORGE
           No, is this it? This is the end of the
           unholy trinity?

    GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An
    intimate moment.

                        MARY
           No, George. Never. I'll be married,
           that's all..
                  (a beat)
           Apart from that - it won't change a
           thing.

    The three of them hug together, tightly..

    A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air
    is thick with incense. And winter cold..




                                                             3.


    The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled on one side. FATHER,
    MOTHER, the DUKE and DUCHESS of NORFOLK, brother GEORGE, and
    finally ANNE..

                        PRIEST
           Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in
           nobis..

    The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY,
    (35), puts it on MARY's finger.

      few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her
    across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.


    INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT

    The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom,
    (WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and
    other GUESTS..

                        WILLIAM
           Are you happy?

                         MARY
           Very.

                        WILLIAM
           You don't secretly wish you'd married
           someone grander? With a title?

                        MARY
           No. I want a husband who loves me. And
           who thinks it first thing every morning.
           And last thing at night.

                        WILLIAM
           Then you've found the right man.

    IN ANOTHER CORNER:

    ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the
    NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church..

                        ANNE
           Who is that? He was staring at me in
           church?

                        GEORGE
           That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of
           Northumberland. Richest landowner in
           England.

    ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"




                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        GEORGE
           But don't get your hopes up. He is
           already betrothed.

    GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..

                        ANNE
           Betrothed is not married, brother
           George. A lot can happen before you
           reach the altar.

    ANNE stares over at HENRY PERCY. Who stares back.


    IN ANOTHER CORNER:

     he DUKE OF NORFOLK, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and
    close personal friend of the KING's walks with his growling DOGS
    to where SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and LADY ELIZABETH are sitting. SIR
    THOMAS gets to his feet..

                         SIR THOMAS
           Thomas..

     he DUKE ignores THOMAS, and goes instead to his sister, (LADY
    ELIZABETH), and kisses her..

                         NORFOLK
           I think I have managed to persuade the
           King to come and stay with you on
           progress. A week-end's hunting in late
           summer.

                        SIR THOMAS
           But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank
           you so much..
                  (he turns to ELIZABETH)
           Did you hear that, Elizabeth?

                        LADY ELIZABETH
                  (hates the idea)
           Yes.

                        SIR THOMAS
           Finally we can present George, and with
           luck, get him a position at court.

    LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..

                        NORFOLK
           These are difficult times. I have it on
           good authority that the Queen no longer
           bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir
           is still not resolved.

           It cannot be long before the King is
           forced to look outside the marriage.

                                                             5.


                        SIR THOMAS
           What? And make a bastard King of
           England?

                        NORFOLK
           A legitimized bastard. What choice does
           he have?
                  (a beat)
           Obviously, I've given it thought, and
           wondered which Howard girl I could put
           under his nose. Imagine the influence
           that would give us. To be blood family
           of the next King of England. Equally,
           imagine if another family were to
           achieve the same?

    NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two
    loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..

                        SIR THOMAS
           What about Anne?

    SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's
    dancing with GEORGE...

                        SIR THOMAS
           I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not
           officially a `Howard', but as your
           sister's daughter..

                        NORFOLK
           But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your
           first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't
           you prefer her to have a nice,
           uncomplicated, respectable marriage?
           Like Mary?

                        SIR THOMAS
           If Anne were an uncomplicated,
           respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say
           `yes'. But she's not.

    SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..

                        SIR THOMAS
           She's anything but.

    SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the
    party continue. ELIZABETH's face darkens..

                         ADY ELIZABETH
             don't like it. It would cost a fortune
           to make our house fit for a royal visit.

                        LA king doesn't like her?
           Or if she sleeps with him but gives him
           a girl?

                        SIR THOMAS
           And what if you were to look on the
           bright side? Just once?

    An ominous clap of thunder outside..

                        SIR THOMAS
           Risk nothing, you gain nothing.

     ADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband..

                        LADY ELIZABETH
            hen was it that people stopped thinking
           of ambition as a sin, and started
           thinking of it as a virtue?

                        SIR THOMAS
           Easy for you to say. You've had power
           and wealth all your life.

                        LADY ELIZABETH
           Until I married you, Thomas. And I was
           happy to give it up.

    LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside.

    ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits.
    Presently, the door opens. We see SIR THOMAS inside..

                        ANNE
           You asked to see me father?

    MARY is in a bathroom. Being prepared by ANNE for her wedding
    night. ANNE brushes her sister's hair. Rubs oil in her skin.

                        MARY
            o - the King himself is coming to
           Hever. I'm so happy for George.

                        ANNE
           Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems
           he has ambitions for me, too.

            He thinks I'm ANNE(coage dnow...and of not
                          of an nt' )
            unpleasing appearance...

                         MARY
            What? What are you saying..?

                         ANNE
            It's known the King has a wandering eye.
            Imagine...if he were to like me?

                          MARY
            But...you could never be more than his
            mistress. And that's no substitute for a
            husband.
                         ANNE
            But as the King's mistress the least I'd
            get after he finished with me would be
            an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And
            gave him what his wife has failed to?
                    a beat)
            Quite apart from the money, it'd be a

                         MARY
            But what about your happiness? Your
            future?

     ANNE shrugs, smiles..

     MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares
     at the bed. A child. Suddenly terrified.

                         ANNE
            Are you nervous?

                         MARY
            A little.

                         ANNE
            You'll tell me everything in the
            morning?

                         MARY
            I promise.

                         ANNE
            No details spared?

     The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional.






The door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE
curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes.

MARY stares at her husband.

                    MARY
       Hold me a moment?

WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms..

                    MARY (cont'd)
       I'm so lucky to have a man who is
       content with what he has.

MARY looks at him..

                    MARY (cont'd)
       You are, aren't you?

WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..

                    WILLIAM
       I am the luckiest man in the world.

WILLIAM reaches for the wine..

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Drink?

MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists..

                    WILLIAM (cont'd)
       You should. It will hurt less.

MARY nervously drinks..

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Lie back.

MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls
down his trousers.

MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly
lowers himself on top of her. He enters her.

MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one
might not have imagined.

But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his
face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.

MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it?

                      WILLIAM (cont'd)
       Thank you.

     WILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores
     contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused.

      aybe this is how it's meant to be.

     The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust.

     The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER
     in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.

     The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS,
     who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS..

     It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not,
     This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end.

     Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome,
     in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest
     COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough,
     intimidating lot.

     Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large
     ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..

     Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the
     PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS.

     Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's
     weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,
     etc.

     Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING
     HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an
     assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting.

     And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS,
     and a second STANDARD BEARER..

     The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a
     hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance..

     Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder
     approaching. His expression changes...

     Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as
     STAFFORD calls out, "The King!"

         



                                                                10.

     ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside,
     she rushes over to the window to see the approaching RIDERS.

     ANNE looks out of the window. Scans the approaching RIDERS until
     she finds the KING..

                           ANNE
            There he is!

     The young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely
     glamorous and handsome figure. A total contrast from the
     bloated, bearded figure of his later years.

                         ANNE
            You think he will like me?

                         MARY
            Of course, sister. How could he not?

     ANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly.

     The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the
     house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge
     marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart
     uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens).

     MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of
     place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside
     her. The proud PARENTS.

     Everyone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives.

                         SIR THOMAS
            Your Majesty, you are most welcome.

     The King dismounts athletically. His DOGS are unleashed, bark
     excitedly..

                         HENRY

            Lady Elizabeth..

     A SERVANT in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings
     wine on a tray. HENRY takes a glass..

                         SIR THOMAS
            May I present my son, George.

     GEORGE, visibly nervous, bows deeply from the neck. But HENRY's
     attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind GEORGE..

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                         HENRY
                   (while staring at MARY)
            Your Uncle tells me I should have you at
            court. Should I?

                         GEORGE
            It would be a great honour, Sir.

     MARY dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..

                         SIR THOMAS
            And our daughter, Anne.

      ENRY turns to see ANNE.

                          ENRY
            No one said anything of a daughter.

     ANNE curtseys deeply...

                         HENRY
            Had we known, we might have come sooner.

                         ANNE
            Your Majesty..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you
            around our modest house?

                            HENRY
            A pleasure.

     ANNE offers HENRY her hand. He takes it, then leads ANNE away.
     MARY shoots ANNE a look, `Good luck'.

     ANNE leads the KING through the house. She is followed at a
     distance by SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. And watched by MARY and GEORGE
     from a gallery above..

                         ANNE
            Here is the library.

     HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..

                falcon, your Grace.

                         HENRY
            I can see that. But what's it doing
            there? More to the point..
                   (turns 360)
            ..not just there, but in every corner in
            the house?

                         ANNE

            Perhaps because falcons are vaguely
            associative with field sports - field
            sports with aristocracy - and in the
            absence of a genuine coat of arms..
                   (shrugs)
            ...a man with ambition will do the
            strangest things.

     HENRY is delighted by ANNE's candour..

                          ENRY
            That's a sharp tongue you have.

            Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from
            me. Unless he fears an excess of
            compliments.

     HENRY smiles, visibly charmed..

                         HENRY
            Really? And what would they be..?

     WATCHING FROM ABOVE, MARY smiles to herself, "Well done, Anne",
     as HENRY and ANNE continue down a corridor..

            Told me so himself. And has requested

            My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I
            knew you would up to the task.

     MARY watches. A momentary stab of jealousy at FATHER's
     attention. But as ANNE looks over at MARY for support..

     MARY smiles. Shakes herself out of it. It's her sister. What was
     she thinking?

     MUSIC is being played. Everyone is dressed in their finest, a
     packed banquet hall. MUSICIANS come to a climax, loud and
     enthusiastic applause from everyone. HENRY gets to his feet..

       Years behind their Italian counterparts.
       The truth is far from leading the world,
       we're a provincial outpost, lagging far
       behind.

       Or our navy? The finest in the world.

                    HENRY
       It's true.

                    ANNE
       The universities in Spain and the
       philosophers in Germany may be strong,
       but are they really the equal of Oxford
       and Thomas More?

                    HENRY
       Never!

                    ANNE
       I doubt there is a country that is
       fairer in Government, or better
       protected by nature from her enemies,
       whose people are happier or more
       prosperous..

ANNE. Who's hand, we notice, is shaking.

            enough to be invited to court, I am sure

     EXT. HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY

     The following morning..

     Thirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To
     one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired
     Lurchers), barking frantically.

      t's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation.

     The MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the
     biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful,
     ornate saddlery.

       number of OTHER LADIES are also going hunting, and we notice
     they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN,
     sitting behind them, holding onto them..
     F
      inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns..

                         ANNE
            Good morning, your Grace.

                         HENRY
             ho will you be riding with?

     It's clearly an invitation. He indicates there is room for ANNE
     on the back of his saddle. But ANNE fails to read the signal.

                         ANNE
            On my own your Grace.

                          HENRY
            Your own..?

     A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse.

                         ANNE
            They have invented a new saddle which
            allows ladies to ride on their own.

     ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..

                         HENRY
             ut with no man to hold onto? How will
            you stay on the horse?

                         ANNE
            Why? The same way you hold onto yours,
            your Grace.

     A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE
     has made.

                          HENRY
            We'll see.

      ENRY yanks the reins on his horse..

     ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows.

     The thunder of hooves..

     WILLIAM STAFFORD leads the way out with a pack of some forty or
     fifty hounds. It's a stirring sight. Following the hounds, come
     thirty or forty RIDERS, led by the KING himself.

     Up ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases.
     They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn..

     The DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their

     Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head..

     The sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching
     footsteps, like thunder.

     The STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest.

     The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost
     delirious with primal agitation..

     Among the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened
     up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts..

      n the advanced group, are HENRY, several COURTIERS, his GUARDS
     and, of course, ANNE..

     They jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the
     hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see..

     ANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades.
     He urges his horse to greater speed..

     The terrified DEER bolts into safety of the forest. The barking
     HOUNDS, locked into the scent, follow.

      he RIDERS see this, and some pull up.

                          IDER
            We've lost him. He's in the forest.

     Galloping through trees and thick forest is not for the
     fainthearted. But HENRY charges past, kicking up dirt..

                         HENRY
            Then we must follow.

     HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks
     over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind..

     Sharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind
     him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches,
     and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly
     impervious to the whipping branches..

                           ANNE
            Hah!

     Ahead, the DEER darts and weaves. The HOUNDS give chase.


     EXT. FOREST - RAVINE - DAY

      alf a mile ahead..

     A steep ravine, with a sheer drop of twenty-five feet deep. At
     the bottom, a brook with dangerous rocks, then another sheer
     climb of twenty-five feet the other side.

     The DEER arrives, looks, then scampers down the ravine, pursued
     by the HOUNDS.

      he remaining RIDERS arrive. They see the DEER scramble up the
     other side, followed by the DOGS, slipping in the mud, and
     struggling with the brook.

      everal DOGS fall. Yelping in fright and pain as they lose
     footing and fall on the rocks. The KING pulls up his horse..

     HENRY raises his hat, and salutes the DEER.

                          ENRY
             he King of England defeated by a humble
            fawn.

     The COURTIERS laugh, then they turn their horses around and head
     off. ANNE stares. It's a clear opportunity to impress. She looks
     down at the rocks. A long stare, then..

                         ANNE
                   (suddenly kicking horse)
            Hah!

     The COURTIERS gasp in disbelief as ANNE lurches forward, and
     leaps into space, heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine.

      orse and rider almost tumble down the vertiginous, lethal drop.
     But, reaching the bottom, the horse leaps across the brook, then
     scrambles up the other side.

     She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING
     stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her.

         long silence. Nothing but the sound of wind in the trees..

                           COURTIER
              Please, your Majesty. It's not safe.

     HENRY turns and stares daggers at the COURTIER, `Silence'. He
     stares across the ravine at ANNE. Their eyes meet.

      hen he kicks his horse, `Hah!', and lurches forward. He heads
     down the sheer ravine. The COURTIERS gasp, rush to the edge of
     the ravine to watch. ANNE goes to the edge her side.

      ENRY's horse slides perilously down the ravine, then struggles
     to clear the brook, and lands heavily in the water.

       he KING struggles to keep control, and as the horse tries to
     scramble up the bank the other side, it loses it's footing in
     T
     the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air..

      he COURTIERS cry out in horror, ANNE covers her mouth as..

     The KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him
     flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and
     tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks..

     Pandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of
     horror, raising the alarm.

     ANNE's FACE: what has she done?

     HENRY slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of
     faces. A PHYSICIAN, SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, the DUKE of NORFOLK, one
     or two COURTIERS, and finally, ANNE..

                           PHYSICIAN
              It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no
              broken bones..

     HENRY flinches in agony, tries to move..

                           SIR THOMAS
              My daughter Anne is here. Would like to
              apologise.

                            ENRY
                     (recoils, his pride hurt)
              No! Get her away from me!

     ANNE opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered
     out of the room.

LATER: HENRY's wound is being dressed by MARY.

                    HENRY
       And who are you?

                    MARY
       Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister.

HENRY looks her up and down..

                    HENRY
       You've been here all week-end?

                    MARY
       Yes, your Grace.

                    HENRY
       Really? How could I have overlooked you?

                    MARY
       Next to Anne, it's easy to do.

                    HENRY
       Nonsense.

HENRY sits up, takes H better look. Intrigued.

                     ENRY (cont'd)

       Yes, your Grace. To William Carey.

                     ENRY
       From Wolsey's office?

                    MARY
       Yes, your Grace.

                    HENRY
       Then why haven't I seen you at court?

                    MARY
       Because I have persuaded him to spend a
       year or two here first. We have a small
       manor and some land. Nothing much. But
       enough to start a family.

                    HENRY
       A charmed life in the country? Away from
       it all?

                    MARY
       Yes.

            And duty called.

     HENRY looks at MARY, then..

                         HENRY

            A young, ambitious man?

                         MARY

     MARY lowers her eyes..

                         MARY
            But, if he ever changed his mind, I
            would always support him.

     HENRY stares at MARY.

                         HENRY
            Well said.

     Strapped and bandaged, HENRY is helped onto his horse. Beside
     him GEORGE BOLEYN is also on a horse, riding off to court for
     the first time..

     SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH bow, curtsey farewell..

                         HENRY
            Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We'll
            take good care of your boy..
                   (kissing her hand)
            And Thomas..

     HENRY embraces him, whispers in SIR THOMAS's ear..

                         HENRY
            You'll take care of that matter?

                         SIR THOMAS
            Consider it done, your Majesty.

     HENRY shoots a lingering look at MARY, which ANNE notices. Then
     the King and his entourage ride off.

     MARY waves farewell to GEORGE. ANNE stares. Suspicious.

     and WILLIAM STAFFORD emerges..

                         STAFFORD
            Your Father wishes to see you.

     MARY and ANNE get to their feet. STAFFORD raises his hand..

                         STAFFORD
            Just Mary.

     MARY shoots ANNE a quizzical look, then goes with STAFFORD.

WILLIAM CAREY clears his throat. Avoids MARY's eyes..

                    WILLIAM
       The King has also offered me a position.
       As Gentleman of the Privy Council.

       what this means?

MARY stares imploringly..

       They will separate us. Put me in
       different accommodation. Where the King
       can always...find me.

     MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang',
     walks straight into ANNE. A tense moment. The two SISTERS stare
     at one another..

            No! You're welcome to him. I have my own
            plans, which don't involve becoming a
            rag that will one day be discarded.

     MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by
     SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall
     Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates.

     MARY's face: as the heavy gates open. She shoots a last look at
     the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace
     gates.

     `CLANK', the heavy doors shut behind her.

     The outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at
     palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'.

     MARY. Then he lets the curtain fall.

       Appointed by...his Majesty the King.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       By my husband? Really?

The air crackles with tension. It's school bullying.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       Well, then she must be some kind of
       gift. He must have seen in her some
       special talent that would please me.
       Tell me. What special talent is it that
       you have?
               with icy contempt)

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       Music! That's it! You compose? Or sing?

                    MARY
        ..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty.

The Spanish GUITARIST obliges by starting to play a well-known
tune of the period..

       No..really..I beg you, your Majesty.

                   (barks, suddenly terrifying)
            I command you to SING!!!

     MARY flinches. Blushing deeply, her skin glowing with
     perspiration and terror, she begins to sing..

     Normally she sings well. But her voice now is strangled with
     fear. MARY stands rigid, her knuckles whiten, nails digging into
     her hands, drawing blood.

     Finally, MARY finishes. The room is silent. All eyes on
     KATHERINE, who stares coldly. A formidable adversary.

                         QUEEN KATHERINE
            Bravo! A nightingale!
                   (the cruel satisfaction of

     MARY walks through the packed corridors of court, her face
     burning from the humiliation. The sound of a voice behind her..

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
             ait! Mary! Stop!

     But MARY does not hear. She continues walking, distressed, and
     distractedly enters..

     Finally, she is caught by JANE PARKER, whom we had seen at the
     window earlier. Younger, also English, a kindred spirit..

                         JANE
            I know that must have been agony, but
            put yourself in her shoes. She knows the
            only reason the King has asked you here
            is because he desires you. For a wife
            that must be very difficult.

            She's a good woman. Trust me.

     JANE smiles. MARY manages a smile..

                           MARY
            Yes.

                         JANE
            I've seen him a few times at court. And
            like him...very well.

            But I don't think he has noticed me.

            I can't imagine.
                   (a beat)
            Should I mention you to him?

                         MARY
            Of course. Happily.

      ANE PARKER smiles. But as soon as MARY's back is turned, the
     smile fades.

     A large dusty yard, where KNIGHTS train for combat, and practise
     their fighting skills. MARY is with GEORGE, who is putting on
     his armour..

                         GEORGE
            Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course
            I have. How could I not? She looks like
            a goat.

                         MARY
            Well, she likes you, and asked me to
            give you this..to remember her by.

     MARY hands over a handkerchief..

                         GEORGE
            Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or
            that you forgot.

     GEORGE hastily gives it back..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            There is something about that woman that
            makes me feel...

     GEORGE gets to his feet, indicates to his MALE COURTIER friend
     that he is coming..

            And our sister? Any word?

                         GEORGE
            ANNE? You know she took being upstaged
            by you very badly.

                           MARY
            Yes, I know.

                         GEORGE
            And no amount of interventions on my
            behalf would make her believe you hadn't
            done it intentionally.

                         MARY
            But you KNOW I would never do anything
            like that.

                           GEORGE
            I know.

     GEORGE finds his helmet, puts it on..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            Just give her time. She'll come round.

     MARY watches GEORGE go to join the other MALE COURTIERS.

     MARY enters her room, and closes the door. She begins
     undressing, taking off her clothes, then catches sight of a DOG
     in the shadows. She gasps. It's the KING's dog.

                         HENRY (O.S.)
            Please, don't be alarmed.

      ENRY steps out of the shadows..

     MARY covers herself in modesty, and falls to her knees in a deep
     curtsey of deference. HENRY steps into the light, walks towards
     her..                H
                          ENRY
            I wanted to find somewhere we could be
            alone so I might say a few words to you
            in person.

      ENRY turns, looks around the room..

                         HENRY
            I hope your accommodation is
            comfortable. I realise it's no

            What are you..?

     MARY's dress comes off her shoulder. The KING's eyes, however,
     instead of staring at MARY's beautiful, exposed body, stay
     focused on her eyes. An uncomfortable moment..

                         HENRY
            I am sorry.
                   (delicately putting her
                    clothes back on MARY)
            You obviously misunderstand me.

     MARY standing in the room..

     The DUKE of NORFOLK stares in disbelief at MARY. His dogs lie
     intimidatingly at his feet.

                         NORFOLK
            What? If all the King wanted was

            shoes.

                         MARY
            Your opinion, Uncle.

     MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head..

                         MARY
            Mine is that it's the greatest insult of
            all.

                          ORFOLK
            What?

     An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass,
     in Latin, for the Royal Household.

      he King sits at the front, on the left. With the men. The
     ladies are separated, as is traditional, and sit on the right.

     HENRY is lost in prayer. It's not long, however, before he turns
     to look at MARY.

     Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away.

       local PRIEST arrives. He sees two HORSES tethered to a tree by
     the side of the church. He dismounts. Checks no one has followed
     him.

      hen he enters the church.

     In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the
     Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood..

     But, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues
     to stare at MARY.

      inally, she looks up. Their eyes meet. MARY blushes, averts her
     gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks
     back.

     This is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of
     NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN.

     Everyone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them
     can concentrate..

     In the country church: The PRIEST's eyes become accustomed to
     the dark. Everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness..

                         PRIEST
            Are you there?

     Presently, a WOMAN steps into the light. It's ANNE. Dressed in a
     shawl.

            No one saw you?

     ANNE hands over a purse of coins. They walk to the altar..

                         PRIEST
            And the groom? Is he here?

     Up ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see
     his face. It's HENRY PERCY.

                          RIEST
            Good. Then let us begin.

     Back at court: the service ends.

     Everyone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But
     it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered..

     The extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge
     evidenced by..

     ..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL
     WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE
     and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected.

     MARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised
     at how good it feels. To be the number 1.

     MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a
     beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the
     KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it.

     Presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes
     widen in excitement. The King?

     She hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away
     in a drawer.

     She gets out of bed. Anxiously straightens her hair, then goes
     to the door, to find..

     GEORGE, her brother, who bursts in..

                         MARY
            George? It's the middle of the night.

                    MARY
       But they'll never allow it, don't you
       see? He's already precontracted to Mary
       Talbot, and if word of the consummation
       gets out her reputation will be ruined..

MARY pulls back her sheets..

                    MARY
       ...I have to tell Father. Before it's
       too late..

                      GEORGE
       What?

GEORGE watches MARY go to the door..

                    GEORGE
       Mary..! Wait! Come back!

     INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - BOLEYN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY
49                                                               49
     A FAMILY MEETING: ANNE and HENRY PERCY, (the HANDSOME YOUNG
     NOBLEMAN from Mary's wedding), stand in front of the DUKE of
     NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and GEORGE..

                         SIR THOMAS
            What were you thinking? The marriage of
            a senior noble is a matter of state.
            Something only the King can decide..

     HENRY PERCY looks down, avoiding eye contact..

                         NORFOLK
            Who knows about this?

                         ANNE
            No one.

                         NORFOLK
            Then that is how it shall remain.
            Forever.

                         ANNE
            But you cannot undo what has been done
            before God.
                   (defiant stare)
            And consummated too.

     `Snap', NORFOLK's quill breaks. SIR THOMAS almost chokes.
     GEORGE's eyes widen..

                         NORFOLK
            WHAT?

                         SIR THOMAS
                   (struggling to contain his
                    anger)
            There have been improper intimacies,
            too?

                         ANNE
            I have lain with my husband. There is
            nothing improper about it..

                         NORFOLK
            SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter
            I'd thrash you within an inch of your
            life..

     ANNE recoils, terrified..

                         SIR THOMAS
            The boy will return to Northumberland -
            where he will marry the Talbot girl. As
            arranged.

     SIR THOMAS gives the signal for WILLIAM STAFFORD to escort PERCY
     out.

                          ORFOLK
            As for you. You will go to France and
            stay there until you have learned your
            lesson.

                         MARY
            What?

                          ORFOLK
            How could you do this to your sister?
            You know full well her friendship with
            the King is at an extremely delicate
            stage. Any scandal or black mark against
            Mary's name now could be fatal.

     SIR THOMAS dismisses her..

                         NORFOLK
            You will join the court of the French
            Queen. And stay there until your father
            has forgiven you.

     ANNE goes. GEORGE follows..

     MARY paces anxiously in the corridor. Presently, ANNE emerges
     from the room. Burning with humiliation. Their eyes meet. MARY
     is about to speak, but ANNE cuts her off..

                         ANNE

                         MARY
            Because you would never have got away
            with it. And it would have ruined your
            prospects forever.
                   (a beat)
            Believe me. I did it for your good.

                         ANNE
            Really? For MY good? I'll try to remind
            myself of that. While I'm in exile. And
            you're here, in the King's bed, and
            unchallenged for our father's affection.
                    a beat)
            That it was for MY good. Not yours.

     ANNE storms out. GEORGE shoots MARY a look, "I'll deal with
     this", and runs after ANNE..

     OVER THIS: we fade in MUSIC and the sound of laughter..


     INT. BALL-ROOM - PALACE - NIGHT
 1                                                               51
     A grand MASQUE BALL. We're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom.
     MUSICIANS play. Large formations of DANCERS perform elaborately
     choreographed moves. Among them we pick out..

     SIR THOMAS BOLEYN stalking the party. Ever watchful. On duty.
     Vigilant. He is distracted by the sight of...

     His son, GEORGE BOLEYN, surrounded by FRANCIS WESTON and his
     FRIENDS. GEORGE is clearly in his element. Laughing in delight.
     Very fond and intimate with FRANCIS WESTON..

     SIR THOMAS looks concerned for the first time.

      n another corner, MARY is in costume, but looking forlorn. She
     watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. Presently,
     a voice behind her..

                         MASKED MAN
            Why look so glum, Mary?

     MARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her.

                         MARY
            What reason have I to be happy?

                         MASKED MAN
             ou have two men, the King of England
            and I, both fighting for your love.

     The MASKED MAN is tall. His voice is quiet, but strong.

                         MARY
            Do I know you?

                         MASKED MAN
            You know me, Mary - but not half as well
            as I know you. I know you better than
            anyone here. And love you better than
            anyone here, too. And if God had made ME
            your husband instead of William Carey,
            one thing I know..
                   (a beat)
            I would never have let you go.

     MARY's smile fades..

                         MARY
            Wait! Who ARE you?

MARY lunges for the MAN's MASK to try and remove it, but the MAN
retreats into the safety of the shadows. Meanwhile..

All around MARY the crowds part, and a deep voice booms out.

                     ASKED MAN #2
       Ah! Who have we here?!?

MARY turns to see a SECOND MASKED MAN, (unmistakably the KING),
surrounded by COURTIERS.
                     M
                    MARY
       My name is Kindness.

                      MASKED MAN #2
           wonder, will you be kind to me?

                    MARY
       What is it you desire?

                    MASKED MAN #2
        our love, fair Lady.

                    MARY
       You demand a great deal.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       No more than I would give in return.

MARY notices her FATHER is among the masked COURTIERS. His eyes
giving MARY cues..

                    MARY
       It is easy for a man to declare love
       from behind a mask.

                     ASKED MAN #2
        ut if I remove it, you might reject me.

                    MARY
       If your feelings were sincere, I would
       never reject you.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       But you do not know who I am? I could be
       ugly. Or poor.

                    MARY
        o matter how you looked. Or who you
       were.

                    MASKED MAN #2
       Really? Then I shall hold you to your
       word. And unmask..!

With a flourish, the KING rips off his mask..

                         MARY
            Your Majesty..!

     SIR THOMAS urgently nods, `Go on!' MARY theatrically swoons.
     Falling into the KING's arms. A gasp among the COURTIERS..

                         HENRY
             he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms!
            Call my physicians..!

     SIR THOMAS quickly picks MARY up. He carries her through the
     crowds, out of the ball-room..

     QUEEN KATHERINE watches from a distance. A flicker of pain.
     Then, with great dignity and pride, she turns back to watch the
     entertainment..


     INT. KING'S APARTMENT - COURT - NIGHT

     `Thump', the doors open, and MARY is carried into the King's
     apartments. HENRY fusses, brings water. Opens windows.

                          ENRY
            Go! Leave us! Go!

     SIR THOMAS bows to the KING, shoots MARY meaningful look, `Don't
     fail me', and retreats. HENRY closes the doors. He and MARY are
     left alone.

     HENRY makes her comfortable.

                         MARY
            Thank you, your Grace.

                         HENRY
            `Henry', please. The first rule of this
            room, is to leave `Your Grace's' and
            `Your Majesty's' outside.

      ENRY looks up..

                         HENRY
            Is there anything I can bring you?

                         MARY
            No.

                         HENRY
            Nothing to increase your comfort or well-
            being?

                         MARY
            You might ask your servants to bring me
            some water.

     HENRY goes to get water himself..

                    HENRY
       There. There ARE no servants.

MARY's eyes widen. The KING of ENGLAND brings her a drink! MARY
takes a sip of her drink and watches as HENRY goes behind a
screen and begins to remove his costume. His mask.

MARY notices a mirror, and watches in the reflection of the
mirror how HENRY removes the costume and status of KING and
becomes a MAN. Private.

 ENRY visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. He breathes out
deeply. His face becomes softer. More gentle. Then he puts on a
comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen.

HENRY goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down - and
smiles at MARY.

                    MARY
       So, this is it? This is where the King
       of England sleeps?

                    HENRY
       And reads. And writes. And finds a few
       moments each day...
              (gestures)
       ...for himself.

HENRY smiles at MARY..

                    HENRY (cont'd)
       You look surprised?

                    MARY
       I am. I suppose it's more..

MARY looks at the bed, the books, the pages of writing on the
desk..

                    MARY
       ..simple than I imagined.

                     ENRY
       There's no need for show. I am only ever
       here alone.

                    MARY
       And yet you invite me here?

                    HENRY
       Because I trust you.

                    MARY
       You hardly know me.

       You would never lie, could never lie to

MARY smiles, admitting he's right.

       No.

                    HENRY
       I also sense...that you might relish an
       opportunity to be yourself, too.

                    MARY
       Yes.

                    HENRY
       Well, here you only say what you like,
       do what you like.
                    M
                    MARY
       Very well.

MARY smiles. Stretches out her legs. Relaxes..

                    MARY
       I'd like an apple, please..
              (can't believe she's saying
               this)
       ..Henry.

HENRY jumps to his feet, brings MARY an apple. MARY laughs,
`Thank you'. Bites into the apple..

                    MARY
       Now it's your turn.

                    HENRY
       What?

                    MARY
       To say something, or do something you
       couldn't outside.

                    HENRY
       There are many things I cannot admit to
       in public. Sadness, for example. And
       loneliness.

                    MARY
       But when you are loved as much as you
       are? How can you be lonely?

                         HENRY
            Do you not know what it is to be lonely
            in a marriage?

                         MARY
            Yes. I do now.

                          ENRY
              married my brother's widow because my
            father ordered it. As a duty. To keep
            the alliance with Spain. And she is a
            remarkable woman. And wife.

     HENRY looks at MARY..

                         HENRY
            But I never looked at her or longed for
            her the way I do you.

     HENRY reaches out. Their hands meet..

                         HENRY
            Imagine how different it might have
            been. For both of us..had we been able
            to chose for ourselves..

     HENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY
     resisting. Then harder..

      ensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the
     canopied bed, and lays her down..

     They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with
     WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine..

     MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets..

     Several hours later:

     WILLIAM STAFFORD is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor
     outside. Finally, the door opens. And MARY emerges from the
     KING's apartment.

                             TAFFORD
            Good morning.

      TAFFORD jumps to his feet. Waking rapidly..

            I have orders to bring you to your
            father.

     MARY stares at STAFFORD. As he straightens his shirt..

                         MARY
            My father..?
                    a beat)
            Well, we'd better not keep him waiting.

     STAFFORD turns, leads the way. MARY follows.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by
     the fire. Slurping hungrily.

     The entire family is gathered. SIR THOMAS, LADY ELIZABETH. Also
     present is WILLIAM CAREY.

                          NORFOLK
            Well..?

     MARY stares at her husband..

                         NORFOLK
            Did he have you?

     MARY's eyes burn..

                          MARY
            Yes.

                         NORFOLK
            More than once?

     MARY stares daggers..

                         NORFOLK
            You'd better get used to talking about
            it. Once you sleep with the king, it's
            not a private matter any more.

                         MARY
            Yes. More than once.

     WILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain..

                         NORFOLK
            So he was satisfied?

                         MARY
            I believe so, Uncle.

                         NORFOLK
             ood. This is where our work begins.
            It's one thing to catch the king. Quite
            another to keep him.

     NORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a
     piece of livestock..

                         NORFOLK
            I want you to keep her spotless, hair
            washed every day. She must read all the
            latest books and be able to venture and
            defend an interesting opinion. She must
            know her music, must be energetic and
            entertaining - in company and in bed.
            That's how he likes his women. And if
            ever she's in any doubt as to how to
            conduct herself, or what to do next -
            she should simply watch the Queen. That
            woman kept him from straying for eleven
            years. And the effort almost killed her.

      ut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from
     a palace window as, in a stableyard down below..

     GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound
     of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the
     stable-boys..

     SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace
     together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy
     between them..

     SIR THOMAS's smile fades.

     `Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a
     magnificent ship on a table. He sits with SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and
     the DUKE of NORFOLK.

                         HENRY
            The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty-
            two guns and two hundred feet long, and
            with your permission Thomas..

                    expensive, grander)
            ..I'd like to name her after your
            daughter. The "Mary Boleyn".

        onsense. She's an angel. It's the least
       she deserves. And if there's anything
       else I can do for YOU, my friend..as an
       expression of my gratitude..let me know.

SIR THOMAS's tails off. Thinking..

                    SIR THOMAS
        s it happens..there is one thing.

                    HENRY
       Name it.

SIR THOMAS has clearly not stopped thinking about what he saw
between GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON..

                    SIR THOMAS
        ur son, George. He's of an age now..

                    HENRY
       You want me to make him a match?

SIR THOMAS bows. Deadly serious..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Yes, your Majesty.

                    HENRY
       Do you have anyone in mind?

                    SIR THOMAS
       There is one lady, Sir..

                    HENRY
       Go on..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Who I fear is too high-born for us. And
       following the unfortunate matter between
       Anne and Henry Percy, I didn't want my
       children to overreach themselves again..

                    HENRY
        verreach themselves?

HENRY can't help smiling..

                    HENRY
       One is currently in the King's bed. If
       they are good enough for me, I suggest
       they're good enough for anyone else.
       So..

     GEORGE BOLEYN, visibly shocked and distressed, stands in front
     of his father.

                          EORGE
            I beg you, Father. No.

                         SIR THOMAS
            She's well connected, her father is
            cousin to the King. And there's money,
            too.

                         GEORGE
            But must I actually...marry her?

     SIR THOMAS's expression changes..

                         SIR THOMAS
              thought you had ambitions for this
            family.      G

            yourself. Not just stand back and watch
            your sisters.

      EORGE nods..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Then my advice would be to start
            behaving like a man. A real man. Do I
            make myself clear?

     SIR THOMAS walks out. GEORGE stares after him..

            Yes, Sir.

     MUSICIANS play. We're at GEORGE's wedding. Attended by the KING
     and QUEEN, all the senior LORDS. It's a markedly grander and
     posher affair than MARY's earlier wedding, a clear indication of
     the BOLEYNS' new, elevated status.

A formation dance is in progress. At the centre of it: GEORGE
dances with a radiant, triumphant JANE PARKER. GEORGE's eyes
meet those of FRANCIS WESTON across the room.

 y contrast: HENRY dances with MARY. A couple with eyes on for
each other. Locked to one another. Blissfully unaware of and
uninterested in anyone else. Silently counting the minutes
before they can tear off one another's clothes..

 EVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

Their intimacy is witnessed by WILLIAM CAREY, who we notice is
now drinking heavily, drowning his jealous sorrows..

ELSEWHERE:

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN is dancing with his wife, LADY ELIZABETH. He
hisses through a fixed smile..

                    SIR THOMAS
       For God's sake, it's the wedding of our
       youngest child attended by the King of
       England and the greatest Lords in the
       Land. Would a smile be too much to ask?

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       What's to smile about? I'm a mother with
       one child on his wedding day looking
       like he's been condemned to death.

 he indicates GEORGE, who dances with JANE PARKER..

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       Another banished abroad, in disgrace.
       And a third whoring in public with an
       adulterer.

                    SIR THOMAS
       For the moment she's happy.

SIR THOMAS watches MARY who dances with the KING..

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       But will she be happy when he leaves
       her? Because you know that's how it will
       end.

                    SIR THOMAS
       Only God knows how anything will end.

                    LADY ELIZABETH
       God..? He turned his back on all this a
       long time ago.

SIR THOMAS stares coldly at his wife. He applauds as the dance
comes to an end.

     IN ANOTHER CORNER:

     MARY and the KING also clap. HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's
     ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side...

     MARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM
     CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly.

                         WILLIAM
            You're in love with him, aren't you?

                         MARY
             illiam, you're drunk.

                         WILLIAM
            How is it? With him?

     MARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him.

                         MARY
            He pleases me. Is that what you want to
            hear?

                         WILLIAM
            What does he do to you? Tell me. I want
            to know..

     MARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY
     sees this from across the room..

                         WILLIAM
            I know you look at me with contempt.
            But I had no choice. Your father
            insisted I stand aside. What was I
            expected to do?

                         MARY
            Say `no', husband.
                   (a beat)
            That was all you had to do.

     MARY pulls her arm away, and goes. She walks across the room,
     visibly shaken, and joins the KING.

     HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of
     themselves..

     Hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms.
     MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms. She lovingly strokes
     his hair. Watches him breathe.

     Her face is glowing. Content. And the look in her eyes tells us
     more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet..

     The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open
     door, we see MARY hunched over her basin, vomiting.
     P
      resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands
     instinctively covering her belly.

     MARY's eyes widen with the implications.

     SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK are having a private audience
     with the KING. SIR THOMAS whispers something in HENRY's ear..

     (WE DO NOT HEAR THE WORDS - WE DO NOT NEED TO).

     HENRY's face breaks out in a smile. He delightedly shakes SIR
     THOMAS's hand. OVER THIS: the sound of a voice..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Now open!

     MARY removes her blindfold. She gasps in disbelief, turns 360
     degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..

                         SIR THOMAS
            There's more. Thanks to you, I am to
            become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount.

      EORGE smiles at MARY, who's eyes widen..

                         SIR THOMAS (cont'd)
            In addition, we have received a number
            of new grants and estates.

            Just be aware. These `gifts', this
            `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes.
            These rooms belonged to the Duke of
            Buckingham. Once the King's closest
            friend. Now his head rots on a spike..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Because he committed treason.

                          ADY ELIZABETH
            But what is `treason'? It's anything the
            King or his lawyers decide it to be.
            Anything that offends him, or causes him
            displeasure.

            that?

     LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. MARY looks anxiously at SIR
     THOMAS, who gestures dismissively..

                         SIR THOMAS
            Pay her no heed..

     MARY wakes up. She gets out of bed. She goes to the window and
     draws the curtains.

     Then MARY looks down, and gasps. The floor has fresh drops of
     blood on it.

     MARY goes to her bed, and rips back the sheets. Her eyes widen
     in horror. There is blood all over the sheets.

     MARY covers her mouth. Lets out a loud cry. The sound of
     approaching footsteps as SERVANTS come running..

     MARY lies on the bed being examined by several PHYSICIANS. SIR
     THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK look on in concern. Finally, the
     PHYSICIAN turns, washing his hands..

                         PHYSICIAN
            Happily, the baby lives. She's not
            miscarried.

     SIR THOMAS's face. Overcome with relief..

                         PHYSICIAN
            But the placenta is weak. For the sake
            of the child..

     The PHYSICIAN clears his throat. This will not be easy..

                         PHYSICIAN
            She must begin her lying-in immediately.

                           MARY
                     (horrified)
            What?

     MARY looks up. Her heart sinks.

                         MARY
            But I'm only three months..


66                                                                66
     INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - COURT - DAY

     MARY lies in her bed, watching with a forlorn expression as
     MIDWIVES and MAIDS prepare the apartment for lying-in.

      APESTRIES with soothing biblical images are hung on the walls.
     CURTAINS are drawn for darkness. A large CRUCIFIX is placed in a
     corner.

     As each TAPESTRY is hung, the room becomes darker...

     ..and darker.

     ..and darker.

     MARY cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as
     possible, but before long..

     ..her face slips into darkness, and the room into total silence.
     And effective imprisonment.

     Darkness. The KING stands at the foot of MARY's bed. He is
     clearly uncomfortable in these `maternal' surroundings..

                         HENRY
             ou poor girl. All alone in here. But
            the time will fly by.

                         MARY
            Will it? It's six months?

                         HENRY
            I know. But the most important thing is
            a healthy child.

      ENRY takes MARY's hand..

                         HENRY (cont'd)
            I'll come and see you as often as I can.

     INT. COURT - DAY

     The KING's birthday. The MASTER OF REVELS has organised a lavish
     ball. The entire court is assembled and dancing, but HENRY
     appears sullen, distant. Unable to celebrate.

     He misses MARY.

      he QUEEN has several of her prettiest SPANISH LADIES-IN WAITING
     surrounding the KING. Giggling, fragrant butterflies.

     But HENRY shows no interest.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK notices this. A flicker of concern.

     An archery competition is in progress. But HENRY pays no
     attention. He sits listlessly to one side. Ill-tempered and
     missing MARY.

      mong the GUESTS are SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and his CHILDREN. They
     notice the KING, all alone. They talk among themselves.

     Sensing an opportunity, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR advances, and presents
     his pretty daughter JANE to the KING.

     The DUKE of NORFOLK, (never far away), notices how modestly and
     demurely young JANE SEYMOUR flirts.

     She has been well trained.

     But she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away.
     Not remotely interested.

      or the moment.

     The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands
     and are talking intimately.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

     This is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS
     BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding..

                         NORFOLK
            For the moment he's still visiting Mary.
            But for how long? The Queen will soon
            have his head spinning with pretty
            little Spanish things. Not to mention
            the Seymours with that girl of theirs.

     NORFOLK looks up...

                         NORFOLK
            What we need is someone from OUR family
            who will keep the King focused on Mary,
            reminding him of her while she is
            absent.

     SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind.

                         NORFOLK
            What? Speak..

                         SIR THOMAS
            It's just...I was going to suggest Anne.

                         NORFOLK
            You couldn't control that girl last
            time. What makes you think it would be
            any different now?

                         SIR THOMAS
            I've had favourable reports from the
            Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is
            quite changed.

     MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..

                         MARY
            Why?

     Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE..

                         GEORGE
            I suppose they felt three years of exile
            was punishment enough.

                         MARY
            But the King visits me every day.
            There's no need for her. Or anyone else.

                         GEORGE
            They just want to protect you. Leave
            nothing to chance.

                         MARY
            But in who's interests do they imagine
            Anne will act? Certainly not mine.

     GEORGE turns, looks all around him..

                         GEORGE (cont'd)
            Why DO they make this room such a
            dungeon? Does it really need to be this
            dark?

     GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression..

                         GEORGE
            Don't worry. She's had three years to
            forgive you. And she's not going to risk
            being sent away again. She'll do as
            she's told, I'm sure.
                   (a beat)
            Besides, the most important thing is..

     GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape..

                         GEORGE
            The three of us will be together again.

     MARY's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile..

     The RIDERS and the WOMAN gallop through villages, spraying mud.
     VILLAGERS stop and stare..

     A MOTHER pulls a child out of the path of the RIDERS.

     HENRY and several of his COURTIERS return from a hunting trip.
     Several dead STAGS are carried on horseback. The atmosphere is
     celebratory. It's been a good day.

     Dogs bark in excitement.

     A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation
     with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the
     table, loud laughter.
     H
      ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation.

     It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner
     of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his
     conversation.

      resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time,
     HENRY loses patience..

                         HENRY
            What's the noise? I can hardly hear
            myself think!

     At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet..

                         BRANDON
            It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her
            stories about life at the French court.
            They are particularly amusing.

     HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent..

                         HENRY
            I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and
            she is lying-in with a certain child in
            her belly!

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN gets to his feet..

                    SIR THOMAS
       It's my elder daughter, Anne, your
       Majesty. She has returned to court.

                    HENRY
       What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one
       that almost killed me?
              (a beat)
       You allowed her back?

                    SIR THOMAS
       The time abroad has done her good, your
       Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much
       improved.

                      HENRY
       Really..?

HENRY looks down the table..

                    HENRY
       Well, come on. Where are you, other
       Boleyn girl? Show your face.

ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees
ANNE's face, his face falls..

ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy
fat and lack of confidence.

ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in
daring French clothes.

 er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. Her neckline
plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring
flashes of arm and elbow..

Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly
mesmerised. Speechless..

                    HENRY
       So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we
       might hear and judge for ourselves?

ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all
sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though
they are the only two people in the room..

                    ANNE
       I was just giving my thoughts on the new
       French King.

                      HENRY
       Which are..?

                    ANNE
       That for someone with such great wealth,
       and power..he has surprisingly little
       authority as a man.

                    HENRY
       Hah!

                    ANNE
       And is SO consumed by one particular
       rivalry he can barely think.

                    HENRY
        eally? And who is this rival?

                    ANNE
       A neighbouring King, who's name one is
       forbidden to mention at court. Whose
       reputation haunts him in his thoughts
       and dreams.

 ipples of laughter, as people guess..

                    ANNE
       Whose armies and navy thwart his every
       endeavour. Whose physical and
       intellectual endowments are known far
       and wide.

 ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..

                    ANNE
       In order to restore his confidence, this
       French King spends a fortune on anything
       that glitters, on building of castles
       with large towers..

ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..

                    ANNE
       But these symbols of wealth and virility
       fail to convince. Talk among the ladies
       at court in France suggests..
A
ANNE stops herself...

                    HENRY
       What?

                    ANNE
       That in this department too, the King
       has his shortcomings.

ANNE's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). HENRY
stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?

     Then HENRY smiles. Delighted. DOGS bark in bewilderment. Soon
     everyone in the room laughs too.

      xcept for the SEYMOURS, (SIR JOHN and his sons, EDWARD and
     THOMAS), who glower, mute, at the end of the table beside their
     sister JANE..

     SIR THOMAS beams with excitement and satisfaction...

            You should have seen the Seymours! Their
            faces!

     MARY lies in bed. Sitting by her side is her father..

                         SIR THOMAS
            They must have thought that with you out
            of the way, they had a real opportunity
            with that pale-faced thing of theirs,
            Jane...

     SIR THOMAS smiles as he remembers..

                         SIR THOMAS (cont'd)
            But Anne put pay to that. Last night,
            the King only had eyes for us Boleyns.

     MARY shoots a private, knowing look..

                         MARY
            Or HER, you mean.

                         SIR THOMAS
            What?

                         MARY
             'm wary of any suggestion that Anne
            would serve anyone but herself. France
            can't have changed her THAT much.

                         SIR THOMAS
             n this occasion I am quite satisfied
            she was being loyal to you.

                         MARY
            Really?

     MARY stares hollow-eyed..

                         MARY (cont'd)

     HENRY and several of his closest COURTIERS are sparring close-
     combat sword fighting. It's tough, physical, no-holds barred
     stuff..

     AFTERWARDS: HENRY and his COURTIERS, (among them GEORGE), are
     being undressed and washed by their PAGES and SQUIRES..

                         HENRY
            You're a fortunate man, George. To be
            blessed with G
                         two such sisters.

                            EORGE
            Yes, my Lord.

     There is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY
     which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE.

                          ENRY
            Tell me. Are they as different in temper
            as they are in looks?

                         GEORGE
            Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite
            distinct virtues. Mary for example..

                         HENRY
            I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about
            Anne's.

                         GEORGE
            Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say
            `difficult'.

                          ENRY
            Headstrong. With a fiery temper.

                         GEORGE
            But with it comes great passion, too.
            It's both the best and the worst thing
            about her.
                    a beat)
            There are no half measures with Anne.

                         HENRY
            Careful, you'll make me think I chose
            the wrong Boleyn girl.

                         GEORGE
            Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the   right
            choice. You will have a serene,   happy,
            life with her. The risk is with   Anne, it
            might be like being caught in a   wild
            summer storm.

                         HENRY
            Is that so..?

     GEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the
     wrong thing.

                           HENRY
                storm, you say..?

     A small, precious-looking GIFT BOX sits on a table.

                          ERVANT
            From the King, madam.

     ANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the
     unmistakable royal seal.

                          ANNE
            Open it.

     A SERVANT stares..

                         ANNE
            I said `open it.'

     The SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on
     tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps.
     ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful..

     But from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..

                         ANNE
            Now close it again. And send it back.

     The SERVANT stares in disbelief..

                         ANNE (cont'd)
            You heard me.

     The SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a
     look of mischief in her eyes. She's up to no good.

                         SERVANT
            Sent it back, your Grace.

            Sent it back?

     ANNE shakes her head, and sends the gift back. She looks
     anxious. Knows this is a high risk game she's playing.

     The MESSENGER stands in front of the KING, holding the rejected

     The KING is in a meeting with several AMBASSADORS on an
     important matter. The doors open. He looks up to see..

     `Crash', the KING, flanked by several of his most intimidating
     COURTIERS, bursts through doors, and storms along a corridor.
     It's an impressive sight..

     People scatter to get out of the way.

     The KING bursts in. Everyone leaps to their feet. SERVANTS stop
     and stare and curtsey. LADY ELIZABETH bows, clearly thrown..

                         LADY ELIZABETH
            Your Majesty.

     HENRY turns full circle, looking for someone..

                         HENRY
            Your daughter. Where is she?

                         LADY ELIZABETH

     ANNE hears the KING's voice. Her eyes widen. She looks down.
     Sees HENRY. ANNE smiles privately - it's confirmation that her
     strategy has worked.

      t that moment, HENRY sees her, calls out, `Anne!'. ANNE's smile
     fades.

      ENRY dashes up the stairs..

     ANNE, who is not properly dressed for the KING, rushes back to
     her room. HENRY follows. ANNE closes the door..

                         ANNE
            On the contrary, my Lord. They pleased
            me greatly.

                         HENRY

     ANNE steps into the corridor. Closes the door behind her.

                         ANNE
             ecause my sister lies in bed with your
            child. If you wish to please me, Sir,
            then send her the gifts you send me.

                         HENRY
            I have shown Mary enough kindness and
            generosity. It's you I want, Anne.

                         ANNE
              beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What
            has changed so?

                         HENRY
            YOU. Don't you see? YOU have changed.

                         ANNE
            But Mary is still the mother of your
            child. And even if she weren't..

            above me when we first met? You liked
            her better.

                         HENRY
            Not true..

                         ANNE

                           HENRY

      ENRY goes on bended knee, kisses her hand, and goes. ANNE is
     left alone. She breathes out. Then looks down at her hands.

      hey are shaking.

     SIR THOMAS is asleep. The sound of voices. A commotion outside.
     The sound of banging on his door..

     MARY cries out in pain. The contractions become stronger.
     MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS urgently do their business. Pots of
     boiling water. Primitive surgical instruments.

         PRIEST arrives, ready to perform the last rites..

       He's on his way.

ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress.

MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way.
Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair..

No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands.
PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments..

Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS..

                    SIR THOMAS
       Any moment, your Grace.

But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as
if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands
beside her..

All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth
unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE
might as well be in a rose garden..

                    HENRY
       Anne..

ANNE stares ahead at MARY's bed..

                    HENRY
       Anne, I love you..

       Your Grace, this is not the time..

       I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking
       about you. I cannot eat, I cannot
       sleep..

       But how could I ever TRUST you?

NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen..

                    ANNE
       When I have seen how you have betrayed
       first your wife. And now my sister.

HENRY takes ANNE to one side...

                    HENRY
       I vow from this moment forth I will
       never lie with my wife, or speak to your
       sister again. I will do anything you
       ask..

MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and
MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..

                    ANNE
       Then don't acknowledge the child.

HENRY is thrown..

                    HENRY
       What?

With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR
THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see..

                    PHYSICIAN
       A boy!

SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness..

                    SIR THOMAS
       It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong,
       healthy boy.

HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he
has waited for. A son.

ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again..

                    ANNE
       What my sister has given you, I could,
       too.

HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are
full of conflict, then..he silently nods.

ANNE's face breaks out in a smile..

                    ANNE
       Very well.

Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is,
HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it.

The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY
falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand..

       Henry..?

HENRY gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without
looking in the direction of MARY or the BABY.

                    MARY (cont'd)
       My Lord..?

MARY stares after the KING, but he does not turn around.

     Instead, MARY's eyes meet ANNE's.

     ANNE's eyes stare back. The ultimate moment of revenge.

       barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then ANNE turns and
     goes.

     The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly
     embarrassed by what they have just witnessed.

     The clearing of throats, averting of eyes. Then they get on with
     their work to the sound of the MARY's cries..


     INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - NIGHT
97                                                               97
     `Crash', SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst into the study, angrily
     slamming the door closed behind them. ANNE is inside.

                         NORFOLK
            Damn you! Three years we've been working
            on this! Not a single detail was left to
            chance! And now, in the moment of our
            greatest glory..

     NORFOLK stares at ANNE..

                         NORFOLK
            All I can say is you'd better have a
            plan. And it had better work.

     ANNE stares back defiantly..

                         ANNE
            Or what...Uncle?

                         LADY ELIZABETH
            Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do
            about Mary? And the child? Or have we
            forgotten them already?

                         ANNE
            Mary should go back to her husband.

     Not a flicker of emotion on her face.

                         ANNE
            She has been inconvenienced long enough
            by this family.

                          ADY ELIZABETH
            Fine. Then you can be the one to tell
            her.

      ADY ELIZABETH stares at ANNE..

      ANNE stares into the room through a crack in the doorway.

      A flicker of doubt. What has she done? To her own sister?

      ANNE checks herself. Enough sentiment. She swallows it.

       nd enters.

      MARY looks up as ANNE enters, and freezes..

                          MARY
             How can you show your face in here?

                          ANNE
             I understand you're angry - but be
             assured. I did nothing, except remind
             him of you.

                          MARY
             Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately.
             As revenge.
                    (a beat)
             And now you have what you wanted you
             probably think justice has been done.

                          ANNE
             Well, hasn't it?

                          MARY
             Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from
             my experience. Because he'll only do to
             you what he has done to me.

                          ANNE
             Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm
             a greater thing by far. That he can
             never have me until he makes me a far
             greater offer.

                          MARY
             You'll never get Henry Percy back, if
             that's what you mean.

                          ANNE
             That's not what I mean.

      ANNE's eyes burn with anger..

                          ANNE
             And don't you ever mention his name to
             me again. I'll never forget how you
             betrayed me.

                          MARY
             If that's what you think, fine. Tell
             yourself that.

                          ANNE
             I did, sister. Every day for three
             years.

      ANNE turns, and walks out.

      MARY is leaving COURT. Pale. Weak. Her belongings have been
      packed into boxes. Ahead of her, the BABY is being carried by
      MIDWIVES, led by WILLIAM STAFFORD.

      MARY walks across a courtyard, then stops in her tracks.

       VER BY THE STABLES: the KING and ANNE are mounting horses to go
      riding together. HENRY lifts ANNE up into the saddle behind him,
      (how she has learned!). ANNE holds tight, her arms wrapped
      around his waist..

      At that moment, ANNE looks over and sees MARY. Their eyes meet.
      They stare for a beat, then..

      ANNE kicks HENRY's horse, `Hah!', and they ride out. Galloping
      into the distance.

      MARY's face: fighting to hold onto her dignity. WILLIAM STAFFORD
      watches her, his eyes burning with sympathy.

      REVERSE ANGLE: to reveal, this is all being watched by QUEEN
      KATHERINE, from a palace window above..

      QUEEN KATHERINE turns, and coldly lets the curtain drop..


      EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

      MARY and her entourage travel through the countryside in a small
      caravan of horses and wagons. It's raining heavily.

      The rain continues. MARY's carriage approaches the manor house.
      At one time this was everything she wanted. Now it's a prison.


      INT. MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
104                                                              104
      MARY sits at the dinner table with her husband, WILLIAM CAREY,
      who's health has deteriorated. He drinks heavily. A shadow of
      his former self.

      He stares at the BABY..
                           W
                          WILLIAM

      A painful smile..

                          WILLIAM
             And is he to take my name? Or is he to
             be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he
             is a royal bast...

                          MARY
             He is to be Henry Carey.

                            WILLIAM
             I see.

      A silence, then..

                          WILLIAM
             Well, then, here we are.

      WILLIAM stares at MARY. Clearly still in love with her.

                          WILLIAM
             I could pretend none of this ever
             happened. Start again.

      MARY lies in bed, her eyes open and staring blankly at the moon
      outside, as WILLIAM CAREY makes love to her.

      After a short, frenzied thrashing..he climaxes, then as before,
      rolls over and falls asleep.

      MARY stares at the ceiling.

      HENRY and ANNE walk through the gardens. Out of earshot of the
      entire court which is assembled outside..

                          HENRY
             Well, I have done what you asked. Will
             you give yourself to me, now?

                             ANNE
             As what?

                          ANNE
             But it's not true. You are loyal to the
             QUEEN above all others.

                          HENRY
             My wife? I barely see her.

                          ANNE
             But she sits on a throne beside you.
             Accompanies you to every state function.

                           ENRY
             For appearance sakes only. In every
             other regard, our marriage is a sham.

                          ANNE
             Still, she is your WIFE. And ever
             present. And I feel her eyes on me. And
             those of her spies.

      ANNE nervously looks left and right..

                          ANNE
             And look at us. Forever reduced to
             meeting in secret like this. Speaking in

      ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to WOLSEY. We do not
      hear their dialogue, but the two MEN are having a heated
      discussion. Voices are raised.

      WOLSEY pleads with the KING to be reasonable. HENRY silences him
      angrily, then walks out..

      ANNE enters a lavish drawing-room, and sits down. She picks up a
      book, and pretends to be reading. HENRY enters, sidles up behind
      ANNE, putting his arms around her, then..

                          HENRY
             Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for
             the Queen to be sent to a nunnery.

      HENRY kisses ANNE on the neck..

             She will protest, of course. She won't
             go quietly, but she knows she has failed
             to give me a son, and deserves her

             So, is this assurance enough? Will you

                          HENRY
             Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?

                          ANNE
             But that's wonderful.

      ANNE's smiles, then notices..

                          ANNE
             Why do you look sad?

                          HENRY
             Because she will contest it. Which means
             putting her on trial. And hearing these
             delicate matters in public.

                          ANNE
              es. But any court made up of YOUR
             Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour.
             And declare the marriage invalid.

      Now it's ANNE's turn to start kissing HENRY round the neck..

                          ANNE
              hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to
             remarry.
                    (sensing his arousal)
             Then I can give myself to you fully.
                     kissing him lower, lower..)
             And give you everything you..
                    (a beat)
             ..desire.

      ANNE stops, leaving HENRY highly aroused..

      It's mid-winter. A lone RIDER appears on the snowy crest of the
      hill looking down on Rochford Hall.

       t's WILLIAM STAFFORD, (now bearded). He kicks his horse. Rides
      down towards the house.

      A fire roars. STAFFORD warms himself, staring at MARY's new baby
      daughter, (CATHERINE), in a a cot.

                           TAFFORD
             She's beautiful.

                          MARY
             Thank you.

                          STAFFORD
             I brought gifts from your family. A
             night-dress from your mother.
                    (to YOUNG HENRY)
             This from your Uncle George.

      STAFFORD produces a small wooded sword from behind his back.
      Little HENRY takes the sword. Swooshes it with excitement.

                          MARY
             Please be sure to thank them - though
             one wonders what's kept them so busy
             that not a single one of them found time
             to visit the new baby.

                          STAFFORD
             It's Anne. She's turning this country on
             its head. She has persuaded the king to
             test the validity of his marriage, and
             put the QueenM on trial.

                            MARY
             What?

                          STAFFORD
             She continues to hold out. Expertly
             witholding her favours until...

                          MARY
             ..until what?

                          STAFFORD
             Until he makes her the ultimate offer.

      MARY's eyes widen..

                          MARY
             High stakes indeed.

      MARY follows STAFFORD out to the stables where freshly watered
      and fed horses are waiting..

                          MARY
             And my brother George?

                           TAFFORD
             Continues to be promoted. As does your
             Father. I lost track of their latest
             titles.

      STAFFORD smiles. Mounts his horse..

                          STAFFORD
              ow is your husband? I heard he was
             unwell.

                            MARY
             He is.

                            STAFFORD
             I'm sorry.

      STAFFORD stares at her. Their eyes meet. STAFFORD opens his
      mouth, for a moment it looks as if he's about to finally declare
      his feelings, then..

                            WILLIAM (O.S.)
             Mary..!

      WILLIAM CAREY's voice calls out from inside. STAFFORD's
      expression changes. Now's not the right time.

      He kicks his horse, and rides off.


114                                                              114
      INT. ROCHFORD HALL - BEDROOM - DAY

      WILLIAM CAREY lying in bed, emaciated, coughing blood, weak and
      sick, calls out for help, `Mary!'

      INT. ROCHFORD HALL - CORRIDOR - DAY

      MARY walks down a corridor towards her husband's bedroom. As she
      goes, she passes a window. She stops. And looks out.

      In the distance is WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse. Reaching the brow
      of a hill..


      EXT. HILL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
116                                                              116
      At that precise moment, WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse reaches the top
      of the hill..

                            STAFFORD
                      (pulling horse up)
             Whoa..

      STAFFORD turns, and faces back down at the house. He takes a
      last look. For a moment there is a connection between them both.

       hen, he turns, and kicks his horse, and rides over the brow.

      MARY watches him go, then stops - catches herself feeling
      something for the first time. Then she turns and walks along the
      corridor..

      ..back in the direction of WILLIAM CAREY's coughing.

      A hall filled with LAWYERS and AMBASSADORS from both sides.
      Arguably the grandest, most significant divorce proceedings in
      history.

      ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to CARDINAL WOLSEY.
      Then HENRY turns. He walks towards ANNE.

                          HENRY
             The Queen has insisted a Papal
             representative be present at the trial.
             But Wolsey has assured me the trial will
             proceed for appearance sake only. We
             have our verdict.

                          ANNE
             Then what troubles you?

                          HENRY
             One or two friends have refused to lend
             their support. Among them, Thomas More.
                    (a beat)
             And then there's the small matter of my
             conscience.

                          ANNE
             Why? You have justice on your side.

      HENRY stares, conflicted..

                          HENRY
             Do I?

      ANNE strokes his head. Pacifying him. But the look on her face
      tells us - this is getting harder and harder.

      HENRY sits at breakfast. Reading official correspondence. Legal
      documents. And private letters.

       e sorts through the various scrolls, matters of state, then
      finds one. A letter in a hand he does not recognise.

      A quizzical look. HENRY cracks the seal and begins to reads the
      letter. Presently, his expression changes.

      Then his face darkens ominously. His knuckles whiten..

      `Crash', the door flies open. SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst in.
      ANNE is in the bath. She covers herself..

                          SIR THOMAS
             `Mary Talbot'.

             Who?

                           SIR THOMAS
             Mary Talbot!! The girl that married
             Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned
             the King, demanding a divorce from her
             husband( on the grounds..
                     he can hardly bring himself
                     to say the words)
             ...that his prior betrothal to you was
             actually..
                    (his knuckles whiten)
             ..consummated.

      ANNE's eyes widen in horror..`What?'

                          SIR THOMAS
             I knew this would come back to haunt us!

                          ANNE
             I must go to the King.

                          SIR THOMAS
             No! He doesn't want to see you! Or hear
             a word from your lips! He's far too
             angry.

             It seems the only Boleyn he will speak
             to, the only person who's testimony he
             will trust in this matter..
                    (a beat)

      A cemetery in mid-winter. WILLIAM CAREY's coffin is lowered into
      the ground. MARY, dressed in window's black, steps forward, take
      a shovel, throws earth on the grave.

      MARY walks back to comfort the CHILDREN. The elderly PRIEST
      continues with the service.

      MARY bows her head. Then she senses someone's eyes are on her.
      She looks up, and her expression changes..

      There is GEORGE. Her brother. Standing among the handful of
      mourners. Staring at her.

      The entire BOLEYN family is assembled. SIR THOMAS, LADY
      ELIZABETH, the DUKE of NORFOLK, GEORGE and, at the centre of
      proceedings, ANNE herself.

      The atmosphere is tense. Presently, the door opens, and MARY
      enters the room. In widow's weeds. All eyes on her. And her
      CHILDREN. A sharp intake of breath, a ripple of shock at the
      state of them. In simple country clothes. MARY curtseys..

                            SIR THOMAS
             Mary.

       n awkward silence. MARY holds her CHILDREN's hands..

      Several MAIDS are assembled, fussing over MARY. Transforming her
      from penniless country widow to sophisticated courtier again.

      ANNE enters, (unseen by MARY), and ushers everyone out. She
      takes the brush from the departing SERVANT, and continues to
      brush MARY's hair.

             us. I wanted to come to see you after
             your daughter was born, and again when
             your husband died, but..

      The KING sits in his private apartment. He looks up as MARY
      enters, and curtseys deeply. Seeing MARY, his DOG
      enthusiastically greets her. Lapping at her.

      MARY looks at the KING. She is overcome with emotion, but finds
      the strength to hide it..

                          HENRY
             Ah! Mary! Come in.

      MARY walks closer.

                    (beckons)

             The Other Boleyn Girl. I'd forgotten how
             beautiful you were.

      MARY emerges from the King's apartments.

       er entire FAMILY stares expectantly at her. ANNE steps forward,
      barely able to conceal her anxiety..

                          ANNE
             And..?

      MARY is putting the children to bed, tucking YOUNG HENRY in.

                           OUNG HENRY
             Mama? What's the matter?

      MARY's face: visibly upset. Her hands shaking.

                          MARY
                    (putting brave face on)
             Nothing.

      MARY smiles, tenderly kisses YOUNG HENRY.

      ANNE appears in the doorway. Watches through a half-open door.
      Notes how loving MARY is as a mother..

      MARY gets to her feet. Walks towards ANNE.


      INT. CORRIDOR - BOLEYN APARTMENTS - NIGHT
128                                                            128
      MARY closes the door behind her. ANNE stares at her, then..

                          ANNE
                    (with difficulty)
             I am forever in your debt.

                          MARY
             You owe me nothing, sister. I did it
             that we may finally draw a line beneath
             everything that has happened between us.

                          ANNE
              hen let it be exactly that. A new start
             between us. Here at court.

      ANNE embraces MARY, who stiffens.

                          MARY
             Thank you. But I'd rather go back to our
             home in the country.

                          ANNE
             What? That damp old ruin? With no food?
             Or warmth?
                     a beat)
             Why don't you let your family look after
             you? Your children would have the best
             of everything here. They would grow up
             safe and secure.

      MARY stares, horrified. But before she can reply...

      The sound of a commotion, from outside. The sound of trumpets.
      The unmistakable noise of arriving SOLDIERS.

       veryone rushes to a window. Looks down to see a small ARMY.

       t the centre of everything: an grand, old, bearded ARCHBISHOP
      climbs down from an opulent carriage.

                           MARY
              ho's that?

                          SIR THOMAS
             The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to
             preside over the Queen's trial.

      MARY looks first at ANNE, then back out as the long procession
      dramatically enters the Palace Gates.

                          MARY
             So, it's true. It's really happening?

      ANNE suddenly looks pale. Vulnerable. Frightened.

                          ANNE
             Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need
             my sister by me side.

      A huge crowd is assembled. Despite the intimidating presence of
      the KING's GUARDS, the people shout vigorously in support of
      QUEEN KATHERINE. Crying out her name. The QUEEN arrives.

       ast cheers go up.

      We're in a packed courtroom. The room is filled with the
      country's highest-ranking bishops. To one side: ANNE and MARY
      watch from behind a screen..

MARY hears the CROWD's cheering for the QUEEN. Screams of
support and affection, `Long live Queen Katherine', `Our one
true Queen'. MARY looks anxious..

                    MARY
       The crowds are with her.

                    ANNE
       The crowds have no vote.

       And the bishops that do are in Wolsey's
       pocket.

ANNE watches as KATHERINE enters court. The QUEEN sees ANNE, and
starts walking directly towards them..

                    ANNE (cont'd)
       God, she's coming towards us.

QUEEN KATHERINE walks towards the screen, reaches it, then
                     Q
pushes it aside, intimidatingly flanked by her LAWYERS..

                     UEEN KATHERINE
       So..the Boleyn whores. Two former ladies
       of mine. Hiding in shadows.
              (a beat)
       What did I do to upset you, that you
       should turn against me like this?

                    ANNE
       You failed to give England an heir.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       And that upsets you so?

                    ANNE
       What upsets the King upsets me.

QUEEN KATHERINE straightens. Big mistake.

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
       How dare you!

                    CRIER
              (calling out)
       Katherine, Queen of England, come into
       court..!

KATHERINE's LAWYERS try to drag her away from ANNE, but she
wrenches herself free..

                    QUEEN KATHERINE
        ou want me to creep away and become a
       nun? Well, I shall not. You want me to
       lie before God and admit my first
       marriage was consummated? Well, it was
       not.

                     Q retire and withdraw my
       daughter's claim as sole rightful heir
       to the throne? Well I shall not. Not in
       a thousand years, not if you rack me to
       within an inch of my life...
              (beat)
       I am Katherine, Queen of England, the
       King's one true wife, and mother of the
       heir to the throne. Beloved of the
       people, and beloved of a King you have
       bewitched.

KATHERINE turns and enters the packed courtroom. She makes no
reply to the CRIER, instead walks over to where the KING sits,
and falls onto her knees..

MARY looks at ANNE, who is visibly shaking. And tries to compose
herself.

Throughout the courtroom, people exchange looks. Gasp. KATHERINE
is completely disregarding the court, Campeggio and Wolsey, and
appealing directly to her husband..

                    KATHERINE
       My Lord, how have I offended you? For
       twenty years, I have been a true,
       obedient wife. I have loved all those
       whom you loved, and given you children
       though it has pleased God to take them
       away. If there is any just cause that
       you can allege against me, I will
       happily depart to my shame and
       dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my
       witness, there is none.

 ENRY sits in silence, but can barely contain his rage.

                     ATHERINE (cont'd)
       So, I beg you, dear husband, to spare me
       this humiliation. But if you will not,
       and I am to be tried..

                    HENRY
              (defiant)
       You are.

                    KATHERINE
       ..then let it be in a proper court and
       by the only authority I recognise. His
       holiness himself.

An audible gasp from the court. HENRY shoots a look at WOLSEY,
`What?!?' WOLSEY is horrified, `I know nothing of this.'
KATHERINE gets to her feet, and dramatically walks out of the
court, stopping only to pause by a window..

      The cheers from the loyal PEOPLE who are waiting outside ring
      through the court. HENRY looks dark, thunderous. He storms out
      of court. WOLSEY watches, visibly shaken...

                          WOLSEY
             Since it has pleased the Queen to absent
             herself from the court, the trial will
             simply proceed without her.

      A LAWYER gets to his feet. The trial begins..


      INT. BOLEYN FAMILY HOME - NIGHT
131                                                            131
      The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled. ANNE paces up and down.
      MARY is with her children..

                          ANNE
             Wolsey promised the King his verdict.
             Instead he has humiliated him.

                          SIR THOMAS
             But they are continuing with the trial.
             And the Bishops will still find in the
             King's favour.

                          ANNE
             Yes. But without the Pope's blessing,
             the result will seem hollow.
                     a frustrated gesture)
             If only the King would take matters into
             his own hands.

                           ADY ELIZABETH
             And do what? His only option would be
             to reject the Catholic Church? And his
             faith would never allow it.

                          SIR THOMAS
             Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome
             would isolate England politically. Leave
             us at the mercy of the Protestants.

                          ANNE
             But the alternative is leaving this
             country without an heir. Failing in his
             duty as a King. And risking civil war.

      ANNE stops thinks..

      ANNE's face: an idea forming..

             A strong, rosy-cheeked boy..

      HENRY, along with THOMAS CROMWELL and several of his LAWYERS are
      walking along a corridor. They turn a corner, then stop.

      HENRY freezes. He's seen something. And the impact of it has
      made him stop in his tracks.

      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

      In the gardens outside, are ANNE and YOUNG HENRY, playing.

      The KING's face: it's as if all sound goes silent. He stares,
      transfixed, at the boy. He hears nothing except YOUNG HENRY's
      laughter. He sees nothing except YOUNG HENRY's golden locks.

      MARY watches from a distance, her heart cracking as HENRY
      dismisses CROMWELL and the LAWYERS, and goes out to join ANNE
      and YOUNG HENRY.

       t seems to have a profound affect on him..

      HENRY walks towards ANNE. And bends so as not to frighten the
      boy..

                            HENRY
             Who's this?

             Is it, now? A fine name.
                    (raises eyebrow)
             And how old are you?

                           YOUNG HENRY
             Four, Sir.

      REVERSE ANGLE: to see MARY watching helplessly from inside the
      palace. Tears are streaming down her face. LADY ELIZABETH
      appears, and puts her arm round MARY's shoulders in comfort..

      OUTSIDE: in the gardens, YOUNG HENRY and his father continue to
      get to know one another..

                          YOUNG HENRY (cont'd)
             Is that sword real?

                          HENRY
             I think so. Would you like to see it?

      HENRY draws it, and shows the boy, who's eyes widen in
      excitement..

                          HENRY
             Now, `on guard'.

      HENRY and YOUNG HENRY begin to play fight. As they do, our
      CAMERA slowly, slowly pulls back to reveal..

      The scene is being watched by:

      MARY, her nose pressed against a window in the palace, as she
      continues to watch HENRY play with her SON..

      QUEEN KATHERINE, screaming in protest, surrounded by wailing
      LADIES-IN-WAITING, is dragged roughly away from court by a unit
      of ARMED GUARDS..

             Take your hands off me..

      The GUARDS drag the QUEEN away, her heart-breaking kicking and
      screaming continues. As she disappears..

      We REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this is being watched shadows by the
      KING himself..

      His face: burning with guilt and self-loathing.

      The door flies open. ANNE is reading, alone. She looks up to see
      HENRY, his eyes ablaze..

                          HENRY
             Now you will give yourself to me.

      ANNE looks up..

                          ANNE
             I thought I had made myself clear. Until
             we are married, there is no questi..

             Silence! Enough of your GAMES!
                    (tearing at her dress)
             I have torn apart this country for you,
             gone against every principle in my
             heart, I've endured the doubts and
             counsel of good men and silenced them
             with the axe...just to be with you..

      HENRY tears her dress. He forces himself on top of her.

             Now prove to me it was worth the
             sacrifice.

      He pushes her back against a table, slamming her down, and
      enters her roughly. ANNE cries out in pain..

                          ANNE
             Stop, you are hurting me..!

      That night: ANNE is being groomed by MARY.

                          ANNE
             How was he with you? As a lover?

                          MARY

             No reason.

      OVER THIS we FADE IN: the sound of bells ringing..

      A small ceremony. Held in secret. The distant sound of crowds
      protesting. Booing. Jeering. MARY watches from the shadows as
      ARCHBISHOP CRANMER marries HENRY and a visibly pregnant ANNE..

                          ARCHIBISHOP
                    (in LATIN, we see sub-titles)
             Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as
             your lawful wedded wife..?

      HENRY's face: eyes burning with self-loathing..

                          HENRY
             I do.

      Their voices are almost drowned by the SHOUTS of protest and
      dissent coming from the streets..`Whore', `Witch'.

A party is in progress. ANNE, the bride, is at the centre of
proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally Queen. But it has
brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly
troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour.

                    ANNE
       Did you hear? On the way to the church?
       They were calling me a witch.

                    MARY
       All that will die down as soon as they
       get to know you.

                    ANNE
       But what if it doesn't? What if they
       hate me forever?

                    MARY
       They won't. They will see how much the
       King loves you, and follow.

                    ANNE
              (haunted, hollow)
       How much the King loves me?

ANNE shoots an anxious look over at HENRY, who is with CROMWELL,
in the corner, lost in serious conversation..

                    MARY
        ister, I wonder if you've given any
       thought..to the matter of my returning
       to the country. With the children.

ANNE's face: her expression changes. Suddenly fearful.

                    ANNE
       What? No! I need you here more than
       ever. Besides, as the Queen's sister,
       you can't live alone out there like some
       gypsy. We need to make you a proper
       match.

 earing this, the passing WILLIAM STAFFORD freezes..

                    ANNE
       What about the Duke of Suffolk?

ANNE indicates an ugly, fat COURTIER..

                    ANNE
       All the ladies at court are mad for him.
       Or Lord Fardingly.
               indicates an OLD courtier,
               in his 60's)
       Marry him and you'd own half Scotland..

      MARY is walking back to her apartments, when WILLIAM STAFFORD
      runs after her, appearing in the corridor behind her..

                            STAFFORD
             Wait! Mary..

      STAFFORD catches her up..

                          STAFFORD
             I couldn't help overhearing. And before
             you agree to any of your sister's
             matches, let me just say..

      STAFFORD takes a deep breath. His heart racing..

                          STAFFORD
             ..I have saved money...not a lot...but
             enough. I've my eye on a place in the
             West...Tatton...near where I grew up..

      MARY turns, an incredulous look..

                            MARY
              hat?
                    (surely this is a joke)
             Stafford?

       TAFFORD blurts it out..

                          STAFFORD
             Mary...I love you. There..I've said it.
             From the moment I joined your family..

                            MARY
             Wait..

      MARY looks at him. A lightening flash of recognition. She's
      heard those words before, and puts two and two together..
                           M
                          MARY
             It was you, wasn't it? At the masked
             ball?

                            STAFFORD
             Yes.

                          MARY
             Oh, Stafford..

                          STAFFORD
             Mary..I have watched how your family has
             treated you.

             dying day..

                          MARY
             But it's impossible. You know that. Now
             Anne's Queen, my family would never
             allow it.

                          STAFFORD
             And you would CARE? What THEY think?
             After everything they have done to you?

       TAFFORD stares incredulously. Then goes.

      MARY's face. Lost in thought. STAFFORD's words still ringing in
      her ears. She sits at the foot of ANNE's bed. ANNE sits in bed.
      Heavily pregnant. On the other side is GEORGE.

                          ANNE
             God, I look hideous.

                             EORGE
             Does it hurt?

                          ANNE
             Little nips and stabs.

      MARY isn't listening. She is lost in thought.

                          GEORGE
             Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy
             trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt
             to the next King of England.

                          ANNE
             But if it isn't? The King will take that
             as evidence of God's displeasure. And
             will turn further against me. He's
             already become so cold.

      ANNE touches her stomach anxiously..

                          ANNE
             They say you can tell by the shape of
             the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy
             or girl?

      ANNE tails off when she sees MARY. Miles away.

                          ANNE
             What's the matter with her?

      MARY looks up, `What?'

             What?

                    (flustered)
             In love!

      MARY returns to her book, flicking pages. But privately she is
      shocked. Is it that obvious?

      A darkened room. ANNE screams out. She is in the middle of
      giving birth. With a bone-chilling scream, a head appears..

                          MIDWIFE
             And again, one more..

      ANNE pushes again. MARY holds her. ANNE howls in agony. Her
      nails dig into the sheets. A last, primal, blood-curdling roar
      of pain..

                          MIDWIFE
             It's done, your Majesty..!

                            MARY
             Well done...

      PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES swarm around the baby. ANNE, despite
      having lost a great deal of blood, tries to sit up..

                            ANNE
             And..?

                            MARY
             It's a girl!

      MARY takes the child from the MIDWIFE, holds it for ANNE.

                          MARY
             A beautiful, healthy girl.

      ANNE is overcome by maternal love, but realises what this will
      mean. She stares at the baby. Fear filling her eyes..

      MARY watches from a distance, as SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK tell the
      King. HENRY staggers from the disappointment, as if he had been
      delivered a blow..

                          SIR THOMAS
             She has named her Elizabeth. After your
             mother.

                          HENRY
             Is the child healthy?

                          SIR THOMAS
             Perfectly, Sir.

      HENRY stares, hollow-eyed. Finally..

                           ENRY
             Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,
             we can have a healthy son.

      HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and
      leaves. ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking..

      MARY stares at ANNE. A stab of compassion. Not long ago the same
      thing happened to her. Hoping to console ANNE, MARY hands her
      beautiful new BABY over to her...

      ..ANNE takes the BABY in her arms. Filled with love for
      something that will almost certainly mean her destruction.

      Her shoulders shake with tears.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

      ANNE stands by a window, staring out. Her hands wringing with
      anxiety. MARY is in another corner, tending to baby ELIZABETH..

                            ANNE

      MARY leaves the BABY, goes over to the window. Looks out. Down
      below, HENRY is walking with an attractive young LADY..

                          MARY
             Lady Somerset, I believe.

             Countess of Salisbury.
                    (a frustrated gesture)
             How could he DO that to me? So SOON?

      MARY pulls away her hand, still not quite ready to forgive..

      And goes to tend to the crying BABY ELIZABETH..

      MARY is with her children, reading them a bedside story. From
      next door, the sound of raised voices. The KING and ANNE are
      having a furious row. But MARY is not listening..

                          ANNE (O.S.)
             You can't ignore me like this. I am your

      ANNE and MARY are together. ANNE is combing her hair. Strands of
      it come loose in her hands. Her eyes are hollow with stress. Her
      skin pale and covered in a film of perspiration..

                          ANNE
             I struck him today. What am I doing? I
             am destroying this all on my own..

      ANNE looks left and right. Makes sure no one is within earshot.
      Goes to check outside her door, then returns..

                          ANNE
             I can't sleep at night! And without

      ANNE eyes stare. She rocks back and forth..

                          ANNE
             It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it.

      MARY takes ANNE's hand. Envelops it in hers.


      INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      The sound of ugly, loveless sex. Cries of pain. ANNE tries to
      keep the KING aroused. Demeaning, cruel, shaming, loveless sex.
1     HENRY repeatedly strikes her. Hating her. Hating himself.


 51                                                            151
      INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - PALACE - NIGHT

      In the neighbouring room: the ugly sounds of ANNE and HENRY's
      sex come through the walls.

      MARY covers her ears with a pillow, blocking out the noise, and
      escapes to the only safe world she knows. That of her dreams.


152                                                            152
      INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

      SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, NORFOLK, GEORGE BOLEYN and MARY are watching
      intently as ANNE is being examined by several PHYSICIANS.

       nbearable tension. Finally a PHYSICIAN straightens, turns to
      face the FAMILY..

                          SIR THOMAS
             And..?

      The PHYSICIAN's face: he nods.

      A magnificent winter party to celebrate ANNE's pregnancy. The
      River Thames is frozen over. It's a lavish spectacle.

      Jousting on ice-skates, bear-baiting with dogs, MUSICIANS, skate-
      dancing, sledges and fire-eaters and Muscovite tumblers.

The KING threads his way through COURTIERS and ENTERTAINERS.
Wherever he goes, people stop their conversations, bow in fear.
Inimidated.

ANNE, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. Alone. She looks
drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN
KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.

                     EORGE
       And so, it's come to this. Our sister is
       with child, and all England's fate is in
       the balance.

 EORGE indicates ANNE..

                    GEORGE (cont'd)
       If it's a boy, the King will have been
       vindicated in getting rid of his first
       wife, and his authority will be
       unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if,
       God forbid, she miscarries.

 EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark,
malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.

                    GEORGE
       The King will have to move swiftly to
       silence his enemies. He will claim
       innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne
       will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by
       someone more `acceptable'.
              (a beat)
       And we Boleyns will never be able to
       show our faces at court again.

                    MARY
       That's no bad thing.

MARY shudders to herself. Holds her children protectively.

                    MARY
       Anyone with any sense would have run
       away from this hell-hole already. As far
       as they could go.

                    GEORGE
        ike the wise William Stafford.

MARY turns...

                    MARY
       What?

                    GEORGE
       You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left
       for the country. Just like that. Gone to
       live in some place called..

             ..Tatton.

                          GEORGE
             Where he grew up, apparently. Did you
             know he came from a better stable than
             all of us? His grandmother was a
             Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he
             never mentioned it.
                    (shrugs)
             Who'd have guessed?

       EORGE shrugs, and skates off with FRANCIS WESTON. We pull back
      to reveal they are being watched by JANE PARKER..

      ..who looks drained. Lonely. Worn out by the humiliation of her
      failed marriage and the agony of unrequited love.

      INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      `HAAARRGGH', ANNE bolts awake in the middle of the night. Her
      face is pale. She is covered in a thin film of perspiration. She
      flinches in pain. Holding her stomach..

      Immediately doors open, and several SERVANTS and LADIES appear.
      But ANNE composes herself.

                          ANNE
             I'm fine, thank you.
                    (visibly paranoid)
             Just a bad dream.

      Reassured, the SERVANTS fill ANNE's glass with water..

                          ANNE
                    (flinches as she speaks)
             But fetch my brother and sister, will
             you?

      The SERVANT bows, and goes. As soon as ANNE is left alone, she
      slowly looks down, and pulls back the bedsheets..
      W
       hen ANNE sees what lies beneath, she howls in horror.

      MARY and GEORGE arrive breathlessly in ANNE's room, to find..

      ANNE is on the floor before the fire, her arms wrapped around as
      if she were hugging herself. On the floor beside her is a
      bloodstained bundle of sheets.

      ANNE looks up through the trailing locks of her hair..

                    ANNE
       I lost it. Almost without pain. And so
       fast it was over in a moment.

MARY looks down at the bundle of sheets..

                    MARY
              (heart cracks)
       Oh, Anne..

MARY hugs ANNE tightly. All animosity now gone..

                    ANNE
        ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get
       rid of it somehow. No one must know.

 EORGE rushes to a cupboard, and pulls out a cape. He wraps it
around ANNE. Then he pours wine into a glass. MARY wraps ANNE in
a blanket to warm her. And begins making the bed with fresh
linen..

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

AN HOUR LATER: ANNE is composed. Staring into the fire. MARY and
GEORGE sit on either side of her.

                    ANNE
       It's not the first. Miscarriage.

MARY's heart cracks. Takes ANNE's hand.

                    ANNE
       They will take it as proof that I cannot
       bear children. That I am cursed by God.
       And should be dispensed with.

                    MARY
       Why? There's still time. You could sleep
       with the King, and fall pregnant again.
       No one would know..

                    ANNE
        he King would never lie with me now,
       and risk damaging the `child' he
       believes I'm carrying..
               a beat)
       Besides, he is barely capable anymore.
       And I couldn't go through that again.

ANNE stares at MARY and GEORGE..

                    ANNE
       No, if I am to survive..I have to take
       matters into my own hands.

MARY and GEORGE exchange blank looks..

       I need a baby, Mary.
               rolling eyes)
       Must I spell it out?

                    MARY
       You mean lying with another man?

                      ANNE
       Of course.

                    GEORGE
       But that would be treason.

                    MARY
        esides, where would you find someone
       you could trust?

                    ANNE
       Obviously, it would have to be someone
       close. Very close..

ANNE stares meaningfully at her BROTHER..

       No..!

       Stop it, Anne! It's madness..

                    ANNE
       Don't you see? This affects all of us.
       If I go down, so do all of you. The only
       way to save ourselves..is to do this..
              (a beat)
       And pray it's a boy.

MARY covers her mouth in horror, gets to her feet..

                    MARY
       I can't listen to this..
              (feeling nauseous)
       ...this is monstrous..

                    ANNE
       Mary, sit down..

                    MARY
       No, Anne! I understand you have had a
       shock tonight. A terrible shock. But
       there is no need for this..

      INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANNE'S ROOM - NIGHT

      MARY leaves the room. Tears stream down her cheeks. She runs
      down the corridor, rushing towards her children..

      But as MARY goes, we REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL:

      A figure sits in the shadows by ANNE's door. Someone who has
      heard everything that has been said..
      I
       t's JANE PARKER. Who turns, holding her head, covering her
      ears, unable to listen to any more..

      MARY rushes into her room. She goes to the beds where her
      CHILDREN are sleeping. MARY gently shakes them awake..

      ANNE and GEORGE stare at one another. ANNE pours a mug full of
      mulled wine..

      ANNE takes the first step, and starts unbuttoning her brother's
      shirt. GEORGE quickly knocks back the glass of mulled wine..

      MARY walks along a corridor. She looks in the bedroom.

      MEN's clothes in the wardrobe. No sign anywhere of a woman's
      presence. MARY turns, then catches sight of herself in a mirror.
      Her hair is bedraggled. Her clothes are filthy.

      MARY pours hot water into a bath. The room is thick with steam.
      She begins unbuttoning her dress.

      WILLIAM STAFFORD and several FARM-HANDS return from working in
      the fields. Talking and laughing. They reach a crossroads, go
      their separate ways. STAFFORD rides on for a while..

      ..then stops when he sees a horse outside his house.


      EXT. STAFFORD'S FARMHOUSE - DAY
 74                                                              174
      STAFFORD dismounts his horse. A quizzical look. Then he walks
      towards the front door.

      STAFFORD enters his house to see empty bowls of food on the
      table.

       HILDREN's boots by the door. And a WOMAN's riding cape.

       rom upstairs, the sound of splashing. STAFFORD expression
      changes. He slowly goes up the stairs.

       he sound of splashing gets louder. A WOMAN's voice. Humming.


      INT. BATHROOM - DAY

      STAFFORD pushes open the door. MARY is in the bath. Washing
      herself. MARY looks up.

      MARY's eyes.

                     a beat)
             I just didn't know where else to go.

      STAFFORD walks in. MARY gets up...

      No modesty. No shame. No effort to cover herself.

      STAFFORD sweeps her into his arms..

      No words. No explanations. Time for that later.

       hey fall into a passionate embrace, and sink to the floor..

      Time has passed. Winter has become spring. We're in an idyllic
      country church. MARY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are being married by a
      PRIEST.

                           RIEST
             Do you, Mary, take William as your

      A dance is in progress. MUSICIANS play. Fifty or so GUESTS.

      MARY is talking to a friend. In another corner: she notices a
      MESSENGER arrive. A former COLLEAGUE from court.

       e talks to STAFFORD. They talk gravely. STAFFORD's face is
      ashen..

      MARY excuses herself from her friend, crosses the room, goes to
      STAFFORD..           M
                           MARY

      ANNE is walking alone. Her MAIDS follow at a distance. Presently
      she lets out a cry. Her body doubles up in pain.

      Her MAIDS rush towards her.

      Back at the dance. STAFFORD continues..

                          STAFFORD
             They say it was deformed...monstrous.
             She is charged with incest and of
             summoning the devil. Your brother, too.
             He has already been sentenced. Anne is
             in the Tower, awaiting trial.

      ANNE in a prison cell at the Tower. Frightened. Vulnerable.

                             MARY
             I must go.

      MARY turns to walk out. STAFFORD blocks her path..

                          STAFFORD
             And do what? George is doomed. For Anne
             it's only a matter of time.

                          MARY
             I can petition the King..

                          STAFFORD
              ou think he will listen? It's his own
             neck he's saving by getting rid of them,
             can't you see?

      MARY stares..

                          STAFFORD
             Fine, go. But if you do, you might as
             well kiss your children goodbye. You are
             Anne's sister. That alone makes you her
             accomplice and co-conspirator.

                          MARY
             I have no choice. Anne and George are my
             family. I cannot desert them.

      MARY walks towards the door..

                          STAFFORD
             And what of your new family? Your
             CHILDREN?

                          MARY

      ANNE is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches,
      and filled with fifty or sixty of the country's most powerful
      NOBLEMEN. ANNE walks to the centre of the room, surveying her
      `jurors', noting that they have remained seated..

                          ANNE
             It is a sad day for England when the
             nobles do not rise for their Queen.

                          NORFOLK
             And even sadder when that same Queen is
             charged with adultery and incest.

                          ANNE
             Charged is different to convicted,
             Uncle. Or is it not? In this court?

      Deathly silence. The clearing of throats. Then with much chair
      scraping, the NOBLES reluctantly get to their feet..

                          NORFOLK
             Master Cromwell, read out the
             indictment..

      CROMWELL gets to his feet..

                          CROMWELL
             The charge is that in the twenty-eighth
             year of the reign of our Sovereign
             Henry, King of England, his wife, the
             Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did
             knowingly commit adultery, high treason
             and offences against God.

                          NORFOLK
             How do you plead?

                          ANNE
             Not guilty, my Lord.

      MARY thunders across bridges, through villages. Urging on her
      horse. No thought of rest.

                           A
      ANNE faces the LORDS, as she makes her case..

                          ANNE
             My noble Lords..the love I have for my
             brother is the love any sister would
             have for someone with whom she has grown
             up in the same house, nursed when sick,
             played games as children, shared life's
             celebrations.

      As ANNE delivers this speech, our CAMERA slowly pulls back,
      back, towards the door..

                          ANNE
             That is the love I have for him. Not
             what you suggest.

      Our CAMERA pulls out through the door...

      ..and into a corridor beyond, where we find HENRY hunched in
      shadows, eavesdropping, his face cast in shadows..

                          ANNE (V/O)
             Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But
             never forget that your verdicts will be
             judged again by God, in the greatest
             court of all..

      HENRY's face is a study of guilt. His knuckles whiten, his nails
      dig into his hands..

                          NORFOLK (V/O)
             My Lords, the time has come to cast your
             vote.

      ANNE watches on as each LORD takes it in turn to get to his
      feet, and deliver his verdict. First CROMWELL, then the
      SEYMOURS, then HENRY PERCY..

      The verdicts rain down on ANNE, `Guilty, guilty, guilty', going
      round the courtroom, until they reach the DUKE of NORFOLK. ANNE
      meets the eyes of her UNCLE..

                          NORFOLK
                    (unflinching)
             Guilty.

      NORFOLK stares at ANNE. Not a hint of compassion..

                          NORFOLK
             In which case, the burden falls on me to
             pass sentence.

      GEORGE BOLEYN's eyes are covered with a cloth. He puts his head
      on the block. A PRIEST says last rites as GEORGE's arms are held
      back. Terrified, his lips mouth prayers..begging forgiveness.

      The axe falls. A huge ROAR goes up.

      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this has been watched by SIR THOMAS
      BOLEYN.

      MARY arrives in time to hear the ROAR from the crowds. She
      dismounts her horse, exhausted from the journey,

       he walks against a tide of CROWDS leaving. Drunk. Laughing.
      Talking among themselves.

      MARY's expression changes.

      Suddenly, a shiver goes down her spine. MARY feels sick. Fearing
      the worst, she goes up to a WOMAN in the CROWDS..

      HENRY walks through corridors arm in arm with JANE SEYMOUR,
      followed closely by the SEYMOUR BROTHERS, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and
      the ever-surviving DUKE of NORFOLK..

      HENRY turns a corner, then stops in his tracks when he
      sees...MARY waiting outside his Privy Chamber, restrained by
      GUARDS. Seeing the King, she curtseys deeply..

                           HENRY
             Mary..?

      The SEYMOUR BROTHERS draw their swords, but the KING's DOG runs
      excitedly towards her. HENRY gestures for the SEYMOURS to sheath
      their swords..       H
                            ENRY
             Leave us.

      The SEYMOURS leave. The DUKE of NORFOLK hesitates..

                           HENRY
             ALL of you!

      NORFOLK shoots MARY a look, then goes. HENRY turns and leads her

      His private room. His sanctuary. Where he took her before. The
      room to which only MARY seems to have had access..

                          MARY
             Your Majesty..

                     as HENRY closes the door
                     ensuring their privacy)
             I understand my family has offended you.
             But having taken my brother today, I beg
             you to spare my sister.

                    HENRY
       She has been tried and found guilty.

                    MARY
       You could send her away.

                     ENRY
       I am bound by the law.

                    MARY
       You could send her to a nunnery. No one
       would know.

                    HENRY
       Anne? To a nunnery?

HENRY almost manages a smile.

                    MARY
       There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of
       France did it, too. When his wife could
       not conceive.

                    HENRY
       The French Queen was a blameless woman.
       Your sister a witch.

                    MARY
       I understand Anne has offended you. I
       ask only that if there is any regret you
       might..feel yourself.

                     ENRY
       What?

                    MARY
       For your part in the matter..

MARY treads delicately. Realising the very suggestion is
treason.

                    MARY
       ..does not unduly colour your thinking.
       Killing Anne will not make it go away.
              (a beat)
       It would only make it worse.

 ENRY stares at MARY..

                    HENRY
       How could I have made that mistake?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

      Suddenly his eyes are full of regret. And sadness.

                          HENRY (cont'd)
             Choosing her over you?

       ENRY thinks. A long silence.

                          HENRY
              o. I will reflect on the matter.

      MARY falls on one knee. Kisses his swollen, bejewelled hand in
      gratitude. HENRY stares, watching her as she goes.


      EXT. TOWER HILL - DAY

      A team of CARPENTERS erect gallows and scaffolding. Hammers
      knock nails. A sickening metronome of death.

      OTack', `tack', `tack'.
       n the hill: a blood-stained chopping block is put into place.


      INT. ANNE'S CELL - DAY
196                                                               196
      The doors to ANNE's cell open. ANNE looks up. In the doorway is
      MARY. MARY stares at ANNE..

      ANNE's appearance is shocking. She looks ten years older.
      Haggard and lined by stress.

      ANNE puts on a brave face, stares back at MARY.

                          MARY
             Oh, Anne..

      The two sisters walk towards one another, and embrace. Tight.
      Tears run onto each other's shoulders..

                          ANNE
             How has it come to this?

                          MARY
             Ssshhhhh.

      A LIEUTENANT gives a nod. SOLDIERS raise a barrier, and allow
      the CROWDS that have been waiting to rush forward.

       he CROWDS swarm over the grassy hill...putting down
      coats...reserving seats..anxious to secure the best views.

                                                             112.

      ANNE looks out through a narrow window. Her intense, fearful
      eyes flit and dart..

                          ANNE
             They're letting the crowds in.

                          MARY
             It's all right. You will be spared. The
             King as good as gave me his word.

                          ANNE
             The King saw you?

                             MARY
             Yes.

      ANNE manages a rueful smile..

                          ANNE
             We all made a mess of that, didn't we?
             We all underestimated little Mary.

      ANNE looks at MARY..

                          ANNE
             I don't think he ever stopped loving
             you.

                          MARY
             That's not true.

                          ANNE
             It is. He never loved me in the same
             way. And deep down you know it.

      MARY averts her eyes..

                          ANNE
             You should have been Queen. You even
             gave him a son. But instead all this has
             happened because..
                    (a beat)
             Because I couldn't bear to be the Other
             Boleyn Girl.

      ANNE shrugs..

                          ANNE
             And now look?

      The sound of approaching footsteps. ANNE looks at MARY, suddenly
      frightened..

                          ANNE
             Hold me..

      The two SISTERS fall into an emotional embrace as the JAILOR's
      keys turn in the lock..

                          ANNE
             You'll look after Elizabeth?

                          MARY
             It will be all right. Trust me.

                          ANNE
              he couldn't ask for a better moth...
                    (breaks down, composes
                     herself)

      MARY hugs ANNE tight..`Sssshhh'.

                          MARY
              e will spare you. I am sure of it.

      ANNE takes a deep breath. Tries to look serene..


      EXT. TOWER HILL - DAY
199                                                            199
      A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is
      violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across Tower Hill
      to the scaffold. She shoots MARY an anxious look across the
      crowds..
      M
      MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and
      faces the CROWDS. Finally the jeers subside..

                          ANNE
             I...I come here to die...a loyal
             subject..

      More spit, jeers and abuse. MARY stands on tiptoe, cranes her
      neck. Anxiously scans the CROWDS for the GUARDS that will free
      ANNE..

                          MARY
             Come on..

                          ANNE
             ..I..I do not blame the King. Never was
             there a more just or goodly Lord..

      Presently, MARY sees two SOLDIERS pushing through the CROWDS
      towards her. Her heart leaps..

                          ANNE
             ..I beg God's forgiveness and his
             mercy..

      ANNE looks up to see the SOLDIERS reaching MARY, and handing her
      a letter. ANNE smiles in relief. MARY opens the letter and
      reads..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             "Madam..."


      INT. CROMWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

      THOMAS CROMWELL, the former assistant to WOLSEY, who has now
      replaced him, sits at his desk, writing the letter..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             ..the King has spared you because of his
             respect and affection for you and
             because you are the mother of his son."

      MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by
      the EXECUTIONER..

                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
             "But you risked your life coming to
             court and you are advised you not to do
             so again. You will not be shown the same
             clemency a second time. Your sister Anne
             was tried and found guilty, her crimes
             were high treason and she deserves to
             die. Cromwell."

      MARY, who is reading, looks up in horror..

                          MARY
             No!

      ANNE looks up. She sees the look on MARY's face.

      MARY's eyes.

      ANNE's eyes.

      `WHOOSH', the masked EXECUTIONER swings his sword. ANNE is
      beheaded. MARY almost chokes..

      The CROWD falls eerily silent. A stunned calm descends on Tower
      Green. Nothing but the sound of the wind.

      MARY sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. She
      falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms..

      ..WILLIAM STAFFORD, who has followed her to London.

      Suddenly the CROWDS burst into life. A great, bloodthirsty ROAR
      echoes around Tower Green as ANNE's head is lifted aloft..

                                                         (CONTINUED)

      WILLIAM STAFFORD carries MARY in his arms. They walk against the
      flow, of teaming CROWDS, and newly-arriving FAMILIES coming to
      watch the spectacle..

     BLACK

     We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then...

     FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY

     The financial district.  Lots of people in suits.  A shaky,
     spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...

     JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a
     tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.  He
     starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and
     dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then...

     WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     As Foley goes inside, we then...

     CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS...

                        LOOKING FOR MONEY?

                  YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

     We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now...

     INSIDE THE BANK

     as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
     while he studies the bank layout.

     Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter
     the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
     area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes
     hands with the man and they both sit down.

     Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller
     window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
     with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA.

                              TELLER/LORETTA
                 How can I help you, sir?

                              FOLEY
                 Loretta, you see that guy talking to
                 your manager, has his case open?

     Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly,
     begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.

                              LORETTA
                 That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant
                 managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
                 but he's not in today.

                              FOLEY
                 But you see the guy with the attache
                 case?

                              LORETTA
                      (looks again)
                 Yes.

                              FOLEY
                 That's my partner.  He has a gun in
                 there.  And if you don't do exactly
                 what I tell you, or you give me any
                 kind of a problem, I'll look over at
                 my partner and he'll shoot your Mr.
                 Guindon between the eyes.

     Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Now take one of those big envelopes
                 and put as many hundreds, fifties and
                 twenties as you can pack into it.
                 Nothing with bank straps or rubber
                 bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I
                 don't want any bait money.  Start with
                 the second drawer and then the one
                 over there, under the computer.  Come
                 on, Loretta, the key's right there
                 next to you.  No bills off the bottom
                 of the drawer.
                      (as she works)
                 First time being robbed?
                      (she nods)
                 You're doing great.  Just smile,
                 Loretta, so you won't look like you're
                 being held up.
                      (she smiles awkwardly)
                 That's the way, you're doing fine.

     We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the
     front door.  When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having
     some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here, give me the twenties.  I'll put
                 'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had
                 to give my partner a sign; that's good.
                 Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds
                 till after I'm out the door, make sure
                 you haven't set off the alarm.  If you
                 have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon
                 between the eyes.  Okay?  I think
                 that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta,
                 and have a nice day.

                              LORETTA
                 You, too.

     Foley heads for the door.  He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk,
     looks back at Loretta.  Foley smiles at her, then turns to the
     Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta...

                              FOLEY
                 She's cute, isn't she?

     The man looks across the bank at Loretta.

                              MAN
                 Uh, yeah, I guess so.

     Foley winks at Loretta and walks out.

                              MAN (CONT'D)
                      (to Mr. Guindon)
                 Who was that?

     EXT. BANK - SAME

     As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Foley tries to start the car.  No go.  He tries again.

                              FOLEY
                 Come on...

     But the car won't start.  Foley bangs on the wheel...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Fuck!

     Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open
     window into Foley's ear...

                              COP
                 I think you flooded it.

     Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling,
     now has his gun pointing at him.

                              SECOND COP
                 Get out've the car, sir.

                              FOLEY
                 Wanna hear a funny story?

                              SECOND COP
                 Shut up and get out've the car.

     And as Foley obliges, we then...

     FADE TO WHITE.

     We hear a MAN GRUNT.  Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps
     through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as
     we realize he's on his way to the rim when...

     ...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     A BASKETBALL GAME in progress.  All of the men, Foley included,
     are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts.  The game is
     rough.  Hair is pulled.  Eyes are poked.  Faces punched.

     A title reads: "GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.  BELLE GLADE,
     FLORIDA."

     Foley is the oldest player here.  He's getting tired, starts to
     lose his breath.  He finally walks off the court, breathing so
     hard he can't even talk.  He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
     to come in and take his place.

     Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath.  He looks
     across the yard to where...

     A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES

     sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards.  All of
     them are over sixty.  One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches
     hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...

     INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:

     As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
     Mal and Lucky Strike packs.  Another tends to a tomato bush in
     a tiny patch of garden near the wall.  Another one sits nearby
     painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.

     Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
     his eye.  He watches as...

     TWO LATINO MEN

     both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop
     and begin stretching out.  One of them nods to Foley.  Foley
     nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks
     over to a guard, PUPKO ("PUP"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.

                              PUP
                 You want something, Foley?

     Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.

                              FOLEY
                 Some people are going out of here.
                 What if I told you where and when?

                              PUP
                 How many?

                              FOLEY
                 I expect you to look out for me, Pup,
                 let me run off work details.

                              PUP
                 Okay.  How many going out?

                              FOLEY
                 I hear six.

                              PUP
                 When?

                              FOLEY
                 Looks like tonight.

                              PUP
                 You know who they are?

                              FOLEY
                 I do, but I won't tell you just yet.
                 Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,
                 right before lock-down.

     INT. MESS HALL - LUNCH

     As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea
     of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
     at a table full of other little Latins.  CHINO -- fifties, in
     shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.

     Chino's "wife", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray
     of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
     with a bunch of bikers.

     Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
     off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too.

     EXT. MESS - DAY

     Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette.  He puts an arm
     around Lulu, starts to walk off...

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Today's the day, huh?

     Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip
     down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next
     thing to having him on a leash.

                              FOLEY
                 You excited?

                              CHINO
                 I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but I see you moved it up.

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 Why you think is today?

                              FOLEY
                 You were out running this morning,
                 sticking to your routine, anybody
                 happened to notice.  But you only did
                 a couple of miles instead of your usual
                 five.  Saving yourself for the main
                 event.  Then I see you inside eating
                 ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates
                 for endurance.

     Chino and Lulu exchange looks.

                              CHINO
                 You want, I tole you you can come.
                 You all right, Foley.  I like you.

                              FOLEY
                 You told me I can come 'cause I caught
                 you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you
                 and Lulu coming out of the bushes,
                 thought maybe you two were making out.

     Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 So what, you finish ahead of schedule?

     Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.

                              CHINO
                 You see what they doing, those posts
                 out there?  Putting up another fence,
                 five metres on the other side of the
                 one that's there.  We wait until Super
                 Bowl Sunday, they could have the second
                 fence built and we have to dig another
                 nine, ten days.  So we going soon as
                 it's dark.  You want -- I mean it --
                 you can still come.

                              FOLEY
                 I appreciate the offer.  And it's
                 tempting.

     Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence
     not twenty yards away.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 But, man, it's a long run to
                 civilization.  A hundred miles to Miami?
                 I'm too old to start acting crazy, try
                 a stunt like that.  You make it out,
                 send me a postcard.

     CUT TO: A NOTEPAD

     where we see someone has written "IT'S MAGIC!" then crossed out
     the "IT'S" and replaced it with the word "LIKE".  We hear THE
     PHONE RING AND...

     REVEAL: INT. ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Miami Beach Moderne.  ADELE -- mid-thirties, pretty, Foley's ex --
     sits at her kitchen table writing on a pad.  She grabs the phone.

                              ADELE
                 Hello?
                      (then, sighs)
                 Yeah, I accept.

     INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

     Foley on the phone...

                              FOLEY'S VOICE
                 Hey, Adele, how you doing?

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & ADELE:

                              ADELE
                 Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice?
                 Next time, leave the engine running.

                              FOLEY
                 That's funny, Adele.  How many more
                 times you gonna gimme that one?

                              ADELE
                 Till it's not funny any more.  What do
                 you want, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 You know that Super Bowl party?  They
                 changed the date.  It's on tonight,
                 eight-thirty.

                              ADELE
                 Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't
                 monitored?

                              FOLEY
                 I said not as a rule.

                              ADELE
                 So why don't you come right out and
                 tell me what you're talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there
                 in the free world.

                              ADELE
                 What's free about it?  I'm looking for
                 work.

                              FOLEY
                 What happened to Mandrake the Magician?

                              ADELE
                 Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired
                 me and hired another girl, a redhead.
                 I'm working on a new business card,
                 pass out to the cafes.  How's this
                 sound--

                              FOLEY
                      (cuts her off)
                 Listen, Adele, the reason I called,
                 that party is today instead of Sunday.
                 About eight-thirty, like only a few
                 hours from now.  So you'll have to get
                 hold of Buddy, whatever he might be
                 doing...

                              ADELE
                 And the one driving the other car?

                              FOLEY
                 What're you talking about?

                              ADELE
                 Well, seeing as you have so much luck
                 with cars, Buddy thought it might be
                 better to bring two.  He got this guy
                 he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn
                 something.

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn Michaels.

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn
                 thinks you guys are real cool.

                              FOLEY
                 He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see
                 Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step
                 on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off
                 first.

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     As MARSHALL SISCO -- fifty -- slides a small wrapped box across
     a table...

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday.

     ...to where KAREN SISCO -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair,
     a knockout -- sits.  She picks up the box and shakes it.

                              KAREN
                 You fit another Chanel suit in here?

                              MARSHALL
                 Something better.  Open it.

     Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present.  Marshall watches,
     takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how
     everyone's looking at the two of them...

                              KAREN
                      (opens the box)
                 Oh my God...

     She pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It's beautiful.

                              MARSHALL
                 It's a --

                              KAREN
                 --Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.

     She leans across the table and kisses him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Thanks, Dad.

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday, kid.
                      (then)
                 You want another Coke?

                              KAREN
                      (checks her watch)
                 Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades,
                 then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.

                              MARSHALL
                 Which one is that?  The ATF guy?

                              KAREN
                 He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now,
                 he switched over.

                              MARSHALL
                 He's still married though, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Technically.  They're separated.

                              MARSHALL
                 Oh, he's moved out?

                              KAREN
                 He's about to.

                              MARSHALL
                 Then they're not separated, are they?

                              KAREN
                 Can we change the subject?

                              MARSHALL
                 What're you doing at Glades?

                              KAREN
                 Serving process, a Summons and
                 Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory
                 life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.
                 He files suit, says he has no choice
                 in what they serve and it violates his
                 civil rights.

                              MARSHALL
                 You know you can always step in, work
                 with me full-time as one of my
                 investigators.

                              KAREN
                 No thanks.

                              MARSHALL
                 You used to like it.

                              KAREN
                 Dad...

                              MARSHALL
                 You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing
                 wrong with them necessarily if they're
                 divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy
                 cop who drinks too much and cheats on
                 his wife?  That's the way those hotshots
                 are, all of 'em.

                              KAREN
                 I really gotta go.

                              MARSHALL
                 We don't get to talk much any more.

                              KAREN
                 How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch
                 the Super Bowl with you?

                              MARSHALL
                 I'd like that.

     She gets up, kisses him again.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks for the gun, Dad.

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY

     Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk.  He looks about the
     cell.  All he's got to show for himself.  It's now quiet on
     the cellblock.  Foley closes his eyes and we...

     CUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM

     A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE
     "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing
     trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.

     Title reads: LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.  LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA.
     And then... TWO YEARS AGO.

     AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM

     Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black,
     Foley's age, shaved head.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner, as
     does Maurice.  GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look, dark shades --
     counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the
     fighter's ear.

                              BUDDY
                 Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's
                 gonna send this guy out in a body bag.

     Foley watches a MAN -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking
     as those around him.  The guy looks nervous, can feel the other
     cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet.
     Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling.  Foley turns
     and watches the fight now...

                              FOLEY
                 Anyone ever tell you why they call him
                 Snoopy?

     Buddy shakes his head.  Maurice dances around the other guy
     now.  Teases him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back
                 when he was pro.  Now you pet him, he
                 goes down.

     The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely
     glances off Maurice's jaw.  Sure enough, Maurice makes a big
     show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally
     goes down.

                              BUDDY
                 I don't believe it.

     Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him
     and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as
     nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's
     pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons.  He throws
     a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning
     technique...

                              BUDDY
                 Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight.
                 Fuckin' pathetic.

     Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now
     stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one
     hand thrust into his pocket.  Foley watches as Maurice stops
     the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the
     fights -- as he comes out into the yard.

                              FOLEY
                 It's Richard Ripley.

                              BUDDY
                      (looking now)
                 The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I
                 didn't recognize him without his rug.

     Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy
     nodding, acquiescent, respectful.

                              FOLEY
                 Dick the Ripper they called him, on
                 account of all the people he ripped
                 off.

     Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he doin' here?

                              GLENN (OS)
                 Three years.

     They look to where Glenn Michaels, the blond guy in dark shades
     we saw in Maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few
     feet away.  He's shirtless, tan, in shape.

                              GLENN
                 He got three years and fined fifty
                 million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking
                 check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed
                 his name.
                      (struggles with the
                       bar)
                 Whoa-- little help here!

                              FOLEY
                 Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or
                 Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those
                 shades on.

                              GLENN
                 You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!

                              FOLEY
                 I guess the bright glare out here made
                 it hard to see the numbers on the
                 weights.

                              GLENN
                 I'll take the shades off.  Just get
                 this fuckin' thing off me.

     Foley helps him get the bar up.  Glenn sits up.

                              BUDDY
                 How do you know he wrote a check?

                              GLENN
                 He told me.  He works the laundry with
                 me.  The guy loves to talk.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney.  I hear he
                 rolled over on all the snitches he was
                 doing business with and got 'em all
                 brought up.

     He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley, one eye always on the
     swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, anybody that can write a check
                 for fifty mil, he says anything I'm
                 all fucking ears.  Like the other day,
                 he tells me how he's got all this money
                 in foreign banks, plus around five mil
                 in uncut diamonds at his house.  He
                 said, quote, "Where I can put my hands
                 on it anytime."

                              BUDDY
                 Cool.  Where's the guy live?

     Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley.
     Again, Ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making
     notations...

                              GLENN
                 Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut
                 diamonds are as easy to move as cash.

                              FOLEY
                 Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              GLENN
                 So.  What's your point?

                              FOLEY
                 My point is, that's probably what you're
                 gonna end up with.

                              GLENN
                 You think he's lying?

                              FOLEY
                 Use your head.  The guys got five
                 million lying around his house, you
                 really think he's gonna tell some
                 motormouth he just met in prison about
                 it?

     A BELL SOUNDS.  Everyone starts walking for the gate.

     Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate,
     Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket.

     SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who
     moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him... his
     left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like
     congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket
     and we see the long metal shiv--

                              BUDDY
                      (watching Snoopy)
                 Here it comes.

     Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs
     him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away.  The Boxer
     stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last
     jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose,
                 even if it's on purpose.

     We hear a WHISTLE BLOW as a GUARD spots the body.  And now
     everyone moves like hell for the gate... except for...

     Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the
     body.

     Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes
     Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks
     to him as they walk into the block...

                              FOLEY
                 You don't wanna be standing there, the
                 hacks start asking questions you don't
                 wanna answer.

                              RIPLEY
                 Oh, uh, right, thanks...

     Foley then moves away.  He sees Maurice looking back at him,
     giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW)

     He lies there another moment when...

     A PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk.
     Foley's CELLMATE jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the
     toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the
     bathroom.  Foley shakes his head and turns away...

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling
     a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door,
     when he sees...

     A WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come
     out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries.

     Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman
     is opening her trunk before coming forward...

                              BUDDY
                 Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.

     She doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the
     groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock.

                              WOMAN
                 I didn't ask for your help, so don't
                 expect a tip.

     Buddy smiles, waves her off.

                              BUDDY
                 That's okay, ma'am.  I'll just take
                 your car.

     She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     In the midst of a remodel.  As door opens and Pup comes in.
     Foley puts a finger to his lips...

                              FOLEY
                 They're right underneath you, Pup.
                 They dug a tunnel.

     Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the
     chapel, eyes on the floor, listening...

                              PUP
                 I don't hear 'em.  Where's the tunnel
                 come out?

     Pup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of
     the pews to a window.

                              FOLEY
                 Second fence post from the tower out
                 there.  Go on, take a look.

     As Pup stares out the window...

                              PUP
                 I don't see nothing there.

     Foley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT
     CRUCIFIX.  He picks it up, starts up the aisle...

                              FOLEY
                 You will directly.  Keep watching.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - DUSK

     As the high beams from her car show the prison parking area,
     then the fence strung with razor wire.  Karen parks near the
     fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone.

                              KAREN
                 Hi.  Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.
                      (beat)
                 He's not?  Could you tell him that...
                 never mind.  I'll call back.

     Headlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind
     her.  The lights go off, then come on again.  She adjusts the
     mirror to deflect the glare.

     INT. THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK

     As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field.
     He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen
     checks her face out in the rear-view.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     As Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor,
     holds the crucifix down against his leg.

                              PUP
                 There some car headlights out there...
                      (then)
                 Jesus Christ...

     Now he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it...

                              PUP (CONT'D)
                 Man outside the fence!  By tower six!
                      (responds to radio)
                 This is Officer Pupko...
                      (then)
                 I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake!

     Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it
     smack against the side of Pup's head.  Drops him clean with one
     swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a
     sound coming from him.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT

     As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car
     door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there,
     crouching down.

     Karen turns on her headlights.  No, not crouched.  The guy is
     coming out of the ground.  On this side of the fence.

     Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the
     ground.  Right in front of her.

     Karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by
     the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised
     there for a moment before taking off into the dark.  Karen gets
     out of the car...

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow
     the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before
     the men disappear into the dark.

     Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he
     gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her
     trunk...

                              BUDDY
                 What's she doing?

     He watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a
     holstered pistol.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     But then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there
     again and comes out this time racking a shotgun.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     And now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and
     raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND.
     Buddy gets out of the car...

     EXT. PARKING AREA - SAME

     As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty,
     standing by the hole they just crawled out of.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands in the air!

     Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds,
     start edging away -- shit, they've come this far.

     They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark,
     then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate,
     to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it
     for the cons.  They take off running...

     Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't
     fire...

     The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it,
     open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are
     cut down as they run.

     The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more
     interested in the hole the convicts had come out of.  Now they're
     standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons
     ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other
     as...

     A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying
     something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited,
     pointing towards the orange grove.

     They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to
     see if they're alive, then keep going.

     The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out.  He takes his time,
     puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an
     honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes.

     Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the
     shotgun on Buddy.  Buddy raises the palm of his hand.

                              BUDDY
                 It's okay, honey, we're good guys.

                              KAREN
                 What're you doing here?

     Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when
     they're already pretty sure what you're doing.  She glances
     around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature
     out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck.

     She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the
     shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip.

     They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still
     up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence,
     past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange
     grove.  A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet that's all the hacks they send
                 out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind
                 the store.

                              BUDDY
                 Why don't we talk about it later?

     He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the
     headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you're just a girl.  What do you
                 do for a living you pack a shotgun?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest, both of you guys.

     Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious
     thought, but what he says is...

                              FOLEY
                 I bet I smell, don't I?
                      (then)
                 Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll
                 get out of here.

     Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk.  She's
     reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when...

     Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against
     the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're
     cuddled up in bed.

     He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the
     gun in his face.  Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then
     everything goes...

     BLACK

     Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing.
     Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You comfy?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 If I could have a little more room.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 There isn't any.  All this shit you
                 got in here.  What is all this stuff
                 anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's
                 this can?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 For your breath.  You could use it.
                 Squirt some in your mouth.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've
                 you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor
                 unfortunate offenders.

     A BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it
     on.  He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he
     looks at all of her now and finally says...

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 Where's your gun, your pistol?

                              KAREN
                 In my bag, in the car.

     They go over some bumps.  We hear men's voices from somewhere
     far off, outside.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know you don't have a chance of
                 making it.  Guards are out here already,
                 they'll stop the car.

     He runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also,
     just, well, looking.

                              FOLEY
                 They're off in the cane by now chasing
                 Cubans.  I timed it to slip between
                 the cracks, you might say.

     EXT. CAR - NIGHT

     mirror...

     As Jack tries to wipe some of the mud off his face.

                              FOLEY
                 Boy, it stunk in there.

                              KAREN
                 I believe it.  You've ruined a nine-
                 hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, went real nice with that twelve
                 gauge, too.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, why in the world would someone
                 like you ever become a federal marshall?

                              KAREN
                 The idea of going after guys like you
                 appealed to me.

                              FOLEY
                 Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even
                 though I've been celibate lately, I'm
                 not gonna force myself on you.  I've
                 never done that in my life.

                              KAREN
                 You wouldn't have time anyway.  We
                 come to a roadblock, they'll run the
                 car, find out in five seconds who it
                 belongs to.

                              FOLEY
                 If they get set up in time, which I
                 doubt.  And even if they do they'll be
                 looking for a buncha little Latin
                 fellas, not a big black guy driving a
                 Ford.

                              KAREN
                 Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass
                 like this.

     More bumps.  Then picking up speed as the road smooths out.

                              FOLEY
                 Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy.
                 Back when we jailed together, he'd
                 call his sister every week without
                 fail.  She's a born-again Christian,
                 does bookkeeping for a televangelist.
                 Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins,
                 tells her about whatever bank he
                 happened to rob.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy.  That's his given name?

                              FOLEY
                      (woops, beat)
                 One I gave him, yeah.

     from her badge and ID case at the road.

     INT. TRUNK - SAME

                              KAREN
                 So, what's your name?  It'll be in the
                 paper tomorrow anyway.

                              FOLEY
                 Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of
                 me.

                              KAREN
                 Why, are you famous?

                              FOLEY
                 Time I was convicted in California?
                 FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than
                 anyone in the computer.

                              KAREN
                 How many was that?

                              FOLEY
                 Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I
                 started when I was eighteen, driving
                 for my Uncle Cully and his partner,
                 Gus.  They go into a bank this one
                 time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter
                 to get the tellers and breaks his leg.
                 All three of us ended up in Angola.

                              KAREN
                 That's funny.

                              FOLEY
                 I thought so, too.

                              KAREN
                 It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on
                 the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 I believe you would have.  Another fall,
                 I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I
                 don't mean the place next door where
                 some of Nixon's people went.

                              KAREN
                 I know the difference.  You were in
                 Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary.
                 I've delivered people there.  So
                 basically you've spent half your life
                 in prison.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I
                 do a full thirty years, no time off.
                 Can you imagine looking at that?

                              KAREN
                 I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.

     He looks at her, then looks away as we...

                 You don't seem all that scared.

                              KAREN
                 Of course I am.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't act like it.

                              KAREN
                 What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I
                 don't think it would help much.
                      (then)
                 I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy,
                 and wait for you to screw up.

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.

                              KAREN
                 You were married?  All those falls,
                 I'm surprised you had time.

                              FOLEY
                 It was just a year, give or take a few
                 days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't
                 get along or anything.  We had fun, we
                 just didn't have that... that thing,
                 you know?  That spark, you know what I
                 mean?  You gotta have that.

                              KAREN
                      (thinking)
                 Uh-huh.

                              FOLEY
                 We still talk, though.

                 these things never do.

                 Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot
                 like a dog, it'll be in the street,
                 not off a goddamn fence.

                              KAREN
                 You must see yourself as some kind of
                 Clyde Barrow.

     And for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on

                 Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm.
                 You ever see pictures of him, the way
                 he wore his hat?  You could tell he
                 had that don't-give-a-shit air about
                 him.

                              KAREN
                 I don't recall his hat, but I've seen
                 pictures of him lying dead, shot by
                 Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't
                 have his shoes on?

                              FOLEY
                 Is that right?

                              KAREN
                 They put a hundred and eighty-seven
                 bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker
                 and the car they were driving.  Bonnie
                 was eating a sandwich.

                              FOLEY
                 You're full of interesting facts, aren't
                 you?

                              KAREN
                 It was May, 1934, near Gibsland,

                              KAREN

                 Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get
                 shot?  I remember thinking at the time
                 it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you
                 have to.

                 and got to talking, say you were in a

                 what would happen.

                 I mean if you didn't know who I was.

                              KAREN

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah...

     They lie there a moment, think about that as we hear THE CAR
     SLOWING DOWN, coasting, then bumping along the shoulder of the
     road to a stop.

                              KAREN
                 I never thought it made sense, though,
                 the way they got together so quick.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.

                              KAREN
                 I mean, romantically.

                              FOLEY
                 Uh-huh.
                      (then)
                 Well, but if --

     The trunk goes dark again as the car's turned off.

                              BUDDY (OS)
                 You still alive in there?

     And the trunk lid raises so that we see Karen and Foley lying
     in the back.  Foley gets out.  Karen doesn't move.

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Where in the hell are we?

                              BUDDY
                 That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's
                 waiting with the other car.

                              FOLEY
                 Okay, honey, come on out of there.

     Karen pushes off, rolls from her right side to her left, brings
     up her Sig Sauer in both hands to put it on them, both standing
     in the opening, in the dark, but right there.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands up and turn around.
                 Now.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite
     directions as she begins firing from the inside...

     As Buddy and Foley hook up again in front of the car.  We can
     see they're beneath an overpass.  Foley stares at the trunk.

                              BUDDY
                 We may as well leave her, we're leaving
                 the car and we gotta leave her some place
                 anyway, what's the difference where?

                              FOLEY
                 She's coming with us.

     Foley walks to the passenger seat, reaches in the window.

                              BUDDY
                 Jesus Christ, what were you doing in
                 there?

                              FOLEY
                 Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd
                 like to know who she is.

     Foley takes her wallet, looks at her driver's licence photo.

                              BUDDY
                 I already looked.  Her name is Karen
                 Sisco.  Like the Cisco Kid only spelled
                 different, S-i-s-c-o.

     A sheriff's green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep
     to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment
     of the overpass.  When the road quiets down, Foley moves to the
     trunk and bangs on it once with his fist.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen?  Be a good girl now, you hear?
                 Now, I'm gonna open the--

     Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're putting holes in your car!

     He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him.
     He settles down, then...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 We're not leaving you.  I'm gonna open
                 the trunk enough for you to throw the
                 gun out.  Okay?  You shoot -- Buddy's
                 got your shotgun, says he'll shoot
                 back if you do and I can't stop him.
                 So it's up to you.

     Foley puts his hand out and Buddy, still looking at him funny,
     gives him the keys.

                              VOICE
                 Hey!

     Coming from somewhere above them.

                              VOICE (CONT'D)
                 It's me, Glenn.

     Foley steps out into the open, Buddy close behind him.  They
     look up to see a figure, head and shoulders against the evening
     sky, leaning on the concrete overpass rail.  We can see his
     long blond hair falling beside his face, now half-concealed
     behind dark sunglasses.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, Jack, good to see you, man.  The
                 fuck're you guys shooting at?

     Foley looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 Do we need him?

                              BUDDY
                 The green-and-whites saw us.  One of
                 'em starts thinking, what's that car
                 doing there?  Ties it to the break and
                 turns around...

     Foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were
                 somebody else.

                              GLENN
                 Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since
                 Lompoc.  What's going on?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, nuthin'.

     Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs
     on the trunk.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You coming out?

     Foley sticks the key in the lock as Buddy steps up to the trunk
     and racks the pump on the shotgun.  Foley leans close to the
     metal.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You hear that?

     He turns the key and raises the lid.  Karen, bunched in there,
     extends her arm, her hand holding the Sig Sauer by the barrel.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     "Jack."  Buddy gives him another funny look.

     EXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT

     As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen
     Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS."

                              FOLEY
                 Have your clothes cleaned and send me
                 the bill.

     Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade,
     move through the scrub.  Glenn leans against the car, flashers
     blinking.

                              KAREN
                 I'll send it to you at Glades.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a
                 sewer?

                              FOLEY
                 Take your sunglasses off.

                              GLENN
                 I see better with them on.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw
                 'em off the overpass while they're
                 still on your head.

     Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Wait in the car.

                              GLENN
                 You're in civilization now, man, ease
                 up.

                              FOLEY
                 I'd like you to go wait in the car.
                 How's that?  Take her with you and put
                 her in back.

                              GLENN
                 In the trunk?

                              FOLEY
                 The backseat.

     Foley stares at him, waiting.  Glenn motions to Karen...

                              GLENN
                 Come on.  I have to do what I'm told.

     She walks past Foley without looking at him.

                              FOLEY
                 Wait a minute.  Let me have your
                 raincoat.
                      (looks at Buddy)
                 Somebody forgot to bring me clean
                 clothes.

                              BUDDY
                 I brought 'em, they're back at Glades
                 in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take
                 her car.

                              KAREN
                 You can blame me if you want.  I don't
                 mind.

     He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds
     it up, then throws it at Foley's feet.

                              GLENN
                 Here you are, sir.

     Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back
     on and takes Karen by the arm.

                              BUDDY
                 What's wrong with you?

     Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the
     backseat.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll
                 never know.

                              BUDDY
                 How 'bout the score was his idea to
                 begin with?

                              FOLEY
                 His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's
                 got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you
                 and me figured the whole thing out.

     Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform,
     all of them caked with muck.

                              BUDDY
                 You're pulling at it.  Here...

     He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard
     shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and
     tearing the shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know why, but every time he
                 opens his mouth I want to punch him
                 out.

                              BUDDY
                 He ain't the problem, Jack.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You wanna pull your head outta your
                 ass and tell me why we're bringing her
                 with us?

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome
     light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door.
     He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs
     his hand through his hair...

                              GLENN
                 ...if he thinks he can talk to me like
                 this.  Shit, I don't even know what I
                 need them for.

     Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against
     the dark foliage.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 I got a big score lined up up north.
                 They wouldn't even know about it, it
                 wasn't for me.  I could do it right
                 now myself, except it's so fucking
                 cold up there in January--

                              KAREN
                 Glenn?

     His head turns so that we can see his designer shades.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You don't remember me, do you?

                              GLENN
                      (beat)
                 It couldn't have been out at Glades,
                 if that's what you're thinking.  I was
                 never out there.

                              KAREN
                 No, that's not what I'm thinking.

     He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face.

                              GLENN
                 But you're sure we've met, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Last fall, I drove you from the Palm
                 Beach county jail to the federal
                 courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn
                 Michaels.
                      (then)
                 I never forget anyone I've cuffed and
                 shackled.

     He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's
     been turned to stone.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if
                 we can work this out...

     He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Do we have a gun in the car?

                              GLENN
                 I remember you now.  Shit.

                              KAREN
                 Foley's not going to make it.  And if
                 he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.

     She touches his shoulder and he jumps.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Look, I can understand if you and Foley
                 are close.

                              GLENN
                 We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--

                              KAREN
                 Wait.  Have you helped him, Glenn?  At
                 this point, technically, I doubt you
                 could be charged with aiding a fugitive.
                 So you still have a choice.  You can
                 help him and risk going down again,
                 get cuffed and shackled, hope to God
                 you pull a reasonable judge, not some
                 hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it
                 another way...

     She pauses.  He turns and looks at her.

                              GLENN
                 Like how?

     EXT. OVERPASS - SAME

     Foley watches a car pass on the highway.

                              BUDDY
                 You want to take her to my place and
                 get cleaned up?  You come out of the
                 bathroom with your after-shave on and
                 she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?

                              FOLEY
                 I want to talk to her again, that's
                 all.  See what would happen under, you
                 know, normal circumstances.

                              BUDDY
                 You're too late, Jack.

     Foley doesn't say anything.  Just takes a deep breath as we
     HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over...

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 He wants to get out of here and I don't
                 blame him.

     They start towards the car.  Then stop and watch as it takes
     off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement.  Their backs
     to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're
     out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word.

     We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER...

     CUT TO: A CORRIDOR IN LOMPOC FPC

     As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named HIMEY
     -- strut purposefully up the hall.  They step into...

     THE PRISON LIBRARY

     Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big
     coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH."

                              MAURICE
                 Dick.  My man.

     Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the
     library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I got your fishies for you.

     He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the
     table.

                              RIPLEY
                      (reaches for them)
                 Thank you...

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls them back)
                 Not so fast, Dick.
                      (off Ripley's look)
                 Starting now, there's gonna be an across
                 the board cost a living increase.

                              RIPLEY
                 What?

                              MAURICE
                 Year ago, I come in here on credit
                 card fraud, but after I shanked that
                 loudmouth pussy on the yard the other
                 day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone
                 way the fuck up.

                              RIPLEY
                 I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.  But
                 then, I could be wrong...

                              MAURICE
                 Whoever.  The point is, prices are
                 goin' up, too.  Better get your little
                 black book out, Richard.  We got some
                 business to talk about.

     Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Let's start with the fish.  They was
                 two grand, but now they's three.

     Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you
                 asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

                              RIPLEY
                      (writing)
                 Well, I need that...

                              MAURICE
                 ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an
                 even three c's.

                              VOICE
                 Hey.

     They all look to where...

     JACK FOLEY

     Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of
     some kind.  Himey gives him a mean stare.  Foley points to a
     sign that says "QUIET PLEASE."

                              FOLEY
                 Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't
                 you guys read?

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 There a problem, Foley?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah.

     Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the
                 dumbest fucking shakedown in the history
                 of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred
                 bucks for a pillow?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              RIPLEY
                 Sounds high, doesn't it?

                              FOLEY
                 Must be a real soft pillow.

                              MAURICE
                 Faux goose down.

                              RIPLEY
                 Still...

                              FOLEY
                 How much for your company at chow?

                              MAURICE
                 Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet.  How much?

                              MAURICE
                 Another C.

     Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this
                 guy to fuck off.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?  Well, I uhhh...

                              FOLEY
                 First of all, if he kills you, he's
                 not gonna get any more money out of
                 you.

     Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point.

                              MAURICE
                 Man doesn't have to get killed.  He
                 could accidentally fall on something
                 sharp, like a shiv.  Or my dick.

     Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.

                              FOLEY
                 You stick anything in this guy, Snoop,
                 they transfer his ass outta here
                 faster'n you can throw a fight, and
                 you still end up with nothing.

     Ripley nods, takes this in.

                              MAURICE
                 This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why
                 don't you go on out to the yard, have
                 yourself a smoke?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't smoke.

                              HIMEY
                      (slowly rising)
                 You heard the man.  Go on outta here.

     Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.

                              MAURICE
                 Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
                 He's ranked number thirty-two in the
                 federal prison system.

                              FOLEY
                      (looking at Himey)
                 Thirty-two outta what, twenty?

     Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock
     Foley in the head when...

     ...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand,
     like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual
     into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending
     his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor
     back-first with a loud thud.

     Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A
     WHISTLE.  They all freeze, look to...

     A PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE

     Who nods towards the door.  We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS,
     takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up,
     covers his now bleeding nose.

                              GUARD
                 What's going on here?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, you know, reading's funnamental
                 an' shit, we just excited.

                              GUARD
                 Clear outta here.

     The guard exits.  Maurice and Foley are still staring at each
     other.

                              RIPLEY
                 Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the
                 fish thing?

                              MAURICE
                      (looks at Foley)
                 Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

     He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into
     Ripley's open hand.  Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a
     fist, crushing the fish.  He taps his fist to Ripley's.

                              RIPLEY
                 That's how you do it.

     Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with
     Himey.  Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at
     Foley.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thanks for your help.

                              FOLEY
                 Any time.

     We hear a PHONE RING and then...

     CUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW)

     As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, fool.  Stick and jab.

     A frisbee whizzes past the television.  We hear A DOG YELP OS.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Hey!  Watch that shit!

     Maurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a
     green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE
     RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                      (calls OS)
                 Tuffy.  C'mere, boy...

                              MAURICE
                 You gonna answer the phone?

                              MOSELLE
                 What for?  It's not for me.

     Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a
     little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's
     head.

                              MOSELLE (CONT'D)
                 Bad dog.

                              MAURICE
                      (scoops up the dog)
                 Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my
                 little Tuffy?

     He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child.

                              MOSELLE
                 I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a
                 Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra
                 money.

     He looks at her.

                              MAURICE
                 That's the dumbest thing I heard in my
                 life.  Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't
                 pay for shit.  You gonna get a gig,
                 it's gotta be for one of the big three:
                 Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit
                 for the fat dogs.  Now answer the fuckin
                 phone.

     She comes over, picks up the phone.

                              MOSELLE
                 Hello?
                      (hands it to Maurice)
                 For you.

                              MAURICE
                      (takes it)
                 This is me.

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - GAS STATION - NIGHT

     An antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone.

                              GLENN
                 Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.

     INTERCUTTING GLENN & MAURICE:

                              MAURICE
                 Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a
                 them psychic friends.  I was just
                 thinkin' about you.

     Glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln
     Town Car and jogs to the john.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to
                 Detroit and need a place to crash.

                              MAURICE
                 You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin
                 one degree outside.

                              GLENN
                 I wanna talk to you about a job.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.

                              GLENN
                 I can't really go into it right now.
                 I'll just tell you it's someone big.

                              MAURICE
                 Someone?  Gimme a hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's a guy you know.

                              MAURICE
                 Gimme another hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's Richard Ripley.

     Maurice doesn't say a word.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 You there?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here.
                 Question is, why aren't you here?

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy hurry up the front steps.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

                              BUDDY
                 Cause she had her hand on her gun the
                 whole time, waiting to make her move.

     Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're just jealous it was me in the
                 trunk with her and not you.

                              BUDDY
                 You're right.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A "hideout."  Not much in the way of furnishings.  Foley follows
     Buddy inside, watches as he bolts the door.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing I'm gonna do is get all
                 this mud off me.

     Foley starts for the bathroom.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I've been dreaming about a hot bath
                 for the last six months.  Soak the prison
                 off me.

                              BUDDY
                 There's some lilac oil, you want some,
                 a vanilla candle under the sink.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, man.

                              BUDDY
                 There's something about a nice hot
                 bath, transforms a person.  It's not
                 just about opening up your pores, know
                 what I mean?  There's just something
                 about the heat and the wet that's
                 calming you know?  Settles me in a way
                 that I really can't articulate.

                              FOLEY
                 I know exactly what you mean.  It's
                 just a feeling.
                      (beat)
                 You know, I could go for some wine
                 tonight.

                              BUDDY
                 There's a store around the corner,
                 I'll be right back.

                              FOLEY
                 Sounds great.

     Foley goes into the bathroom.  A moment later WE HEAR THE BATH
     RUNNING.

     INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

     As Buddy leaves the apartment, starts down the hall, KAREN STEPS
     INTO FRAME, watches as he disappears down the stairs.  Gun drawn,
     she then moves towards the apartment.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     As Foley undresses, picks up a candle off the sink and smells
     it.  He notices his nude image in the mirror and checks himself
     out.

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     As Karen slips the door.  She looks around, HEARS THE WATER
     RUNNING.

     She racks the slide on her gun, snicks off the safety and starts
     for the bathroom.  Suddenly, the water is turned off.  She stops
     where she is.  She then moves a careful step at a time towards
     the open doorway.

     Gradually the tub comes into view, beginning with Foley's feet
     resting crossed on the other end, then the middle of the tub,
     then she's in the doorway, looking down at...

     Foley, lying there in the tub, his eyes closed.  Karen cuts her
     eyes down the length of him, taking a moment here to check him
     out, long enough for Foley to open his eyes and grab her hand,
     the one holding the gun.

                              FOLEY
                 Hey.

     They look at each other a moment.  He then pulls her down to
     him and kisses her.  She kisses him back.  He then pulls her
     into the tub with him as we now hear...

                              MARSHALL SISCO (VO)
                 Karen...?

     CUT TO: KAREN

     As she opens her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 What?

     REVEAL: A HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Flowers everywhere.  Karen -- bruises on her face -- lies in
     bed.  Her father, Marshall, sits on the chair beside her.

                              MARSHALL
                 You were talking in your sleep.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 What'd I say?

                              MARSHALL
                 "Hey, yourself."

                              KAREN
                 Huh.

     We hear A KNOCK at the door.  They look to where Special Agent
     DANIEL BURDON -- black, forties, expensive suit -- stands in
     the doorway, file in one hand.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hello, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                      (to Marshall)
                 Daniel Burdon, FBI.

                              MARSHALL
                 Marshall Sisco.  Karen's dad.

                              BURDON
                 You mind please waiting outside.  We
                 have some business to do here.

     Marshall looks at him a moment.  Then, to Karen...

                              MARSHALL
                 I need to go to the john anyway.

     Burdon waits for Marshall to walk out, then sits down.

                              KAREN
                 I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                 That's nice of you to offer, Karen,
                 but I got all the help I can use right
                 now.  Instead, let's talk about how
                 you got the bump on your head.

                              KAREN
                      (indicates file)
                 Isn't that my report you're holding
                 onto?

                              BURDON
                 Yes, but I want to hear you tell it.
                 Starting with when you tried to grab
                 the wheel -- where was this?

                              KAREN
                 Coming to the Okeechobee exit...

     And now we see it...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars...

                              KAREN
                 Take the next exit.

                              GLENN
                 What am I supposed to do now?

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, take the exit.

                              GLENN
                 No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna
                 turn myself in.

     She reaches over and grabs the wheel.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 The fuck are you doing?!

     He hits the brakes.  The car goes off the road, down the grade,
     the abutment coming right at us as we go back to...

     THE HOSPITAL ROOM

     As Burdon sets the file down, sits back now.

                              KAREN
                 The next thing I knew, the paramedics
                 were taking me out the car.

     Burdon looks at Karen a moment, then...

                              BURDON
                 There's a couple of points I keep
                 wondering about have to do with the
                 two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is
                 it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I
                 swear the man must've robbed two hundred
                 banks in his time.

                              KAREN
                 Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't
                 remember how many he robbed.

                              BURDON
                 You talked to him?

                              KAREN
                 In the trunk, yeah?

                              BURDON
                 What'd you talk about?

                              KAREN
                 Oh... different things, prison, movies.

                              BURDON
                 This fella holds you hostage, you talk
                 about movies?

                              KAREN
                 It was an unusual experience.

                              BURDON
                 Foley made me think of that fella Carl
                 Tillman, the one you were seeing, it
                 turns out the same time he was doing
                 banks.  You recall that?

                              KAREN
                 When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't
                 know he robbed banks.

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe
                 he did, and I told you.  So you had to
                 at least suspect him.

                              KAREN
                 And what happened to Carl?

                              BURDON
                 The time came, you shot him.  But you
                 didn't shoot Foley or the guy with
                 him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
                 and you let them throw you in the trunk.
                 Okay, now you got your Sig in your
                 hand.  You say in the report you
                 couldn't turn around, he had you pinned
                 down.  But when the trunk opened, how
                 come you didn't cap the two guys then?

                              KAREN
                 Is that what you would've done?

                              BURDON
                 You say in the report Glenn didn't
                 have a gun, but you let him get away,
                 too.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel, what do you work on most of
                 the time, fraud?  Go after crooked
                 bookkeepers.

                              BURDON
                 Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen
                 years, on all kinds of investigations.

                              KAREN
                 Have you ever shot a man?  How many
                 times have you been primary through
                 the door?

                              BURDON
                 I have to qualify, is that it?

                              KAREN
                 You have to know what you're talking
                 about.

     We hear CHUCKLING OS.  Burdon glances at the doorway where we
     see Marshall now standing, enjoying this.

                              BURDON
                 We'll talk another time, Karen.  All
                 right?  I'd like to know why Foley put
                 you in that second car when he didn't
                 need you any more.

                              KAREN
                 You'll have to ask him.

                              BURDON
                 Sounds to me like he liked having you
                 around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr.
                 Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Agent Burdon.

     Marshall waits for him to walk out...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 The white man's Burdon.  That's what
                 everybody calls him in Miami.  The
                 Metro-Dade guys.  He's got a knack for
                 pissing people off.

     She's not listening.  He sits down, takes her hand...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 What are you thinking about?

                              KAREN
                 The Sig Sauer you got me for my
                 birthday.

                              MARSHALL
                 Tell you what, you're a good girl, you
                 might get another one for Christmas.

     She looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 I'll get it back when I get Foley.

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     A dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy
     climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm,
     newspaper under the other.  An old woman comes out the door as
     Buddy opens it and squints at him.

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen?

                              BUDDY
                 Uh, no, ma'am.  Sorry.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Buddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream.
     This one's nicer, with a view of the beach.  Jack stands on the
     balcony going through KAREN'S PURSE.

     He pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo.
     He does the same with her gym I.D. card.  He finds her address
     book and opens it up.  A photo of her father slips out.  Jack
     examines it a moment, then flips through the book.

     He stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in
     and comes up with her us Marshal I.D.  He slips it open and
     studies the badge and the picture opposite.

     He holds on to it, looks out at the ocean, but really sees...

     THE OPEN TRUNK OF THE CAR - LAST NIGHT

     As Karen gets out, saying...

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     BACK IN THE APARTMENT

     Foley turns away from the view as Buddy walks in, sets the
     grocery bag down on the coffee table.

                              BUDDY
                 You made the front page.

     He holds up the newspaper so that Foley can see his picture on
     the front page: an unflattering mug shot that doesn't look all
     that much like him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They pass this picture around you can
                 go anywhere you want, nobody'll know
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't feeling my best that day.
                 I'd just drawn thirty to life.

                              BUDDY
                 Maybe this'll make you feel better.

     Buddy reaches into the bag, tosses Foley a NEW ZIPPO.

                              FOLEY
                 Thanks.

     Foley catches the lighter, immediately begins playing with it.
     He looks at the paper on the coffee table as Buddy sits down,
     pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag.

                              BUDDY
                 Paper says there's ten grand each on
                 you, Chino and Lulu.

                              FOLEY
                 Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?

                              BUDDY
                 Just that she got away.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but what happened after she drove
                 off with Glenn?

                              BUDDY
                 You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most
                 likely, he's on his way to Detroit,
                 where we should be.

     Foley walks back out on to the balcony, looks at the contents of
     Karen's bag spread out on the table.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You realize what you're doing?  Worrying
                 about a person that works in law
                 enforcement.  You want to sit down and
                 have cocktails with a girl that tried
                 to shoot you.  You hear what I'm saying?

     Foley holds up the picture of Marshall Sisco.

                              FOLEY
                 Think this old guy is her boyfriend?
                 It's the only picture she carries.

                              BUDDY
                 Am I going to Detroit by myself?

     Foley picks up her drivers licence photo.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Longer we hang around down here, Jack,
                 better chance there is either Glenn's
                 gonna fuck up the whole score, or we
                 gonna get busted, or both.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll leave first thing in the morning.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Right on a marina.  Boats bobbing on the water.

                              MARSHALL (VO)
                 Is this Foley?

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Marshall sits in his chair holding up a newspaper as Karen hands
     him a drink.  She stares at the photograph.

                              KAREN
                 He doesn't even look like that.

                              MARSHALL
                 No?

                              KAREN
                 No, he looks a lot...

     She realizes Marshall's watching her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Different.

     The doorbell RINGS.  She ignores his look, gets up.  Walks to
     the door and opens it to reveal RAY NICOLET, boots, leather
     jacket, etc.  Cowboy Cop.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hi, Ray.

                              RAY
                 You look great.  Your dad taking good
                 care of you?

                              KAREN
                 He took the week off so we'd have time
                 together.  So far he's worked on his
                 boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.

     Marshall gets up, shakes his head.

                              RAY
                 I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Likewise.

                              KAREN
                 Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force,
                 working on the prison break.

                              MARSHALL
                      (eyeing his T-shirt)
                 I see that.

     Ray turns to Karen, holding his jacket open to show the task
     force inscription on his T-shirt in red, the guy's .357 tucked
     into his waistband.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 In case no one knows what he does.
                 Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says,
                 "Undercover"?

                              RAY
                 No.  Course not.

                              KAREN
                      (changing the subject)
                 How's it going?

                              RAY
                 Great.  We got one of 'em.

     Karen looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

                              MARSHALL
                      (before he can answer)
                 Off a tip?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in
                 this hobo camp out by the airport,
                 called the number--

                              MARSHALL
                 I knew it, soon as I saw they were
                 offering a reward.

     She grabs Nicolet by the arm.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

     Marshall looks at her.

                              RAY
                 Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the
                 Cubans.  Linares.

                              KAREN
                 Oh...

                              RAY
                 We went out there, full SWAT, two
                 choppers, the whole bit, but Linares
                 started shooting anyway.  We put him
                 down, but somehow Chirino got away.

                              MARSHALL
                 Did you pay the guy the reward?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, as soon as we got back.

                              KAREN
                 Foley hadn't been there?

     Her father gives her a look.

                              RAY
                 This place was strictly Cuban.  If
                 Foley had a ride he must have his own
                 agenda. He seems to be the only one
                 knows what he's doing.

     THE PHONE RINGS.  Marshall moves to it.

                              MARSHALL
                 Hello?
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.
                      (hands her the phone)
                 For you.

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

     CUT TO: FOLEY ON THE PHONE - DAY

     On the balcony.  Flipping through a copy of Vogue while Buddy
     watches television inside.

                              FOLEY
                 Hi.

     INTERCUTTING KAREN & FOLEY - DAY

     Karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray
     drones on.

                              FOLEY
                 You know who this is?

                              KAREN
                 Yes.

     She walks out to her father's balcony now.

                              FOLEY
                 I just wanted to see if you're okay,
                 make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or,
                 you know, anything.

                              MARSHALL
                 Something I've been wondering, Ray...

     Marshall picks up the newspaper...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 It says in the headline, "I slept with
                 a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."
                 She lives in Little Havana, her
                 husband's out of town working when one
                 of the escapees shows up at her door...

     She closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you get this number?

                              FOLEY
                 Who was it answered the phone?

                              KAREN
                 None of your business.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just worried maybe I'm not old
                 enough for you.

                              KAREN
                 That's my dad.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.  He has a cop's face.

                              KAREN
                 How do you know?  Wait-- you have my
                 wallet.

                              FOLEY
                 And your gun.

                              KAREN
                 Think I could have them back?

                              FOLEY
                 How do we do that?

                              KAREN
                 Let's see.  You could come on by my
                 dad's place, drop 'em off.

                              FOLEY
                 Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the
                 S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.

     Foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's
     been looking for: an ad for Defiance perfume.

                              KAREN
                 There's a guy here on the task force
                 right now.  Maybe I should put him on
                 the phone, let you two work it out.

                              FOLEY
                 You won't do that.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              FOLEY
                 Because you're having too much fun.

     She doesn't know what to say to that.  Foley smells the ad.

     INSIDE THE HOUSE

                              MARSHALL
                 ...She fixes him pork chops and rice,
                 the next thing you know they're making
                 love on the sofa.  She says he was
                 very gentle.

                              RAY
                 I spoke to her.  The guy told her he
                 missed his little girl and she felt
                 sorry for him.

                              MARSHALL
                 That's how you score now?

     ON THE PATIO:

     Karen looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet.

                              KAREN
                 My dad's retired.  He was a Private
                 Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to
                 work for him.

                              FOLEY
                 I can just picture that, a cute girl
                 like you following slip-and-fall and
                 whiplash cheaters.

                              KAREN
                 Something I've been wondering, what
                 ever happened to your Uncle Cully?

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  You think he might tell you where
                 I am?

                              KAREN
                 Unless you wanna tell me.

                              FOLEY
                 He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years
                 before he came out and died not too
                 long after in Charity Hospital, I think
                 trying to make up for all the good
                 times he'd missed.
                      (then)
                 That's not gonna be me.

                              KAREN
                 One last score, that the idea?  Move
                 to some island.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm partial to mountains myself.  But
                 if you like islands, we'll make it an
                 island.

                              KAREN
                 Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?

                              FOLEY
                 I just thought maybe you and me could--

     Buddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles Foley.

                              BUDDY
                 Who you talking to?

                              KAREN
                 Is that Buddy?

     Foley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone.  He looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 What?!

                              BUDDY
                 You better come see this.

     INT. MARSHALL'S CONDO - DAY

     As Karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up,
     opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room.

                              RAY
                 The woman also said he stole her
                 husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol,
                 and some of his clothes.

                              MARSHALL
                 So the woman's married.  She goes to
                 bed with this prison escapee because
                 he misses his little girl and then
                 tells the world about it.  But you
                 don't reveal her name, you protect
                 her.  It sounds like you're saying
                 it's okay as long as her husband doesn't
                 find out about it.  Like the guy who
                 cheats on his wife, saying what she
                 doesn't know won't hurt her.

                              KAREN
                 Dad.

     He looks over at her now.  Gives her an innocent look.

                              MARSHALL
                 What?

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at
     the hobo camp.  We catch a glimpse of RAY NICOLET, GUN IN HIS
     WAISTBAND, STICKING HIS CHEST OUT FOR THE CAMERA.

     Foley shakes his head as they show a shot of Lulu's body covered
     with a sheet.

                              FOLEY
                 Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

                              BUDDY
                 He's running for his life, he doesn't
                 give a shit about you.

                              FOLEY
                 He's gotta know by now that I gave him
                 up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna
                 try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele,
                 see what she knows.

                              BUDDY
                 He knows where she lives?

     Foley doesn't answer.  Buddy mutes the set.  Turns to Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 We were talking one time, drinking
                 rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how
                 she worked for a magician.  Chino got
                 interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How
                 does he saw the woman in half?  He
                 wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at
                 her if she ever came to visit.

                              BUDDY
                 So call her up.  Tell her don't talk
                 to any Cubans.

                              FOLEY
                 Her phone's probably tapped.

                              BUDDY
                 And you know they're gonna have some
                 people watching the hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S BOAT - DAY

     Karen stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints
     the trim on the boat.

                              MARSHALL
                 Remember, pay attention to how she
                 talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it
                 right, she'll tell you things she
                 wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you
                 think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell
                 her about being in the trunk with him,
                 in the dark for half an hour, and see
                 how she takes it.  If she's in on it,
                 what does she get for all the
                 aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I
                 bet nothing.  So she still likes him
                 enough to stick her neck out.  You
                 think that's possible?  What kind of
                 guy is he?

                              KAREN
                 He's pretty laid back, confident.

                              MARSHALL
                 He remind you of that guy, Tillman?

                              KAREN
                 Not at all.

                              MARSHALL
                 But you know he's dirty and you still
                 wanna see him again.

                              KAREN
                 I want to bust his ass, put him in
                 shackles.

                              MARSHALL
                 Maybe.  But you're also curious about
                 the man.  Twice last night you asked
                 your married boyfriend Nicolet about
                 him.  You were concerned, but you didn't
                 want to show it.

                              KAREN
                 My married boyfriend - setting him up
                 with that news story so you could talk
                 about infidelity.  I couldn't believe
                 it.

                              MARSHALL
                 You like the wild ones, don't you?
                 Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You
                 know, I've always said there's a thin
                 line between the cowboy cops and the
                 armed robbers, all those guys that
                 love to pack.

                              KAREN
                 Foley kidnapped me.

                              MARSHALL
                 Yeah, but you talked all the way from
                 GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more
                 like a first date than a kidnapping.
                 
     She gives him a look.  He goes back to his painting.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 Go talk to the ex-wife.

     INT. ADELE DELISI'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass-topped
     dining table and turns on the window air-conditioner when THE
     PHONE RINGS.  She grabs it...

                              ADELE
                 Hi, this is Adele speaking.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - DAY

     Adele's neighbourhood.  Near the beach.  Chino on the phone.  He
     wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit...

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is this Adele?

                              ADELE (PHONE)
                 Yes, it is.

                              CHINO
                 Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.

     He hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in
     one of his pockets.  As he then starts off down the street, we
     can see the name "COLOR MY WORLD HOUSEPAINTING" on the back of
     the jumpsuit.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     Buddy drives.  Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit --
     is beside him.  Buddy looks at him, shakes his head.

                              BUDDY
                 Nice disguise.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm a tourist.

                              BUDDY
                 You at least bring the gun?

                              FOLEY
                      (lifts straw bag)
                 In here with my suntan lotion and beach
                 towel.
                      (points)
                 That's her place.

     As they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front,
     obviously FBI...

                              BUDDY
                 There.  You see the guy sitting on the
                 porch?  The old ladies and one guy?
                 You know they'll have a couple more in
                 a car somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                      (watching something
                       else)
                 Uh-huh...

     Buddy follows Foley's gaze to...

     ACROSS THE STREET

     As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse
     for change.  She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she
     bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh...

                              BUDDY
                 Oh, my.

     Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under
     the car and grab it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you saw her.  That's all you
                 get.

     They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG
     AGENT her ID...

                              FOLEY
                 I guess Adele's in good hands.

                              BUDDY
                 Sure looks that way.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 Let's go to Detroit.

                              BUDDY
                 Now you're talkin'.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the
     narrow opening.

                              ADELE
                 You were both in the trunk?  Together?

                              KAREN
                 From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I
                 left with Glenn.

     Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up,
     heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss.

                              KAREN
                 The FBI didn't tell you I was with
                 them?

                              ADELE
                 They didn't tell me anything, they
                 asked questions.

                              KAREN
                 But you know what I'm talking about,
                 don't you?  About Glenn, don't you,
                 and the second car?

                              ADELE
                 I know a Glenn.

     She thinks a moment.  The door closes and opens again, all the
     way.  Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties,
     but no bra.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'm getting ready to go out.  You can
                 come in if you want, sit down for a
                 minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
                 
                              KAREN
                 No, thanks.

     She comes in, checks out the place.  She turns a chair from the
     glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the
     kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes.

                              ADELE
                 Those are cute shoes.  The kind of
                 jobs I get, I have to wear these killer
                 spikes, they ruin your feet.

     She walks away, comes back with an ashtray.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 When you were in the trunk with Jack...

     Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?

                              KAREN
                 You mean, did he try to jump me?  No,
                 but he was kind of talkative.

                              ADELE
                 He gets that way when he's nervous
                 sometimes.

     Adele sits down at the other end of the table.

                              KAREN
                 You didn't visit him in prison.

                              ADELE
                 He didn't want me to.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              ADELE
                 I don't know.  He was different after
                 he was sentenced, looking at thirty
                 years.  Said it depressed him every
                 time the younger cons called him an
                 old timer.

                              KAREN
                 But you spoke to him on the phone.

                              ADELE
                 He'd call every once in a while.

                              KAREN
                 He called the day he escaped.

                              ADELE
                 He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say
                 about me?  In the trunk?

                              KAREN
                      (beat, lies)
                 He said he wished the two of you could
                 start over, live a normal life.

                              ADELE
                 Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a
                 normal life is robbing banks.  It's
                 all he's ever done.

                              KAREN
                 Did you know that when you married
                 him?

                              ADELE
                 He said he was a card player.  I could
                 live with that.  I never knew he robbed
                 banks till he got busted with that car
                 that caught fire -- if you can imagine
                 something like that happening, comes
                 out of the bank and the car's on fire.
                 I did go see him in jail to tell him I
                 was filing for divorce.  He said,
                 "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.
                      (then)
                 He was fun, but never what you'd call
                 a real husband.

     Adele looks out the window.  Karen waits, looks to an end table
     where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere
     ten years back.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'll say one thing for Jack, he was
                 never ugly or mean, or drank too much.
                 He was very considerate, lights on or
                 off, if you know what I mean.

                              KAREN
                 Really.
                      (looking at the picture)
                 Hm.

     She realizes Adele is looking at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get
                 caught.  I'd like to get him before he
                 does something else, makes it worse on
                 himself.

                              ADELE
                 Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him
                 out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience.
                 Always has been.
                      (chuckles)
                 He tell you how they met?

     Karen shakes her head.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Jack came out of a bank he just robbed
                 in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen
                 car to start.  Battery was dead.  He
                 looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a
                 burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers
                 him a thousand dollars for a jump.
                 Turns out, Buddy was casing the same
                 bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy
                 says, I'll take the thousand, but we're
                 leaving in my car, not that piece of
                 shit you come in.
                      (then)
                 They musta robbed fifty banks together.

                              KAREN
                 Till they got busted.

                              ADELE
                 That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that
                 was on account of Buddy, for some
                 reason, decided to call his sister and
                 confess to a job before they'd done it
                 instead of after.  She called the FBI
                 and they both went down, ended up at
                 Lompoc.
                      (then)
                 I think Buddy felt kinda bad about
                 that.

                              KAREN
                 Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or
                 Glenn?

     Adele looks at Karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick
     raps on the door.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Adele?  You in there?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 I want to speak with you, please.

                              ADELE
                 Who is it?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 I talk to the guy you work for, Emil.
                 He tole me your number and where you
                 live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant
                 and would like to speak to you.

                              ADELE
                 Oh.  Uh-huh.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You did work for Emil, right?

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost
                 four years.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You were his what, his box?

                              ADELE
                 His assistant.

     Karen looks at the door.  Something's wrong... through the glass
     bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement
     on the other side, someone doing something...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 You say you perform in the Miami area?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in
                 Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the
                 Mayishan was my name.

     And now Karen and Adele look at each other.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Can you open the door?

     Karen shakes her head "no."

                              ADELE
                 I'm not dressed.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen to me.
                      (lowers his voice)
                 I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

     Boom.  Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of
     the table, sees Adele staring at her.

                              KAREN
                 Ask him his name.

                              ADELE
                 Who are you?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                      (beat)
                 Jose Chirino.

     Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me
                 Chino.  I'm the same person.

     Karen moves along the table to Adele...

                              KAREN
                      (soft)
                 Tell him to wait in the hall, you have
                 to get dressed.  Say it loud.

     As Adele speaks, Karen racks the slide on her 9mm.

                              ADELE
                 Wait in the hall!  I have to get
                 dressed!

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't
                 bother you no more.

     Karen motions for Adele to keep talking as she takes a position
     beside the door, where we now see Chino's silhouette in one of
     the three glass panels in the centre of the door.

                              ADELE
                 I don't know where he is.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape
                 from prison.  He tole me, I can't find
                 him to see you.  So why don't you open
                 this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can
                 speak.

                              ADELE
                      (staring at Karen)
                 Go away, or I'll call the police.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

     Adele says nothing.  Then...

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you don't want to help me, I'm
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I'm going now.  I see you maybe some
                 time, okay?  Bye bye.

                              KAREN
                      (low)
                 Go in the bedroom and --

     Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes
     through one of the glass panels.  Adele and Karen both jump as
     Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob...

     ...but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight
     as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm
     still sticking through the glass...

     ...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he
     bangs against a wall and falls to the floor.  Dazed, Chino
     reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet.

     Karen brings up her Beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the
     front sight on his chest.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Leave it where it is.

                              CHINO
                      (frowning)
                 Wait.  You not Adele?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I
                 mean, now.

                              CHINO
                 Oh.  Then this must be Adele...

     He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele.

                              KAREN
                 Put it down or I'll shoot.

                              CHINO
                 You wouldn't shoot me, would you?

                              KAREN
                 What do you want to bet?

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 I could walk out of here.

                              KAREN
                 If you move, if you look at her again,
                 you're dead.

     Chino doesn't move.  Keeps his gun on Adele.  Karen starts
     walking towards him...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You can live or die, it's up to you.

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot
                 me?  Nice girl like you?
                      (smiles)
                 I don't think so.

                              KAREN
                 You don't, huh?

     And with that, she kicks him in the knee.  Chino buckles over
     and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 On your knees.

     He does as he's told.  Karen raises his jacket, feels around
     his waist from behind.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Lie face down on the floor.

                              CHINO
                      (hurting)
                 What?!

     She kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there.  She puts
     her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials.  She
     sees Adele staring at her.

                              CHINO (CONT'D)
                      (to Adele)
                 Excuse me...

     Karen looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone...

                              KAREN
                 Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.

                              CHINO
                 Excuse me, Adele?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 You do the sawing of the box in half
                 trick with you inside?

                              ADELE
                      (beat)
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 Tell me, how do you do that?

     Adele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with
     her foot.

                              KAREN
                 Shut up.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying
                 to get a hold of you.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel.  Listen --

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Where are you?  I been trying to reach
                 you.

                              KAREN
                 I'm at Adele Delisi's.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 What-- we already talked to her.  That's
                 a dead end.

                              KAREN
                      (looking at Chino)
                 Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving.
                 Why were you trying to reach me?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around
                 the same time Foley was there.  We got
                 an address for him at the Adams Hotel
                 in Hallandale.  I want you to go there,
                 see if you can get the manager to i.d.
                 him as the other guy.  If he does, you
                 call me right away...

                              KAREN
                 All right, but...

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 But don't you do anything.  You just
                 have a seat, wait for me to get there.

                              KAREN
                 Sure, Daniel.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Now.  What is it you wanted to tell
                 me?

                              KAREN
                 Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to
                 bring in Chirino, would you put me on
                 the task force?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                      (impatient)
                 What?  Is that what you're calling me
                 about?

                              KAREN
                 Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will
                 you let me go after Foley?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in
                 Chirino, you can be on the task
                 force.

                              KAREN
                 That's all I wanted to know.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife
                 and get over to the Adams Hotel.

     Karen hangs up, looks at Adele.  Adele nods.

                              ADELE
                 You're good.

                              KAREN
                 Thank you.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing we do, we get to Detroit,
                 we find Glenn, then we find a window
                 to throw him out of.

                              BUDDY
                 I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was
                 up there to take down the Ripper, where
                 would I go?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, first off, if you were Glenn,
                 you wouldn't be thinking.

                              BUDDY
                 Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal
                 from Lompoc?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be
                 brain dead by now.

                              BUDDY
                 He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told
                 me the Snoop's been managing some guys
                 up there now, works out at the Kronk.

     INT. SHALAMAR APARTMENTS - LOBBY - NIGHT

     The ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters
     with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running
     shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags.
     Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 You get the key?

                              KAREN
                 They're in 7D.

     She hands it to him as they wait for the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 I want two men outside, front and back.
                 Conway and Jessup go on up to seven,
                 cover both ends of the hall.

     Burdon, Karen and the remaining four SWAT team agents.  Burden
     looks at them one at a time.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 You're primary, you're secondary, you're
                 point man.

                              KAREN
                 You're gonna use a ram?

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, why?

                              KAREN
                 The manager's door is metal.

     They all look at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know what I mean?  They might all be.
                 And a ram on a metal door makes an awful
                 lot of noise for what good it does.

     Burdon looks at her, not all that happy she spoke up.  The fourth
     man raises the shotgun, a three-inch strip of metal taped to
     the muzzle.

                              FOURTH MAN
                 I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun
                 oughta do the trick.

                              BURDON
                 Fine.  Whatever.

     He sees the elevator still hasn't come down.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Fuck it.  Let's take the stairs.
                 Karen...

     Burdon pauses, looks at Karen, hands her a radio.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Take the radio, stay down here in the
                 lobby, watch the elevator.

                              KAREN
                 What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.

                              BURDON
                 You can go wait out in the car, you
                 want to.

     She doesn't say anything.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg
                 come in behind us, whatta you do?

                              KAREN
                      (pissed)
                 Call and tell you.

                              BURDON
                 And you let them come up.  You don't
                 try to make the bust yourself.  You
                 understand?

     Before she can answer, an old woman steps in, asks Burdon...

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Are you delivering the oxygen?

     Burdon looks at her, then nods for his men to start up the
     stairs.

     ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY

     Everyone's in position as Burdon eases the key into the lock,
     turns it.  The door won't budge, a dead bolt holds it shut.

     The guy with the shotgun puts the strip of metal against the
     seam, where the lock enters the frame, the muzzle of the shotgun
     exactly three inches now from the dead bolt, and looks over his
     shoulder at Burdon.

     With the sound of the blast, we then...

     CUT TO:  INSIDE THE ELEVATOR - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy ride down with an old lady.  The doors open.
     The woman doesn't move.

                              BUDDY
                 Is this your floor, mother?

                              OLD LADY
                 Oh.  Yes, it is.

     INT. THE LOBBY - SAME TIME - DAY

     As an old gent in a golf cap smiles at Karen sitting there on
     the couch in front of the elevator...

                              OLD GENT
                 Like to play some gin?

                              KAREN
                 No, thank you.

     He creeps off towards the elevator.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Burdon and his men fan out through the place...

     INT. LOBBY - DAY

     As we hear Burdon's voice.

                              BURDON (RADIO)
                 Karen.  They're not up here.  Keep
                 your eyes open.

     Karen looks off towards the street entrance, then back at the
     elevator where the man is still waiting, leaning on his cane.

     The elevator door opens to reveal Buddy and Foley.

                              OLD GENT
                 Going up?

     Buddy and Foley don't answer.  The old man starts to get on,
     feeling with his cane, taking forever.

     Karen and Foley are staring at each other.  He doesn't move.
     Not until the elevator door begins to close.

     Buddy sees Karen, helps the old man aboard as...

     Karen picks up her radio, is about to speak into it when...

     Foley raises his hand.  And waves as the door closes.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     As the elevator resumes going down.

                              OLD GENT
                 Shit, I wanted to go up.

                              BUDDY
                 Let's just hope there's no one in the
                 garage.

                              FOLEY
                 She looked right at me.  She didn't
                 yell or get excited.  She didn't move.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As they get in and Buddy starts the car...

                              BUDDY
                 They know where I live, I guess they
                 know what I drive, so maybe we should
                 pick up another car on the way.

                              FOLEY
                 She just sat there, looking right at
                 me.

     Buddy gives him a look, shakes his head and then burns rubber
     out of the garage as we...

     CUT TO: A CLOSE-UP OF KAREN - DAY

     Staring straight ahead.

                              BURDON (ON THE RADIO)
                 Karen.  Report.  You see anything?
                 Karen?  You there?  Karen...?

     INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

     As Marshall walks Karen to the gate.

                              MARSHALL
                 He waved to you?

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty
                 sure he did.

                              MARSHALL
                 You wave back?

                              KAREN
                 I didn't have time.

                              MARSHALL
                 I imagine you would've though.

     She shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got
                 two calls from Buddy up in Detroit
                 this morning, called Burdon.  She's
                 also the one gave Burdon Buddy's
                 address.

                              MARSHALL
                 So?

                              KAREN
                 So what I want to know is why Buddy
                 still calls his sister every week even
                 after she turned him in.

                              MARSHALL
                 He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
                      (then)
                 What I want to know is why, they got
                 such a big score up north, did Foley
                 hang around Miami for so long?
                      (looks at her)
                 Any thoughts on that one?

                              KAREN
                 None I'd like to share.

     She gives him a kiss...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'll call soon as I get in.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - DETROIT - DAY

     Snow.  Everywhere.  A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the
     neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes.

                              MAURICE (VO)
                 I don't just manage fighters, or deal
                 product any more...

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Glenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka "Snoopy" --
     wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses.

                              MAURICE
                 I've diversified since the last time
                 you saw me.  I've vertically integrated
                 and now I'm into home invasions and
                 the occasional grand larceny.

     Glenn just nods, stares out the window.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my
                 bodyguard when I feel I need one, and
                 my driver.

     Maurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved-
     looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Watch the road, boy.
                      (then)
                 I like this Town Car.  We can cruise
                 the man's neighbourhood without getting
                 the police or private security people
                 on our ass.

                              GLENN
                 Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving
                 around a black guy wearing shades and
                 a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they
                 won't think anything of it.

                              MAURICE
                 It's lilac, man, the color, and the
                 style's made known by Deion and other
                 defensive backs in the pros.  I could
                 be one of them living out here with
                 doctors of my race and basketball
                 players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's
                 house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick
                 wall.  There's his drive, right there.

     The car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming
                 up here, do this themself?

                              GLENN
                 If they're not busted now, they're
                 gonna be.
                      (then)
                 It's wide open.

     EXT./INT. CAR - MAURICE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DETROIT - LATER

     People on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black
     Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and
     snow-covered trash.

                              GLENN
                 So you still haven't said, how you
                 wanna do it?

                              MAURICE
                 I'll show you, soon as I get one more
                 guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother,
                 Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.

                              GLENN
                 What?

     The car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a
     bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always
     seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in.

                              MAURICE
                 You get everything?

     Kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat.  Glenn stares at
     it.  Something about the bag makes him uneasy.  Maybe it's the
     HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Cool.  Kenneth, this is the man I told
                 you about, Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 The one gonna help us rip off the rich
                 guy?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              GLENN
                 Help you...

     White Boy Bob pulls out again.  Glenn looks at the two psychos
     in front, then turns to Maurice.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on
                 this, not all your friends.

                              MAURICE
                 You just ask me how we gonna do it.
                 That's what I'm here for, tell you
                 how.  We the experts.

     Glenn can't believe this is happening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Thing I'm worried about is you.

                              GLENN
                 Me?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah.  If you can step up and actually
                 do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just
                 talking the talk.

                              GLENN
                 Can I do what?

                              MAURICE
                 Walk in a house with me, do this cross-
                 dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I
                 used to sell to been dealin' on his
                 own.

                              GLENN
                 What-- when?

                              MAURICE
                 Right now, son.

                              GLENN
                 I don't have to prove shit to you.
                 The Ripley job is my job.  You're either
                 in or you're not.  You wanna pop some
                 crack dealer pissed you off, that's
                 your problem, not mine.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you
                 don't have to give me no tone of voice,
                 okay?  You don't like what I'm saying,
                 you can get out anywhere along here
                 you want.

                              GLENN
                 I think you're forgetting, this is my
                 car.  I drove it up here.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this
                 car, man, it's mine.  You go get
                 yourself another one.  I say I'm in on
                 Ripley?  I'm in, with or without your
                 ass.  I say I want you to come along
                 on another job, see if you for real or
                 not, guess what you gonna do?

     Glenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We're here.

     Glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit-
     looking two-story house.  Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the
     hack saw and a HAND AXE up to White Boy Bob, a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN
     to Kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go see Eddie.

     Glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear...

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 Must take balls, do what you do.

     EXT. LOMPOC FPC - YARD - DAY

     As Foley walks with Ripley across the yard.

                              RIPLEY
                 Tell me something.  What's it like,
                 walk in a bank with a gun, stick it
                 up?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I never used a gun.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?

                              FOLEY
                 You'd be surprised what all you can
                 get, you ask for it the right way.

                              RIPLEY
                      (smiles)
                 You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep
                 all my money in banks.

                              FOLEY
                 No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?
                      (Ripley smiles)
                 I'm talking about all those uncut
                 diamonds you told Glenn about.

                              RIPLEY
                      (still smiling)
                 I know what you're talking about.

                              FOLEY
                 You're the one with balls, Dick, say
                 something like that to someone like
                 Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where
                 you were for a minute.

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn?
                 I mean, do you believe Glenn?

                              FOLEY
                 Of course not.

                              RIPLEY
                 Plus, even it was true, he'd still
                 have to figure out where I keep 'em.

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You
                 told him you keep 'em at your house.

                              RIPLEY
                      (shrugs, big smile)
                 It's a big house.

     Ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the
     yard.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Tell me something, Jack, how much longer
                 you in here?

                              FOLEY
                 Twenty-two months, three days, two
                 hours.  Why?

                              RIPLEY
                 I was just thinking that I could use a
                 guy like you, someone knows how to ask
                 for things the right way.  I'm talkin'
                 about when you're outta here.  I mean,
                 you can't rob banks for ever.

     Foley looks at Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a little late for me.

                              RIPLEY
                 Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make
                 my first million until I was forty-
                 two.  Forty-two.  You really want to
                 change, it's never too late.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I'm not exactly the
                 nine-to-five type.

                              RIPLEY
                 Who is?  But then you gotta look at a
                 job as more than just work.  You gotta
                 look at it as peace of mind.  As
                 security, you know what I mean?  I got
                 offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston,
                 take your pick.

                              FOLEY
                 My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down
                 there.

                              RIPLEY
                 No need to decide now.  Be like the
                 fish.  Let whatever happens happen.

                              FOLEY
                 The fish?

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, fish live in the present.  They
                 don't dwell on yesterday and they don't
                 worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big
                 fish attacks a little fish, there's no
                 neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward.
                 No whining on some fish-shrink's couch.
                 They just do it.  They accept.

                              FOLEY
                 I can't say that I've paid that much
                 attention to 'em before.

                              RIPLEY
                 The fish saved my life.  Two years
                 ago, I found out I had high blood
                 pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me
                 to go get an aquarium, look at the
                 fish every time I felt myself stressing
                 out.

                              FOLEY
                 And the guy sent you a bill for this?

                              RIPLEY
                 It works.  You should try it sometime.

                              FOLEY
                 The next time I walk into a bank.

     Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...

                              RIPLEY
                 Think about my offer, Jack.

     Foley watches him go.

                              BUDDY (V.O.)
                 Hey, Jack...

     CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF FOLEY

     As he turns to us.

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR

     Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red-
     brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.

                              BUDDY
                 You see this one...

     Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 "Fight over tuna casserole may have
                 spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's
                 live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
                 complained about her tuna noodle
                 casserole and she shot him in the face
                 with a twelve-gauge.  Police found
                 noodles in the woman's hair and think
                 the guy dumped the casserole dish on
                 her before she shot him.  They'd been
                 together ten years.

                              FOLEY
                 Love is funny.

     Buddy looks at him.  Notices something over Foley's shoulder.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey--

     And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car
     pulls into the Kronk parking lot.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

     Kenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the
     front seat.  Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging
     himself, shaking.  Maurice looks out the window...

                              MAURICE
                 Was a time you see a gold Mercedes
                 over in the parking lot has a license
                 plate on it say HITMAN?  You know Tommy
                 Hearns is inside.  Seeing the car would
                 get our juices flowing.

     Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You already got your juices flowing,
                 huh?  Pissed your pants back there at
                 Eddie's house, didn't you?

     Glenn just looks at Maurice.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That was some shit, huh?

                              GLENN
                      (indicates Kenneth)
                 Why'd he have to do that to that girl?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that
                 to that poor girl.

                              KENNETH
                      (smiles)
                 Do what?

     Glenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth.

                              MAURICE
                 Just wait till we get inside Ripley's
                 house.

     And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car.

                              GLENN
                 It's all right with you, I'll just
                 hang in the car.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 No.  You gonna stay close to me from
                 now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

                              GLENN
                 Why would I do that?

     Maurice looks at him, starts laughing.  White Boy Bob and Kenneth
     join in.  Maurice leans over... Glenn flinches as Maurice opens
     Glenn's jacket so that we can see the BLOOD splattered on his T-
     shirt.

                              MAURICE
                 Was worse than you imagined, wasn't
                 it?
                      (then, smiles)
                 Baby, you with the bad boys now.

     INT. FOLEY AND BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the
     car.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you think?

                              FOLEY
                 I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
                 now we got us another partner.

                              BUDDY
                 Or two.

     INT. BOXING GYM - DAY

     Glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring.
     Kenneth grabs a magazine, walks into the john.  A shirtless
     White Boy Bob lifts weights while Maurice moves around the ring
     calling to the boxers inside.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab!

                              VOICE
                 Hey, Studs, how you doing?

     He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing
                 here?

     They sit down on either side of him, close.

                              FOLEY
                 Weren't you expecting us?

                              GLENN
                 That broad you picked up -- did you
                 know she was a US Marshal, for Christ
                 sake?

     Now he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat
     and sits down again.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 She knew me from some bullshit dope
                 bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice.
                 You know what she said, we're in the
                 car on the turnpike?  "I never forget
                 anybody I've cuffed and shackled."

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  She said that to you?

     Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face,
     almost smiling.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 What happened to your shades?  Someone
                 finally step on 'em?

                              GLENN
                      (touches his head)
                 I don't know...

     Foley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 Whose blood you got all over you?

                              GLENN
                 These guys, man, they're crazy.
                      (looks off)
                 Shit.

     Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy
     Bob beside him, carrying his shirts.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo
                 rag?

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now, tell fortunes?

     Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley
     to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We have a problem here?

                              MAURICE
                      (walking over)
                 Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

                              MAURICE
                 It seems to me I been reading about
                 you in the newspaper.  Busted out of
                 some joint in Florida, huh?

                              FOLEY
                 Low class of people there, Snoop.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You call him that again I'll put your
                 head through the wall.

                              BUDDY
                 What?  You mean Snoop?

                              MAURICE
                 Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy,
                 is what White Boy's trying to say.
                 He's a little crude, you understand.
                 No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me.

                              BUDDY
                 But you call this bozo White Boy?

                              GLENN
                 White Boy Bob.
                      (baiting)
                 White Boy used to be a fighter.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now outside of shoot his
                 mouth off?

     White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit.

                              FOLEY
                 Like being back in the yard, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Just like it.  Nobody backing down.
                 You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what
                 you and Buddy doing up here in the
                 cold?

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn didn't tell you?

                              GLENN
                 I thought you guys were busted.

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  Just because you left us standing
                 on the side of the road?

     Foley looks at Glenn.  Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously.  Foley
     smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard.  Now Maurice
     starts laughing.  Buddy, too.  White Boy's lost, looking from
     one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile
     going away as he says...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn
                 promised you or what you think you're
                 gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy
                 get half of whatever we take from
                 Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn
                 cut up the rest is up to you.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go outside and talk.

                              FOLEY
                 What's the matter with right here?
                 It's nice and warm.

                              MAURICE
                 Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees
                 in here, sometimes a hundred -- the
                 way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd
                 sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy
                 Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any
                 business in here.  To me this is holy
                 ground, man.  You understand?  I got
                 to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to
                 talk, come to the fights tomorrow night,
                 we'll sit down and look at it good.
                 The State Theater.

     Foley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll see you tomorrow then.

     Maurice then watches as they walk out.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, how much is the reward on
                 the man again?

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Ten gees.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.
                      (then)
                 You recall, did it say dead or alive?

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier.
     Now it's a CRIME SCENE.  A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers
     stand just behind the yellow tape.  A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up
     the front yard.

     Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly-
     freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control.

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Ray Cruz.

                              COP
                 He's inside.
                      (pissed)
                 With everybody else.

     Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk.  She pauses
     to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD
     BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window.

     INT. HOUSE - SAME

     Hell.  Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in
     the doorway.  Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A
     MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the
     chest.  He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist.

     Congealed blood runs down the stairs.  COPS and CRIME SCENE
     TECHS are everywhere.  Karen looks at the guy on the stairs.

                              VOICE
                 Called themselves the Youngboys.

     Karen looks over as RAYMOND CRUZ, a stocky, genial-looking
     detective comes out of the kitchen.

                              CRUZ
                 Ironic, isn't it?

                              KAREN
                 How are you, Raymond?

                              CRUZ
                 Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.

     He kisses her on the cheek.  She indicates the body by the door.

                              KAREN
                 Quite a mess.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked
                 Eddie.

                              KAREN
                 Who?

                              CRUZ
                 Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon,
                 used to buy scag off a corner till he
                 kicked it and found his happiness with
                 crack and then started dealing himself.
                 Word on the street was he was saving
                 up for an operation.

                              KAREN
                 What is it with crack and transsexuals?

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had
                 these girls cooked the rocks he called
                 the Rockettes.

                              KAREN
                 Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.

                              CRUZ
                 Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped
                 her, shot her, then threw her out the
                 window.
                      (shakes his head)
                 Fuckin' animals.

     This shuts them both up.  Cruz indicates the door.

                              CRUZ (CONT'D)
                 Let's get some air.

     She starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on
     the ground...

     A BROKEN PAIR OF SUNGLASSES

     Wrap-around... a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing.
     Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out.

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     As Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press
     photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene.

                              CRUZ
                 Other than we had so much fun the last
                 time we worked together.  You gonna
                 tell me why you're comin' to me instead
                 of the FBI?

                              KAREN
                 I report to the FBI, first thing they're
                 gonna do is ask me to go get some
                 coffee.

                              CRUZ
                 You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

                              KAREN
                 No, I didn't know that.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and
                 property now, also sex crimes and child
                 abuse.

                              KAREN
                 Detroit, you must be pretty busy.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions
                 are big, too.

                              KAREN
                 Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had
                 this guy Glenn Michaels on possession
                 with intent but couldn't make it stick.
                 In his statement, Glenn said he went
                 up to Detroit to visit a friend and
                 look into job opportunities -- if you
                 can believe that.

                              CRUZ
                 Who was the friend?

                              KAREN
                 Guy named Maurice Miller, also known
                 as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.

                              CRUZ
                 Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a
                 fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray
                 Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other
                 Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.

                              KAREN
                 I'll need a last known address.

                              CRUZ
                 That's fine, but I don't want you to
                 talk to Miller alone.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer,
                 I'm armed.

     He turns and looks at her.

                              CRUZ
                 Yes, you are.  I'll call you tomorrow
                 with the address.

     As he gets into his car, we then:

     CUT TO: A NEWSPAPER

     The crime scene from the night before.  A shot of Karen and Ray
     Cruz as they exit the house.  A headline reads "TRIPLE MURDER"
     blah-blah-blah...

                              BUDDY (PHONE)
                 You have the paper?

     REVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the
     newspaper photograph of Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a terrific shot of her.

     INT. BUDDY'S ROOM - SAME

     Buddy looking at the same shot...

                              BUDDY
                 Outside of that.

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & BUDDY

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't say what she's doing up here,
                 but I don't think it has anything to
                 do with us.

                              BUDDY
                 She came up here on her vacation, 'cause
                 she likes shitty weather.

     Foley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center
     and pulls out a tie.

                              FOLEY
                 I think she's after Glenn.  The girl
                 still with you?

                              BUDDY
                 They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less
                 you pay for it.

                              FOLEY
                 You tell your sister about it?

                              BUDDY
                 Just hung up.

                              FOLEY
                 How long you talk to her?

                              BUDDY
                 Two hours.

                              FOLEY
                 How long were you with the girl?

                              BUDDY
                 Forty-five minutes.

                              FOLEY
                 You didn't tell your sister about
                 Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna
                 go through that again.

                              BUDDY
                 Forget about my sister.  If Karen
                 Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked.
                 Tomorrow night at the fights we all
                 get picked up.

                              FOLEY
                 Let's drive by where we're meeting and
                 have a look.  Maybe take a look at
                 Ripley's place while we're at it.

     Foley hangs up.  He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie.

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 I guess next time I see you, you'll be
                 wearing a suit and tie...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - DAY

     Foley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a
     jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of A GUARD, gathers up
     his belongings.  He's going home.

                              FOLEY
                 I still haven't made up my mind yet.

                              RIPLEY
                 What's to think about?

                              FOLEY
                 You goin' right back to work?

                              RIPLEY
                 First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year,
                 study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz...
                 then come back, maybe take some tennis
                 lessons.

     He tears a picture off the wall...

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here...
                      (hands it to Foley)
                 Something to remember me by.

     Foley stares at the photograph of sea life.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 It's not the real thing, but it's still
                 nice to look at.

     Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 See you on the outside, Jack.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in
     the overall effect.

                              FOLEY
                      (smiles)
                 Hi!  I just broke outta jail!

     His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at
     the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside,
     grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone...

                              VOICE (PHONE)
                 Atheneum Hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen Sisco, please.

                              VOICE
                      (pause, then)
                 I'm sorry, but there's no one by that
                 name registered.

                              FOLEY
                 Thank you.

     He dials the next number...

                              VOICE
                 Best Western...

     EXT. MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Red brick, showing its age.  Karen rings the doorbell and then
     waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy
     coat.  The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe
     holding her arms close against the cold.

                              KAREN
                 Moselle Miller?

                              MOSELLE
                 What do you want?

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 You find him, tell him the dog got run
                 over and I'm out of grocery money.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Moselle.  Who you talking to?

                              MOSELLE
                 Lady looking for Maurice.

                              MALE VOICE
                 What's she want?

                              MOSELLE
                 Hasn't said.

                              KAREN
                 That's not Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's
                 talking on the phone.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Ask what she want with him?

                              MOSELLE
                 You ask her.  Maurice's business is
                 none of my business.

     Sounding tired or bored.  She turns from the door and walks
     into the living room.  Karen steps inside, pushes the door
     closed and steps into the foyer.

                              MALE VOICE
                 How do I know?

     Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and
     sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on
     the phone...

                              KENNETH
                 The State, huh.  Who's fighting?

     Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa
     lighting a cigarette.

                              MOSELLE
                 You like to sit down?

                              KAREN
                 Thanks.

     Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray
     daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the
     fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm looking for a friend of mine I think
                 Maurice knows.

                              MOSELLE
                 You not with probation, one of those?

                              KAREN
                 No.

                              MOSELLE
                 You a lawyer?

                              KAREN
                      (smiles)
                 No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him.
                 Glenn Michaels?

     Moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke.

                              MOSELLE
                 Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed here last November.

                              MOSELLE
                 Here?  In this house?

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed with Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 Well, he ain't even here that much.  I
                 like to know where he goes, but at the
                 same time I don't want to know, you
                 understand?

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Your dog was killed?

                              MOSELLE
                 Got run over by a car.

                              KAREN
                 What did you call it?

     Moselle looks at the couch, where a MANGLED FRISBEE sits.

                              MOSELLE
                 Was a she, name Tuffy.

                              KAREN
                      (nods, then)
                 Where do you think I might find Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 I don't know -- the gym, the fights.
                 I know he don't miss the fights.  Having
                 some tomorrow night at the State
                 Theater.  He use to take me.

                              KAREN
                 The State Theater?

                              VOICE
                 What you want with Maurice?

     Karen turns, sees Kenneth standing in the arched entrance from
     the foyer.

                              MOSELLE
                 She looking for a man name of Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 Did I ask you?  Go on out of here.  Do
                 something with yourself.

     He waits until Moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away
     from them through the dining room.  Karen watches him come toward
     her now in kind of an easy strut.  She indicates the scar over
     his eye...

                              KAREN
                 You're a fighter?

                              KENNETH
                 How you know that?

                              KAREN
                 I can tell.

                              KENNETH
                 I was...

     He moves his head in what might be a feint.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Till I got my retina detached two time.

     He's standing so close to her, Karen has to look up at him.

                              KAREN
                 What'd you fight, middleweight?

                              KENNETH
                 Light to super-middleweight, as my
                 body developed.  You go about what,
                 bantam?

                              KAREN
                 Flyweight.

                              KENNETH
                 You know your divisions.  You like the
                 fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah,
                 I bet you do.
                      (moves closer)
                 Like to get down and tussle a little
                 bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she
                 got run over, we use to get down on
                 the floor and tussle.  I say to her,
                 "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat
                 for you."  And I give Tuffy what every
                 dog love best.  You know what that is?
                 A bone.
                      (real close)
                 I can give you a bone, too, girl.

                              KAREN
                 You're not my type.

                              KENNETH
                 Don't matter.  I let the monster out,
                 you gonna do what it wants.

                              KAREN
                 Just a minute.

     Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.

                              KENNETH
                 Bring your own rubbers with you?

     Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip
     on a golf club.  Kenneth grins at her...

                              KENNETHN (CONT'D)
                 What else you have in there, mace?
                 Have a whistle, different kinds of
                 female-protection shit?

     Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face.

                              KAREN
                 I have to go, Kenneth.

     She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's
     like a golf club grip.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?

     She steps aside and brushes past him.  He grabs her left wrist...

                              KENNETH
                 We gonna tussle first.

     Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots
     out of the grip.  She pulls an arm's length away from him and
     chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking
     away...

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 God damn...

     He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that
     when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of
     his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 What's wrong with you?

                              KAREN
                 You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

     And she walks out.  She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer.
     Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and
     comes out with a business card.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wrote my hotel number on there -- in
                 case you run into Glenn.

     Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.  Karen smiles
     at her and walks out the door.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - DAY

     It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     Buddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see
     the house.

                              BUDDY
                 Now that's a really big house.

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost
                 looks like a prison.

                              BUDDY
                 No doubt the man's got some big-ass
                 security system.

                              FOLEY
                 Time comes, we knock on the door.  See
                 if he wants to talk about old times.
                 Go in the easy way.

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we
                 got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole
                 with us?

                              FOLEY
                 Who says anybody's gonna be with us?
                 I say we go to the fights tomorrow,
                 find out what the Snoop's big plan is,
                 then go in ahead of those guys --
                 alone.

                              BUDDY
                 Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while
                 we're off livin' the good life.

                              FOLEY
                 Tell me something, Buddy.  You know
                 anyone who's actually done one last
                 big score and gone to live the good
                 life?  Cause it occurred to me that
                 everyone talks about doing it, but I
                 don't know anyone who's actually gone
                 and done it.  Do you?

                              BUDDY
                      (beat)
                 What about that D.B. Cooper guy?

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I mean, they don't know for sure he's
                 dead.
                      (then)
                 Look, there's always a chance we'll
                 walk out've there with nothing.  I say
                 let fate decide.

                              FOLEY
                 Let fate decide?  What're you, the
                 fuckin' Dali Lama now?

                              BUDDY
                 My sister believes in fate, but not
                 hell.  That's why she stopped praying
                 for the lost souls since you don't
                 hear that much about purgatory anymore.
                 But every day she asks her boss to
                 pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think,
                 you think there's a hell, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional
                 Institution and I'm sure as shit not
                 going back there or any place like it.

                              BUDDY
                 You might not have a choice.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They put a gun on you, you'll go back.

                              FOLEY
                 They put a gun on you, you still have
                 a choice, don't you?

     Foley turns back to the house.  And now we hear...

                              MR. HEARN (VO)
                 I think you're gonna fit right in...

     INT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY

     The personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a
     grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty
     suit and tie.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long
                 discussion about your role in the
                 company and it was his feeling that
                 you would be happiest working down
                 here in Miami.  How's that sound to
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 Great.

     Mr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley...

                              MR. HEARN
                 You're about a 42 long, right?

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     But Mr. Hearn walks out without answering.  Foley looks at the
     desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the-
     bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar.

     Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with
     it.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Okay.  Let's see how she fits.

     Foley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what
     looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm.

                              FOLEY
                 What is this?

                              MR. HEARN
                 Your uniform.

                              FOLEY
                 My what?

     Mr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one
     arm.  Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Are you kidding me?

     RICHARD RIPLEY'S OFFICE

     View.  Wet bar.  Huge fucking aquarium.

                              RECEPTIONIST (OS)
                 Sir, you can't go in there...

     Ripley looks up from his desk as Foley steps in, the receptionist
     right behind him now.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack?  Whoa-- what's the problem?
                 Take it easy, let's talk...

     Meanwhile, Ripley pushes a PANIC BUTTON beneath his desk...

                              FOLEY
                 A security guard?  Are you fucking
                 kidding me?

     Ripley considers Foley a moment, then...

                              RIPLEY
                 You know, I wasn't sure you'd show up.
                 But I was pretty sure that, if you
                 did, you'd throw the job in my face.
                      (then)
                 Understand something, Jack.  Up to
                 this point, everything you've done
                 with your life means absolutely nothing
                 in the real world.  Less than nothing.

     Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're a bank robber.  This is not a
                 marketable skill.  There are no old
                 bank robbers out in the world living
                 on pensions.  You know this.  That's
                 why you're here right now.
                 
     Still Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at
                 a lousy wage.  You think you're better
                 than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me
                 that you're really willing to change
                 and we'll talk about something better.
                 A lot better.  But first, Jack, you
                 gotta earn it.

                              FOLEY
                 How, Dick?  The way you earned it?  By
                 marrying some rich broad owns the
                 company, selling it off a piece at a
                 time, then divorcing her?  What is
                 this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by
                 the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in
                 prison, guy like you, place like that,
                 you were ice cream for freaks.  You
                 were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and
                 a dozen other guys coulda bled you
                 till you had nothing.  Till you were
                 nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll
                 pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a
                 fuckin stool all day saying "sign in
                 here please" or "hey, pal, you can't
                 park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do
                 it.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I
                 misjudged you.

     Two massive SECURITY GUARDS appear in the doorway...

                              FOLEY
                 Hey, what job he promise you guys?

                              GUARD
                 There's two ways we can do this.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  What are they?

                              RIPLEY
                 Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down
                 now.  Haven't we, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally
                 "relaxed..."

     And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH) and wings
     it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S BUILDING - FLORIDA - DAY

     As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two
     guards.  He picks himself up.  He kicks at the guards, who wave
     him off, go back inside.

     Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees...

     THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     The one from the opening.  Foley looks at it a moment, then
     calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he
     starts across the street...

                                                             CUT TO:

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As Buddy pulls away from the house, Foley pulls out the clipping of
     Karen he tore out of the morning paper.  He's written the name 
     "WESTIN" on it.

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, I gotta get some better shoes,
                 few other things before tomorrow.  Why
                 don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen,
                 we'll hook up later?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, and I better call my sister.

     CUT TO: THE SNOWSTORM

     It's really coming down.  We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're
     looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of
     the Westin.

     A table of three young EXECUTIVE-LOOKING GUYS in suits are
     laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a WAITRESS to
     an adjacent table.

                              KAREN
                 Jack Daniel's, please, water on the
                 side.

     She turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast
     sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above
     the city, down there somewhere.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY'S VOICE
                 Celeste, do us again, please, and put
                 the lady's drink on our bill.

     She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling,
     pleasant-looking guys in dark suits.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks anyway.

                              WAITRESS
                      (drifting over)
                 They want to buy you a drink.

                              KAREN
                 I get that.  Tell them I'd rather pay
                 for my own.

     She then watches the three guys looking at the waitress
     delivering the message.  Then they look at Karen.  She gives
     them a shrug, turns to watch the snow.  Her drink arrives.  She
     takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over...

                              EXECUTIVE GUY
                 Excuse me.  My associates and I made a
                 bet on what you do for a living.

     She glances at the table, the other two watching.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY (CONT'D)
                 And I won.  Hi, I'm Philip.

                              KAREN
                 If it's okay with you, Philip, I'd
                 like to just have a quiet drink and
                 leave.  Okay?

                              PHILIP
                 Don't you want to know what I guessed?
                 How I know what you do for a living?

                              KAREN
                 Tell you the truth, I'm not even mildly
                 curious.  Really, I don't want to be
                 rude, Philip, I'd just like to be left
                 alone.

     She turns back to the snowstorm.  She sees his reflection turn
     and leave.  A moment later, the next one appears at the table.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2
                 I think I know why you're depressed --
                 if I may offer an observation.

     She just looks at him.  So sure of himself.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2 (CONT'D)
                 I have a hunch you're the new sales
                 rep and your customer isn't exactly
                 knocked out by the idea of a young
                 lady, even one as stunning as you,
                 handling the account.  Am I close?
                 Hi, I'm Andy.

     She says nothing to him.

                              ANDY
                 We're ad guys.  We flew in from New
                 York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker
                 Distillery, present this test-market
                 campaign for their new margarita mix.
                 What we do, we show this guy who looks
                 like a Mexican bandido, you know, with
                 the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts--

                              KAREN
                 Andy?  Really.  Who gives a shit?

     He gives her a sympathetic expression.

                              ANDY
                 Want to tell me what happened?

                              KAREN
                 Beat it, will you?

     She stares at the guy until he turns away.  She sips her drink,
     stares once more out at the blizzard.  After a few moments,
     another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.

                              VOICE
                 Can I buy you a drink?

     Boom.  Not one of the executive guys.  She stares at the
     reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK
     FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, I'd love one.
                      (then)
                 Would you like to sit down?

     He pulls the chair out, looking at her.  The three guys at the
     other table now staring as he sits down.  Foley offers his
     hand...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm Gary.

     She hesitates, then shakes his hand...

                              KAREN
                 I'm Celeste.

     She smiles with him.  When she lowers her hand to the table,
     his hand comes down to cover hers.  She watches his expression
     as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers,
     and lays her hand on his.  The tips of her fingers brush his
     knuckles, lightly back and forth.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It takes hours to get a drink around
                 here.  There's only one waitress.

                              FOLEY
                 I can go to the bar.

                              KAREN
                 Don't leave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Those guys bother you?

                              KAREN
                 No, they're all right.  I meant, you
                 just got here.

     She picks up her drink and places it in front of him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Help yourself.

     She watches him take a sip, smack his lips.

                              FOLEY
                 You like bourbon?

                              KAREN
                 Love it.

                              FOLEY
                      (passes the glass
                       back)
                 Well, we got that out of the way.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for
                 a living?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call
                 on a customer and they gave me a hard
                 time because I'm a girl.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that how you think of yourself?

                              KAREN
                 What, as a sales rep?

                              FOLEY
                 A girl.

                              KAREN
                 I don't have a problem with it.

                              FOLEY
                 I like your hair.  And that suit.

                              KAREN
                 I had one just like it -- well, it was
                 the same idea, but I had to get rid of
                 it.

                              FOLEY
                 You did?

                              KAREN
                 It smelled.

                              FOLEY
                 Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?

                              KAREN
                 No.
                      (then)
                 What do you do for a living, Gary?

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 How far do we go with this?

     This stops her, throws her off balance.

                              KAREN
                 Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think it works if we're somebody
                 else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and
                 Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about
                 anything?

                              KAREN
                 It's your game.  I've never played
                 this before.

                              FOLEY
                 It's not a game.  Something you play.

                              KAREN
                 Well, does it make sense to you?

                              FOLEY
                 It doesn't have to, it's something
                 that happens.  It's like seeing a person
                 you never saw before -- you could be
                 passing on the street -- you look at
                 each other and for a few seconds,
                 there's a kind of recognition.  Like
                 you both know something.  But then the
                 next moment the person's gone, and
                 it's too late to do anything about it,
                 but you remember it because it was
                 right there and you let it go, and you
                 think, "What if I had stopped and said
                 something?"  It might happen only a
                 few times in your life.

                              KAREN
                 Or once.

     They look at each other a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 Why don't we get out of here.

     They both get up.  The ad guys at the table watch as she follows
     Foley to the elevator.  Karen winks at them.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     As they ride down to Karen's room.  She looks at him, looks
     away.  The doors open and they exit.

     INT. HER HOTEL SUITE

     As he follows her in.  She walks to the bar, fixes them each a
     drink.  He checks out the room, takes in her view.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you find me?

     He comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her
     picture and shows it to her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Oh, God...

                              FOLEY
                 I called your room from downstairs.

                              KAREN
                 If I had answered, what were you gonna
                 say?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, I'd say who I was and do you
                 remember me and ask if you'd like to
                 meet for a drink.

                              KAREN
                 If I remembered you.  I came looking
                 for you.  I would've said sure, let's
                 do it.  But for all you knew I could
                 show up with a SWAT team.  Why would
                 you trust me?

                              FOLEY
                 It would be worth the risk.

     She looks at him, touches his face with her hand...

                              KAREN
                 You like taking risks.

                              FOLEY
                 So do you.

     He kisses her now, puts his arms around her.

                              KAREN
                 What's the hurry, Jack?  You have to
                 be somewhere?

     She hands him his drink.  They both drink, then...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Sooner or later...

     She stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You really wear that suit.

                              FOLEY
                 That's not what you were about to say.

     She shrugs, lets it go.  He puts down his drink, kisses her.
     She lets him, then moves to the couch.

                              KAREN
                 Remember how talkative you were?  In
                 the trunk?  Adele said you do that
                 when you're nervous.

                              FOLEY
                 She did, huh.

                              KAREN
                 You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but in a nice way.

     He sits down and they kiss again.  This time she peels his jacket
     off.  He does the same with hers.  He's starting to unbutton
     her blouse when--

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                      (unbuttoning)
                 I might've smelled like a sewer, but
                 you could tell I was a gentleman.
                 They say John Dillinger was a pretty
                 nice guy.

                              KAREN
                 He killed a police officer.

     He stops.  Looks at her.

                              FOLEY
                 I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop
                 fell as Dillinger was aiming at his
                 leg and got him through the heart.

                              KAREN
                 You believe that?

                              FOLEY
                 Why not?

     She looks at him, decides to get off this subject.  Anyway he's
     finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands
     inside her shirt.  She closes her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 You know that Sig .380 you took was my
                 favourite.  My father gave it to me.

     As he kisses her on the neck.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 What were you gonna do with me?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I hadn't worked that
                 part out yet.  All I knew was that I
                 liked you, and I didn't want to leave
                 you there, never see you again.

                              KAREN
                 You waved to me in the elevator.

     She's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't sure you caught that.

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking
                 of you by then, a lot, wondering what
                 it would be like if we did meet.  Like
                 if we could take a time-out...

                              FOLEY
                 Really?  I was thinking the same thing.
                 If we could call time and get together
                 for a while.

     They look at each other a moment.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You know I saw you on the street.

                              KAREN
                 Where?

                              FOLEY
                 Outside Adele's.

     He starts to kiss her again, but--

                              KAREN
                 You were going to see her?

                              FOLEY
                 To warn her about Chino.

                              KAREN
                 So she did help you?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think we should get into that.

                              KAREN
                 No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't
                 ask if he's with you or what you're
                 doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've
                 run into Glenn Michaels yet.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare
                 me.

     And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.

                              KAREN
                 Come on.

     He gets up and she leads him across the room...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to
     take off his pants.

                              KAREN
                 Are you gonna leave your tie on?

     He looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she
     gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him,
     standing close to help him with the tie...

                              FOLEY
                 My God, look at you.

     When her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck
     again and then as she turns off the light...

     She kisses him.  He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with
     him, the only light now coming from the sitting room.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You having fun?

     She smiles and then they start to make love as we then...

     FADE OUT.

     CUT TO: KAREN

     Eyes open, serious now.

     REVEAL

     She's lying in Jack's arms.  She looks at him a moment, then
     moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.

                              FOLEY
                 You coming back?

                              KAREN
                 I'm just going to the bathroom.

     She gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the
     door.  Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     She comes in.  Looks at herself in the mirror.  Suddenly
     feels self-conscious.  She grabs a bathrobe off the door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the
     ceiling.  She comes out again and stands looking down at him.

                              KAREN
                 I want you to know something.  I wasn't
                 looking for just a fuck, if that's
                 what you're thinking.

                              FOLEY
                 Why are you mad?

                              KAREN
                 Or I did it for some kind of kinky
                 thrill.  Score with a bank robber the
                 way some women go for rough trade.

                              FOLEY
                 What about my motive?  Now I can say I
                 fucked a US Marshal.  You think I
                 will?

                              KAREN
                 I don't know.

     He raises the covers, but she just stands there.

                              FOLEY
                 I know of a guy he goes in the bank
                 holding a bottle he says is
                 nitroglycerin.  He scores some cash
                 off a teller, he's on his way out when
                 he drops the bottle.  It shatters on
                 the tile floor, he slips in the stuff,
                 cracks his head and they've got him.
                 The nitro was canola oil.  I know more
                 fucked-up bank robbers than ones that
                 know what they're doing.  I doubt one
                 in ten can tell a dye pack when he
                 sees one.  Most bank robbers are fucking
                 morons.  To go to bed with a bank robber
                 for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd
                 have to be as dumb as they are.  I
                 know you're not dumb, so why would I
                 think that?  Why would you think I
                 might think that?

     She comes over and sits down on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 You're not dumb.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know about that.  You can't do
                 three falls and think you have much of
                 a brain.

     They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him.  He senses
     this, looks at her...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You getting serious on me now?

                              KAREN
                 I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know
                 what's gonna happen.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 You know.

     And he kisses her.

     EXT. DETROIT - DAY

     The sun is out.  The snow has stopped falling.  A white blanket
     covers everything.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

     Karen opens her eyes, wakes up.  She closes them again, lies
     on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.  Then...

                              KAREN
                 Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.

     She opens her eyes and rolls on to her back.  She turns her head:
     Foley's gone.  She gets out of bed.

     INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Karen comes into the room tying her robe.  She looks at the
     coffee table where...

     Something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and
     the ice bucket.  She picks it up and slowly unfolds the "gift"
     from Foley:  Her Sig-Sauer .38.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his
     underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room-
     service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by.

                              BUDDY
                 It took you, what, seven hours to buy
                 a pair of shoes?

                              FOLEY
                 I saw Karen Sisco.

     Buddy turns to him.

                              BUDDY
                 And she saw you?

                              FOLEY
                 Yes, she did.

                              BUDDY
                 So how's that work, a wanted felon
                 socializing with a U.S. Marshal?

                              FOLEY
                 You know how I felt about her.

                              BUDDY
                 Did you give her a jump?  If you did I
                 might begin to understand where your
                 head's at.

                              FOLEY
                 It wasn't about getting laid.  I just
                 wanted to know what might've happened
                 if things were different.

                              BUDDY
                 You find out?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I did.

     Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee.

                              BUDDY
                 So what's that mean?  That you're
                 disappointed by what you found or you're
                 sorry you robbed all those banks?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of
     glasses.  She reaches for the phone, dials.  A moment later, we
     hear MARSHALL SISCO'S ANSWERING MACHINE and she hangs up.

     INT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT

     A ring set up on stage.  Men hang out on the side.  Where movie
     seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of
     them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through
     the theatre to the bar.  Rap music booms out of speakers as
     fighters are announced.

     Everyone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob
     who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude
     black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along
     the apron of the stage.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, stick and jab!

     White Boy Bob throws down a beer and gives Glenn's shoulder a jab.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You drink like a girl.

     White Boy looks around to see if there are any other morons
     sitting nearby who think it's funny.  Kenneth comes through for
     his pal and laughs.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     As Karen walks through the bar, pauses as she sees Glenn sitting
     with White Boy and Kenneth.  She steps back into the shadows as
     Glenn glances anxiously about.

     ON GLENN

     As he pushes his chair back.

                              GLENN
                 I got to go take a piss.

     He hesitates, sees the car keys on the table in front of White
     Boy Bob.  But before he can grab them...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 What're you telling us for?  You want
                 somebody to hold your little pecker?

     Glenn gets up, sees his coat on the back of the chair, but knows
     he can't take it with him.  He walks away from the table.

     EXT. STATE THEATER - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

     Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot.
     Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME TIME

     Glenn behind the wheel, half lying on his right side as he tries
     to rip open the locked glove compartment.  His head jerks around
     as Karen opens the door.  He sits up straight as she gets in
     with him.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, are you trying to steal this
                 car?

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, I don't believe it.

                              KAREN
                 Another one of those days, huh, nothing
                 seems to go right?

     He raises his empty hands.

                              GLEN
                 I don't have the keys.

                              KAREN
                 I see that.

                              GLENN
                 I mean I'm not stealing the fucking
                 car.

                              KAREN
                 You're not?

                              GLENN
                 I already stole it.  Last week or
                 whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't
                 be stealing it again, can I?

                              KAREN
                 The two guys you were with -- that
                 one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it?
                 I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that
                 didn't look like him.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?

     Karen looks at him, shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, I know your life history, who
                 your friends are, where you've been
                 and now, it looks like, where you're
                 going.  Put your hands on the wheel.

                              GLENN
                 You're gonna bust me for picking up a
                 car?

                              KAREN
                 For the car, for aiding and abetting a
                 prison escape, and conspiring to do
                 whatever you came here for.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, these guys, they're gonna be
                 out here any minute looking for me.
                 They're fucking animals.

                              KAREN
                 What's going on, Glenn?

                              GLENN
                 Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck
                 outta here.

                              KAREN
                 But I thought the whole thing was your
                 idea?

                              GLENN
                 Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but
                 these guys, man, they're into shit I
                 can't handle.

                              KAREN
                 Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?

                              GLENN
                 Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at
                 his office tomorrow, take him out to
                 his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I
                 don't give a shit what they do.

                              KAREN
                 And is Foley a part of this?

                              GLENN
                 He's supposed to be, but he hasn't
                 shown up yet, which is a good thing
                 for him.

                              KAREN
                 Why's that?

                              GLENN
                 Maurice is gonna kill him, try and
                 collect the reward.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 But you say he hasn't shown up, you
                 think he backed out?

                              GLENN
                 I don't know-- he doesn't exactly
                 confide in me.

                              KAREN
                 Gee, I wonder why not.

                              GLENN
                 I'm freezing my ass off.

                              KAREN
                 You want to get out of here, run, it'll
                 warm you up.

                              GLENN
                 Really?

                              KAREN
                 But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to
                 me...

                              GLENN
                 I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I
                 believe it.  I keep thinking if you
                 hadn't driven me to federal court last
                 summer, you wouldn't even know who I
                 am.

                              KAREN
                 If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow
                 you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it
                 that way.  Go on.

     And he takes off.  She sits there another moment, then flicks
     her cigarette out the door, gets out the car.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

     Karen looks across the street at the theatre, sees people
     leaving.  A few seconds later, she steps behind a car and watches
     as Buddy and Foley pull into the lot.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     Maurice sits with White Boy and Kenneth as Foley and Buddy come
     down the aisle to their table.

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been?  You miss the big boys,
                 come in time for the walkout fights.
                 Well, shit, you may as well pull up a
                 chair.

     Foley and Buddy remain standing.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and
                 this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers.

     Foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY
                 Who's sitting here?

                              MAURICE
                 Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he
                 went to the men's about a while ago
                 and never came back.

     Foley gives Buddy a look.  White Boy Bob grins at them.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I think he must've fell in.

                              MAURICE
                 I sent these two looking for him, they
                 come back shaking their heads.

                              FOLEY
                 Well, if he left his coat and he's
                 been gone a while.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 The car's still there.  I looked.

                              MAURICE
                      (to the ring)
                 Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push
                 him off.

                              FOLEY
                 We're leaving.

                              MAURICE
                 The fuck you talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn
                 is...

     Maurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, what you worried about Glenn
                 for?  What's he know?

                              FOLEY
                 I thought everything.

     Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while
     the other one takes wild swings and misses...

                              MAURICE
                 Glenn knows everything we suppose to
                 do tomorrow.  Glenn could tell somebody
                 that, yeah, but it don't mean shit.
                 You understand?  'Cause Glenn don't
                 know I changed the plan.
                      (then)
                 It's happening tonight.

     Foley looks at Maurice now.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and
                 pick up what we need and go do it.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 You got two minutes, that's all.  Make
                 up your mind.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't asking permission.

     Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 They want to go tonight, before Glenn
                 gets in any trouble, opens his big
                 mouth.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you wanna do?

     Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You know they gonna set us up.

                              FOLEY
                 I get that feeling, yeah.

                              BUDDY
                 But you still think you can get the
                 diamonds fore they do?

     Foley looks at him a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here.
                 Right now.  I'll do the job with the
                 Snoop, meet you wherever you want and
                 give you half.

                              BUDDY
                 Half for doing what?

                              FOLEY
                 Getting me out of Glades for starters.

                              BUDDY
                 And who watches your back?

     ON MAURICE

     As he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy
     and Foley talk up at the bar.

                              MAURICE
                 Man has all that reward on his head
                 and still talks like a con in the yard.
                 You know what I'm saying?  Like he's a
                 man you don't mess with.  Yeah, well,
                 what I say to Jack Foley is buuullshit.

     EXT. MAURICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     It's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and
     Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing
     and heating company on the side.

     We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're watching from inside Karen's
     car.  She waits for the van to pull away, then follows.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Kenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel.  Buddy and Foley
     piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and
     equipment.  Maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls.

                              FOLEY
                 That what they're wearing these days
                 to break and enter?

                              MAURICE
                 Break and enter, shit.  Take it and
                 git, how it's done.  Don't waste any
                 time.  That's how you do it.

                              FOLEY
                 So you've done this before, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted
                 for it.
                      (then)
                 White Boy, tell these boys the reason
                 you went down on that burglary that
                 time.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I left my wallet in the house I robbed.

     The guy grins at them.  Foley can't believe it.

                              MAURICE
                 Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit
                 and leaves his wallet on the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm
                 very excited about tonight.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey.  You learn from doing.

     Foley and Buddy exchange looks.  Maurice turns around, a Beretta
     in his hand.  Foley looks at him.  Buddy tenses.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You know how to use one a these?

                              FOLEY
                 I've seen 'em used on TV.

     Maurice hands Foley the Beretta.  Then reaches into a bag, comes
     up with a .38 he hands to Buddy.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     As Karen tries to keep up with the van.  But with the snow and
     the way Kenneth drives, she starts to lose them.  She speeds up
     around a corner and loses control of the car.

     EXT. STREET - SAME

     As Karen's car does a 360 in the ice and snow.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Buddy and Foley are jostled about the back from Kenneth's insane
     driving.

                              BUDDY
                 Slow down.

     Kenneth grins in the mirror, punches it more.  Buddy gets out
     the .38 and touches it to the back of Kenneth's head.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Get ready to grab the wheel when I
                 shoot this asshole.

     Kenneth, his eyes freaked with speed, glares at Buddy in the
     mirror.

                              MAURICE
                 Do like he says, man.  Slow down.

     EXT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     As a pissed-off Karen gets out of her car, watches the van
     disappear.

                              KAREN
                 Shit --

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     She takes out her cellphone, punches a number, re-orients her
     car at the same time.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As the van creeps by one way, then the other, then pulls into
     the driveway.

     INT./EXT.  VAN - RIPLEY'S HOUSE

     All five of them in the back end of the van now, bumping into
     each other until Maurice lets White Boy out the rear end, leaving
     the doors open enough so he can watch.  He then racks the slide
     on a .45.

                              MAURICE
                 "An army .45 will stop all jive."
                 Huey P. said that.

                              BUDDY
                 You think he was talking about walking
                 into people's houses when he said it?

     Maurice looks at Buddy.  Buddy holds his gaze.  Then the coach
     lights on either side of the front entrance come on.

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls his mask down)
                 Get ready to go skiing.

     Now the front door opens...

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Here we go.

     We catch a glimpse of a WOMAN in the doorway, arms folded over
     her bathrobe as White Boy gives her a push and steps inside the
     house with her.

     Maurice is out of the truck and Kenneth, with a shotgun, is
     scrambling to be next.  Buddy catches him by his jacket collar
     and holds him squirming until Foley is out.

     The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge
     on Buddy, still in the truck.  Foley takes the barrel in one
     hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face.

                              FOLEY
                 Go on in the house before you get hurt.

     Kenneth puts his face up close to Foley's and stares at him
     good before going inside.  Foley turns to Buddy...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 There's still time, take me up on my
                 offer.

                              BUDDY
                 I'm not leaving you alone with these
                 assholes.

     INT. HOUSE - FOYER - SAME

     Where Maurice has the woman backed against a table.  She's in
     her forties, with thick red hair hanging free.  She looks ready
     to take a swing at whoever approaches...

                              WOMAN
                 I work here.  I'm the maid.

     Kenneth reaches out, opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy
     bra and low-cut panties before she slaps him away.

                              WOMAN/MAID
                 Fuck off.

                              KENNETH
                 Hey, shit, we're gonna have a party.

                              MAURICE
                 Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?

                              MAID
                 I told you, he isn't here.

                              MAURICE
                 Out for the evening?

                              MAID
                 He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 When's he due back?

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what difference does it
                 make?  You want to wait for him?

                              MAID
                 Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
                 Christmas to Easter.

                              MAURICE
                 You here all by yourself?

                              MAID
                      (beat)
                 That's right, just me.

     Foley catches the hesitation, glances at Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his
                 valuables in.

                              MAID
                 I don't have any idea.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go upstairs, have a look at the
                 man's bedroom.  All right now, you and
                 Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here.
                 Look at the wall behind any pictures
                 hanging on it.  Look at the walls in
                 the closets.  The man has a safe, it's
                 gonna be up there somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                 How about his place in Florida?  If
                 you'd called, we could've checked his
                 walls down there before we left.  That
                 is, if you'd checked to see where he
                 was.  You follow me?

     Maurice gives him a look, pulls the maid up the stairs.  Kenneth
     and White Boy Bob follow...

                              MAURICE
                 You set off any kind of alarm and you're
                 a dead Hazel.  Understand?

     Kenneth puts his arm around the maid.

                              KENNETH
                 What's you name, mama?

     He hooks a finger in the waist of her panties, pulls on the
     elastic, is about to look in there when Maurice backhands him
     across the face.

                              MAURICE
                 First money, then pussy.

     Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head.

                              FOLEY
                 You ever wear one of these?

                              BUDDY
                 I don't ski.

                              FOLEY
                 Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a
                 look around.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Karen on the phone... snow falling all around her.

                              RAYMOND CRUZ (PHONE)
                 I'll send a unit over there, see if
                 there's anything going on.

                              KAREN
                 Tell me where Ripley's house is.  I'll
                 meet them there.

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 Karen, you gonna promise me you're not
                 gonna go in, do anything stupid till I
                 get there...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

     Full of fat, cushy chairs and a sofa, everything white or black,
     a wet bar, a big TV, CD player.  Buddy moves into the doorway,
     peers inside.

     Kenneth is trying to find a radio station while Maurice and
     White Boy Bob ransack the place.  White Boy Bob checks under
     the mattress...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hey--

     Maurice and Kenneth look over expectantly.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 I found a rubber.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no
                 diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.

     Maurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Where's Foley?

                              BUDDY
                 Checkin' the other rooms, like you
                 said.

                              MAURICE
                      (to White Boy)
                 Go keep an eye on him.

     White Boy Bob slips out of the room.  Maurice turns to Kenneth,
     who's still playing with the stereo.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD.

                              KENNETH
                      (looking them over)
                 I don't recognize none of these bands.

                              MAURICE
                 Just pick one, put it on.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob watches from the end of the hall as Foley peers
     into each of the bedrooms.  Foley sees a back staircase and
     starts down.  A moment later White Boy Bob follows.

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes down the stairs.  No sign of Foley.  White
     Boy starts down one hallway, then turns back.  Now he's lost.
     He opens a door, starts to walk into a closet, then backs out.
     He goes down the hall, turns into...

     THE KITCHEN - SAME

     Where White Boy Bob enters, calls out tentatively.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Uh, Foley?

     He takes in the huge room, the massive sub-zero refrigerator.
     He moves to the freezer, opens it, takes in the FROZEN STEAKS.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Cool.

     INT. HALLWAY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME 

     As Foley quietly moves to the doorway, peers into the kitchen,
     watches White Boy Bob starts going through the freezer, taking
     out steaks and stacking them up on the counter.  Foley shakes
     his head and moves on.

     INT. LIBRARY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME

     Dark.  As Foley steps into the doorway, we BOOM DOWN to reveal
     a LIGHTED AQUARIUM in f.g.  He comes into the room, sits down
     in an armchair beside the fish tank.

     He leans close to the glass, stares at the fish a moment.  He
     sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room,
     sees how the phone cord disappears underneath.

                              FOLEY
                 They cut the lines, Richard.

     Silence.  The door opens and we see a terrified Richard Ripley
     sitting on top of a toilet, the phone in his lap.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley?  That you?

                              FOLEY
                 How are you, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what the hell are you
                 doing here?  What's going on?  Who's
                 upstairs?

                              FOLEY
                 Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

                              RIPLEY
                 Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.

     Ripley moves to the doorway.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Have they got Midge up there?

                              FOLEY
                 What kinda man lets a woman answer the
                 door, this time a night?

                              RIPLEY
                 We thought it might be her husband.
                 Sometimes he comes and checks up on
                 her.  She told him I was down in
                 Florida.

                              FOLEY
                 A minute or two, you're gonna wish you
                 were.

     Ripley looks at him.  Foley pats the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you come on over here, sit
                 down, Richard, have a look at your
                 fish.

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - ROAD - SAME

     As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     The music ON LOUD (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi).  Buddy stands
     in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he
     takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look
     them over.  He tries on a coat, turns to the maid.

                              MAURICE
                 How do I look, mama?

                              MAID
                 Like a fag.

     Maurice smiles at her, goes back into the closet.  Kenneth stares
     at the maid, nodding slowly.

                              KENNETH
                 I think she like to tussle with me.
                 Get boned a way she gonna remember.

     She looks to the doorway, where Buddy now starts to take a step
     into the room, when Maurice comes out of the closet...

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Motherfucker!

     He sticks his head out of the closet.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I found the safe.

     Buddy backs out of the room.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen drives slowly past the house.  White Boy Bob emerges
     with an armload of steaks and sets them on the front steps.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy!  Get your ass up here!

     White Boy Bob hurries back into the house.

     INT. RIPLEY'S LIBRARY - SAME

     Ripley sits on the couch across from Foley.  He keeps looking
     up at the ceiling.

                              RIPLEY
                 What do you want from me, Jack?  Name
                 it.  You want money?

                              FOLEY
                 You gonna write me a check?

                              RIPLEY
                 We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a
                 withdrawal.

     Foley just looks at him.  Buddy sticks his head in the room.

                              BUDDY
                 They found the safe.

                              FOLEY
                 You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, hi.  Nice house.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thank you.

     INT. BEDROOM - CLOSET DOORWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes in as Kenneth and Maurice are getting ready
     to blast the safe with the shotgun and pistol.

                              MAURICE
                 We gonna open up this fucker...

     Maurice and his boys open fire on the safe.  The maid covers up
     as bullets begin ricocheting all over the room.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Jesus...!

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     Karen sees the muzzle flashes in the upstairs window and quickly
     gets out of the car.

     INT. STUDY - SAME

     As Buddy and Ripley look up.

                              RIPLEY
                      (gets up)
                 Good God... they're shooting Midge!

                              FOLEY
                      (pushes him down)
                 Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open
                 the safe, not your maid.

     INT. BEDROOM

     As Maurice, Kenneth and White Boy Bob get ready to fire again.

                              MAURICE
                 A'ight, this time we gotta get the
                 motherfuckin' trajectory right...
                      (pause)
                 Okay, on three:  One... Two...

                              MAID
                 The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

     They all turn to look at her, guns still pointing at the safe.

                              MAID (CONT'D)
                 Richard's birthday.

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen cautiously makes her way towards the front door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     As Maurice finally gets the safe open.  They all anxiously peer
     inside.  Maurice narrows his eyes, reaches in, pulls out one of
     three toupees.  He stares at it.

                              MAURICE
                 ...the fuck is this...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Are they dead?

     He looks at White Boy Bob...

                              MAURICE
                 Go find Foley.  NOW!

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Foley leans forward in the chair now...

                              RIPLEY
                 I can't believe you're still angry
                 with me, Jack, after all this time.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm not angry, Richard.
                      (staring at the tank)
                 In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing
                 is, I can't tell if it's the fish
                 that're cooling me out or all those
                 uncut diamonds on the bottom of the
                 tank there.

     Ripley sags, closes his eyes.

                              BUDDY
                 Damn--

     And now Buddy takes a closer look and now we, too, see that
     strewn about the bottom of the aquarium are dozens of uncut
     diamonds of various sizes.

                              FOLEY
                 Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about
                 five million worth in there, wouldn't
                 you say, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Five point two.

                              BUDDY
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              FOLEY
                 They sure do.

     He gets up, looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Go get a bag.

     Foley turns to Richard as Buddy comes back into the room with a
     plastic bag, starts reaching into the tank.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I were you, I'd get up and run.

                              RIPLEY
                 I'm not leaving Midge.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're
                 gonna kill you.

                              RIPLEY
                 If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I love her, Jack.

     Foley looks at Buddy.  Now what?

                              BUDDY
                 C'mon.

     Foley just looks at Ripley, who doesn't move.

                              FOLEY
                 Good luck, Richard.

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Someone down here?

     Buddy and Foley slip out the other door, down the hall, just as
     Maurice walks in, some of Ripley's clothes over his arm.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.

                              RIPLEY
                 Are those my suits?

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been hiding, Dick?

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     A now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley
     and Buddy emerge from the house.

     AT THE VAN

     As Buddy leans under the dash.  Foley looks up at the house
     where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear
     the faint pumping of the music.  We hear the VAN START.

                              BUDDY
                 Okay.

     Buddy straightens up, looks at Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Come on.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

                              BUDDY
                 What?

                              FOLEY
                 They're gonna rape the maid, aren't
                 they.

                              BUDDY
                 From the looks of those boys, the
                 Ripper too.

                              FOLEY
                 And then they'll kill 'em.

                              BUDDY
                 At least.

     Foley looks at the diamonds in the bag.

                              FOLEY
                 We made it, didn't we?

                              BUDDY
                 All you gotta do is get in.

     Again Foley looks at the diamonds, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm going back inside.

                              BUDDY
                 I'll go with you.

     Foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it...

                              FOLEY
                 No, you dump the van, meet me at the
                 airport.
                 I'll take one of Ripley's cars.

                              BUDDY
                 Jack --

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about
                 to go down, you'll be on the phone
                 with your sister for a month.  Let me
                 do this part alone.

     Buddy just looks at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I'm saying this isn't your problem.
                 Far as I'm concerned, we're square.

     Foley turns to go.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey...

     Buddy hands him his gun.  Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back
     of his pants, and then turns back to the house.

                              FOLEY
                 Now get outta here.

     KAREN
     
     As she watches Foley go back inside.  A moment later, the van
     pulls out of the driveway.  Karen makes a decision, starts for
     the side of the house...

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE - THE FOYER - SAME

     Foley enters and we hear the maid scream.  Foley starts up
     the stairs.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY

     Maurice and White Boy Bob both have their guns to Ripley's head.

                              RIPLEY
                      (hears the scream)
                 Midge.

                              MAURICE
                 Forget about her.  Tell me where the
                 money's at.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley's got it.

                              MAURICE
                 Where the fuck is Foley?

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME

     Foley comes up the stairs, heads for Ripley's bedroom.  The
     door is closed now...

                              FOLEY
                 Midge?

     He steps to one side, is about to reach for the knob when
     suddenly the DOOR IS BLASTED OFF ITS HINGES.

     INT. KITCHEN (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME TIME

     Karen comes through the door, hears the gunshot, stops cold.

     INT. HALLWAY (UPSTAIRS) - SAME

     As Foley steps into the doorway and we see Kenneth and the maid
     bare, both sitting up in bed, Kenneth racking the shotgun, the
     maid turning away from him, gathering the covers that hang off
     her side of the bed...

     ...and coming around to throw them like a net at Kenneth as the
     shotgun goes off and the covers catch fire as Foley pumps one
     two three shots into Kenneth somewhere under there.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Ripley tries to get away...

                              RIPLEY
                 Midge!

     Maurice grabs him by the collar, spins him around and whips him
     across the face with his gun.  He and White Boy Bob then both
     hit Ripley on the head until he goes down and stays down.

                              MAURICE
                      (to WBB)
                 You take the front stairs, I'll take
                 the back.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As the maid jumps up and drags the burning covers from the bed
     and sees Kenneth now, the bullet holes in his chest, staring
     blankly back at him.  She then looks at Foley.

                              MAID
                      (cold)
                 Where's Dick?

                              FOLEY
                 Downstairs.
                      (then)
                 But wait here.  There's two more.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley starts out of the room and immediately hears...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hold it, asshole!

     Foley sees White Boy Bob at the bottom of the stairs.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Drop the gun.

     Nowhere to go, Foley has to comply.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Now stay right there.  Don't move.

     White Boy Bob starts to jog up the stairs two at a time, all
     the while keeping his eyes fixed on Foley.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Maurice!  I got Foley!

     INT. RIPLEY'S BACK STAIRCASE - SAME

     As Maurice starts up the backstairs...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Maurice!  Up here!

     ...and a moment later, Karen comes out of the kitchen into the
     downstairs hallway -- just missing each other.

     INT. STAIRCASE - SAME

     As White Boy Bob gets maybe half way up when he catches a toe
     on one of the risers and pitches forward.  Stupidly, he tries
     to break his fall with the elbow of his gun hand and ends up
     jamming his chin down onto the muzzle of his gun which,
     unfortunately for him, goes off, firing a bullet through his
     head and killing him instantly.

     To say the least, Foley is stunned by this freak accident.  He
     stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 You learn from doing.

     Foley bends down to pick up his gun and we see MAURICE COMING
     UP THE BACK STAIRCASE, his gun raised, and now firing away...

     Foley is forced to jump back behind a pillar as Maurice keeps
     firing at him, shots ricocheting off the pillar, the railing,
     the wall...

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Karen hugs the wall at the sound of gunshots, sees Ripley
     lying on the floor of the study...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As we hear CLICK as the breech opens on Maurice's now empty .45
     And now Foley steps out from behind the pillar and calmly bends
     down, picks up his gun, Maurice still walking forward...

                              MAURICE
                 Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?

                              FOLEY
                 Not until recently.

                              MAURICE
                      (still coming)
                 Nervous?

                              FOLEY
                 A little.

                              MAURICE
                      (getting close)
                 This kind of setup, you don't have any
                 idea what the fuck you're doing -- do
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 You're right.  So why take a chance--

     Foley pulls the trigger.  CLICK.  Maurice hesitates, surprised
     that Foley would pull the trigger, then the two of them at the
     same time rush each other, begin a messy mano a mano, now using
     their spent guns as bludgeons.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Karen carefully comes into the room, Ripley lets out a low
     GROAN.  She's bending down to check him when HER PHONE RINGS.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley and Maurice grapple on the floor near the head of the
     stairs.

     INT. STUDY - SAME

     As Karen answers her phone, checks Ripley...

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 We're a few minutes away.  Just sit
                 tight, stay outta the house till we
                 get there, understand?

                              KAREN
                 Oh-kay...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.  Maurice rolls
     down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as...
     
     Foley gets up, runs back to the bedroom.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins
     searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over
     the body, etc) with no success...

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk
     of White Boy Bob.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley, exasperated, stands back up...

                              MIDGE (O.S.)
                 This what you want?

     Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe,
     but more importantly, clutching the shotgun.  Foley crosses and
     takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when --

                              MIDGE (CONT'D)
                 It's empty.

     Foley just looks at her.

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with
     a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs...

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Maurice--

     Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing
     in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him...

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS,
     then a BODY FALL.

     He stands still.  Not sure who was just shot.  After a long moment,
     we then hear:

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the
     wall.

                              KAREN (OS) (CONT'D)
                 I know you're up there.

     INT. FOYER - SAME

     As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down
     over his face.  He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his
     pistol in another.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Jack -- don't.

                              FOLEY
                 Pretend I'm somebody else.

                              KAREN
                 You think I'd shoot you?

     Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun.  AND NOW WE HEAR
     THE SIRENS...

                              FOLEY
                 If you don't, one of those guys will.

                              KAREN
                 What're you now, a desperado?  Put the
                 guns down.

                              FOLEY
                 I told you, I'm not going back.

     He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen,
     but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or
     look around.

                              KAREN
                 Don't do this.  Please.

     They stand there staring at each other.

                              FOLEY
                 No more time outs.

     He raises the guns.  She sadly shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns,
     grabbing hold of his right thigh.  And now Cruz and several
     other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop...

                              CRUZ
                 Karen, I told you not to--

                              KAREN
                 Wait, I know him --okay?

     She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently
     lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 You just did, for Christ sake.

                              KAREN
                 You know what I mean.

     She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer
     to him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wish things were different.  I'm
                 sorry, Jack.

     Foley looks like he's in pain.  He watches as she walks back
     down the stairs.  As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and
     pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer.

                              MIDGE
                 Richard!

     She comes running down the stairs into his arms.  They embrace.
     He looks at Foley over her shoulder...

                              RIPLEY
                      (sympathetic)
                 Listen, Jack...
                      (but then)
                 What'd you do with my diamonds?

     Foley just looks at him.

     EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT

     As Buddy pulls the van into an alley.  He jumps out, jogs back
     to the street and hails a cab...

     INT. CAB - SAME

     Buddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass.

                              BUDDY
                 The airport.

     The cab pulls away.  Buddy glances up front, then pulls the
     Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up.  There's a bit of
     water in along with the diamonds.  A tiny fish swims in the
     water.  Something about this makes Buddy smile as we...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. KAREN'S HOTEL - MORNING

     The sun is out.  The sky is clear.

                              KAREN (VO)
                 They don't know yet if they want to
                 bring him up on the homicides.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

     Karen on the phone.  Her suitcase on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 I doubt if they will.  The Bureau's
                 put a detainer on him, so when they're
                 through with him here he'll go back to
                 Florida.

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Marshall on the phone...

                              MARSHALL
                 You gonna go get him?

                              KAREN
                 It's possible.  Why?

                              MARSHALL
                 I was just thinking... you could have
                 a nice time with him on the plane --
                 like picking up where your interlude,
                 or whatever you call it, left off.
                 And then throw him in the can.

                              KAREN
                 He knew what he was doing.  Nobody
                 forced him to rob banks.

                              MARSHALL
                 My little girl, the tough babe.

     Karen hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window.

     INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

     Where Foley stands staring out of his window.

                              VOICE
                 Foley.

     As Foley turns around and faces a FEDERAL MARSHAL in the doorway,
     we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled.

     INT/EXT. PRISON STATION GARAGE - DAY

     The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black
     government van waits.  The Marshal helps Foley inside.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Have a nice trip.
                      (looks OS)
                 I'll get the other one.

     INT/EXT. VAN - SAME

     As Foley sits down, stares at the floor.  He looks depressed.
     We hear the front door open, then close.

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that
     separates the front from the back.

                              KAREN
                 I got you a present, something for the
                 road.

     She pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I have to take it away, though, soon
                 as the ride's over.

     Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once
     more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with
     a shaved head -- into the back of the van.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.

     An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the
     door then gets in up front with Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 Hejira?  What kinda name is that?

                              HEJIRA
                 Islamic.

                              FOLEY
                 What's it mean, "No Hair"?

                              HEJIRA
                 The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed
                 from Mecca in 622.

                              FOLEY
                 The flight?

                              HEJIRA
                 The brothers in Leavenworth gave me
                 the name.

                              FOLEY
                 You were at Leavenworth, huh?

                              HEJIRA
                 For a time.

                              FOLEY
                 Meaning?

                              HEJIRA
                 Meaning time came, I left.

                              FOLEY
                 You busted out?

                              HEJIRA
                 I prefer to call it an exodus from an
                 undesirable place.

                              FOLEY
                      (interested now)
                 And how long was it before they caught
                 up with you?

                              HEJIRA
                 That time?

                              FOLEY
                 There were others.

                              HEJIRA
                 Yeah.  That was the ninth.

                              FOLEY
                      (really interested)
                 The ninth?

                              HEJIRA
                 Ten, you count the prison hospital in
                 Ohio I walked away from.

                              FOLEY
                 You must be some kinda walker, Henry.

                              HEJIRA
                 Hejira.

                              FOLEY
                 And so now you're off to Glades.

                              HEJIRA
                 Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to
                 leave last night with the lady marshal,
                 but for some reason she wanted to wait.

                              FOLEY
                      (looks at Karen)
                 She did, huh.

                              HEJIRA
                 Cheaper I guess, take us both down in
                 one van.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought
                 we'd have a lot to talk about.

                              HEJIRA
                 Like what?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.
                      (then)
                 It's a long way down to Florida.

     Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and
     considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little
     higher than when he first sat down, as we then...

     BLACK

     We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then...

     FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY

     The financial district.  Lots of people in suits.  A shaky,
     spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...

     JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a
     tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.  He
     starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and
     dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then...

     WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     As Foley goes inside, we then...

     CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS...

                        LOOKING FOR MONEY?

                  YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

     We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now...

     INSIDE THE BANK

     as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
     while he studies the bank layout.

     Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter
     the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
     area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes
     hands with the man and they both sit down.

     Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller
     window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
     with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA.

                              TELLER/LORETTA
                 How can I help you, sir?

                              FOLEY
                 Loretta, you see that guy talking to
                 your manager, has his case open?

     Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly,
     begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.

                              LORETTA
                 That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant
                 managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
                 but he's not in today.

                              FOLEY
                 But you see the guy with the attache
                 case?

                              LORETTA
                      (looks again)
                 Yes.

                              FOLEY
                 That's my partner.  He has a gun in
                 there.  And if you don't do exactly
                 what I tell you, or you give me any
                 kind of a problem, I'll look over at
                 my partner and he'll shoot your Mr.
                 Guindon between the eyes.

     Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Now take one of those big envelopes
                 and put as many hundreds, fifties and
                 twenties as you can pack into it.
                 Nothing with bank straps or rubber
                 bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I
                 don't want any bait money.  Start with
                 the second drawer and then the one
                 over there, under the computer.  Come
                 on, Loretta, the key's right there
                 next to you.  No bills off the bottom
                 of the drawer.
                      (as she works)
                 First time being robbed?
                      (she nods)
                 You're doing great.  Just smile,
                 Loretta, so you won't look like you're
                 being held up.
                      (she smiles awkwardly)
                 That's the way, you're doing fine.

     We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the
     front door.  When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having
     some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here, give me the twenties.  I'll put
                 'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had
                 to give my partner a sign; that's good.
                 Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds
                 till after I'm out the door, make sure
                 you haven't set off the alarm.  If you
                 have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon
                 between the eyes.  Okay?  I think
                 that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta,
                 and have a nice day.

                              LORETTA
                 You, too.

     Foley heads for the door.  He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk,
     looks back at Loretta.  Foley smiles at her, then turns to the
     Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta...

                              FOLEY
                 She's cute, isn't she?

     The man looks across the bank at Loretta.

                              MAN
                 Uh, yeah, I guess so.

     Foley winks at Loretta and walks out.

                              MAN (CONT'D)
                      (to Mr. Guindon)
                 Who was that?

     EXT. BANK - SAME

     As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Foley tries to start the car.  No go.  He tries again.

                              FOLEY
                 Come on...

     But the car won't start.  Foley bangs on the wheel...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Fuck!

     Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open
     window into Foley's ear...

                              COP
                 I think you flooded it.

     Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling,
     now has his gun pointing at him.

                              SECOND COP
                 Get out've the car, sir.

                              FOLEY
                 Wanna hear a funny story?

                              SECOND COP
                 Shut up and get out've the car.

     And as Foley obliges, we then...

     FADE TO WHITE.

     We hear a MAN GRUNT.  Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps
     through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as
     we realize he's on his way to the rim when...

     ...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     A BASKETBALL GAME in progress.  All of the men, Foley included,
     are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts.  The game is
     rough.  Hair is pulled.  Eyes are poked.  Faces punched.

     A title reads: "GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.  BELLE GLADE,
     FLORIDA."

     Foley is the oldest player here.  He's getting tired, starts to
     lose his breath.  He finally walks off the court, breathing so
     hard he can't even talk.  He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
     to come in and take his place.

     Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath.  He looks
     across the yard to where...

     A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES

     sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards.  All of
     them are over sixty.  One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches
     hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...

     INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:

     As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
     Mal and Lucky Strike packs.  Another tends to a tomato bush in
     a tiny patch of garden near the wall.  Another one sits nearby
     painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.

     Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
     his eye.  He watches as...

     TWO LATINO MEN

     both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop
     and begin stretching out.  One of them nods to Foley.  Foley
     nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks
     over to a guard, PUPKO ("PUP"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.

                              PUP
                 You want something, Foley?

     Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.

                              FOLEY
                 Some people are going out of here.
                 What if I told you where and when?

                              PUP
                 How many?

                              FOLEY
                 I expect you to look out for me, Pup,
                 let me run off work details.

                              PUP
                 Okay.  How many going out?

                              FOLEY
                 I hear six.

                              PUP
                 When?

                              FOLEY
                 Looks like tonight.

                              PUP
                 You know who they are?

                              FOLEY
                 I do, but I won't tell you just yet.
                 Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,
                 right before lock-down.

     INT. MESS HALL - LUNCH

     As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea
     of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
     at a table full of other little Latins.  CHINO -- fifties, in
     shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.

     Chino's "wife", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray
     of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
     with a bunch of bikers.

     Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
     off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too.

     EXT. MESS - DAY

     Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette.  He puts an arm
     around Lulu, starts to walk off...

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Today's the day, huh?

     Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip
     down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next
     thing to having him on a leash.

                              FOLEY
                 You excited?

                              CHINO
                 I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but I see you moved it up.

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 Why you think is today?

                              FOLEY
                 You were out running this morning,
                 sticking to your routine, anybody
                 happened to notice.  But you only did
                 a couple of miles instead of your usual
                 five.  Saving yourself for the main
                 event.  Then I see you inside eating
                 ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates
                 for endurance.

     Chino and Lulu exchange looks.

                              CHINO
                 You want, I tole you you can come.
                 You all right, Foley.  I like you.

                              FOLEY
                 You told me I can come 'cause I caught
                 you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you
                 and Lulu coming out of the bushes,
                 thought maybe you two were making out.

     Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 So what, you finish ahead of schedule?

     Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.

                              CHINO
                 You see what they doing, those posts
                 out there?  Putting up another fence,
                 five metres on the other side of the
                 one that's there.  We wait until Super
                 Bowl Sunday, they could have the second
                 fence built and we have to dig another
                 nine, ten days.  So we going soon as
                 it's dark.  You want -- I mean it --
                 you can still come.

                              FOLEY
                 I appreciate the offer.  And it's
                 tempting.

     Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence
     not twenty yards away.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 But, man, it's a long run to
                 civilization.  A hundred miles to Miami?
                 I'm too old to start acting crazy, try
                 a stunt like that.  You make it out,
                 send me a postcard.

     CUT TO: A NOTEPAD

     where we see someone has written "IT'S MAGIC!" then crossed out
     the "IT'S" and replaced it with the word "LIKE".  We hear THE
     PHONE RING AND...

     REVEAL: INT. ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Miami Beach Moderne.  ADELE -- mid-thirties, pretty, Foley's ex --
     sits at her kitchen table writing on a pad.  She grabs the phone.

                              ADELE
                 Hello?
                      (then, sighs)
                 Yeah, I accept.

     INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

     Foley on the phone...

                              FOLEY'S VOICE
                 Hey, Adele, how you doing?

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & ADELE:

                              ADELE
                 Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice?
                 Next time, leave the engine running.

                              FOLEY
                 That's funny, Adele.  How many more
                 times you gonna gimme that one?

                              ADELE
                 Till it's not funny any more.  What do
                 you want, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 You know that Super Bowl party?  They
                 changed the date.  It's on tonight,
                 eight-thirty.

                              ADELE
                 Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't
                 monitored?

                              FOLEY
                 I said not as a rule.

                              ADELE
                 So why don't you come right out and
                 tell me what you're talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there
                 in the free world.

                              ADELE
                 What's free about it?  I'm looking for
                 work.

                              FOLEY
                 What happened to Mandrake the Magician?

                              ADELE
                 Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired
                 me and hired another girl, a redhead.
                 I'm working on a new business card,
                 pass out to the cafes.  How's this
                 sound--

                              FOLEY
                      (cuts her off)
                 Listen, Adele, the reason I called,
                 that party is today instead of Sunday.
                 About eight-thirty, like only a few
                 hours from now.  So you'll have to get
                 hold of Buddy, whatever he might be
                 doing...

                              ADELE
                 And the one driving the other car?

                              FOLEY
                 What're you talking about?

                              ADELE
                 Well, seeing as you have so much luck
                 with cars, Buddy thought it might be
                 better to bring two.  He got this guy
                 he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn
                 something.

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn Michaels.

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn
                 thinks you guys are real cool.

                              FOLEY
                 He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see
                 Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step
                 on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off
                 first.

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     As MARSHALL SISCO -- fifty -- slides a small wrapped box across
     a table...

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday.

     ...to where KAREN SISCO -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair,
     a knockout -- sits.  She picks up the box and shakes it.

                              KAREN
                 You fit another Chanel suit in here?

                              MARSHALL
                 Something better.  Open it.

     Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present.  Marshall watches,
     takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how
     everyone's looking at the two of them...

                              KAREN
                      (opens the box)
                 Oh my God...

     She pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It's beautiful.

                              MARSHALL
                 It's a --

                              KAREN
                 --Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.

     She leans across the table and kisses him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Thanks, Dad.

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday, kid.
                      (then)
                 You want another Coke?

                              KAREN
                      (checks her watch)
                 Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades,
                 then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.

                              MARSHALL
                 Which one is that?  The ATF guy?

                              KAREN
                 He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now,
                 he switched over.

                              MARSHALL
                 He's still married though, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Technically.  They're separated.

                              MARSHALL
                 Oh, he's moved out?

                              KAREN
                 He's about to.

                              MARSHALL
                 Then they're not separated, are they?

                              KAREN
                 Can we change the subject?

                              MARSHALL
                 What're you doing at Glades?

                              KAREN
                 Serving process, a Summons and
                 Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory
                 life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.
                 He files suit, says he has no choice
                 in what they serve and it violates his
                 civil rights.

                              MARSHALL
                 You know you can always step in, work
                 with me full-time as one of my
                 investigators.

                              KAREN
                 No thanks.

                              MARSHALL
                 You used to like it.

                              KAREN
                 Dad...

                              MARSHALL
                 You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing
                 wrong with them necessarily if they're
                 divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy
                 cop who drinks too much and cheats on
                 his wife?  That's the way those hotshots
                 are, all of 'em.

                              KAREN
                 I really gotta go.

                              MARSHALL
                 We don't get to talk much any more.

                              KAREN
                 How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch
                 the Super Bowl with you?

                              MARSHALL
                 I'd like that.

     She gets up, kisses him again.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks for the gun, Dad.

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY

     Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk.  He looks about the
     cell.  All he's got to show for himself.  It's now quiet on
     the cellblock.  Foley closes his eyes and we...

     CUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM

     A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE
     "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing
     trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.

     Title reads: LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.  LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA.
     And then... TWO YEARS AGO.

     AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM

     Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black,
     Foley's age, shaved head.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner, as
     does Maurice.  GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look, dark shades --
     counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the
     fighter's ear.

                              BUDDY
                 Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's
                 gonna send this guy out in a body bag.

     Foley watches a MAN -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking
     as those around him.  The guy looks nervous, can feel the other
     cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet.
     Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling.  Foley turns
     and watches the fight now...

                              FOLEY
                 Anyone ever tell you why they call him
                 Snoopy?

     Buddy shakes his head.  Maurice dances around the other guy
     now.  Teases him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back
                 when he was pro.  Now you pet him, he
                 goes down.

     The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely
     glances off Maurice's jaw.  Sure enough, Maurice makes a big
     show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally
     goes down.

                              BUDDY
                 I don't believe it.

     Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him
     and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as
     nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's
     pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons.  He throws
     a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning
     technique...

                              BUDDY
                 Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight.
                 Fuckin' pathetic.

     Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now
     stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one
     hand thrust into his pocket.  Foley watches as Maurice stops
     the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the
     fights -- as he comes out into the yard.

                              FOLEY
                 It's Richard Ripley.

                              BUDDY
                      (looking now)
                 The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I
                 didn't recognize him without his rug.

     Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy
     nodding, acquiescent, respectful.

                              FOLEY
                 Dick the Ripper they called him, on
                 account of all the people he ripped
                 off.

     Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he doin' here?

                              GLENN (OS)
                 Three years.

     They look to where Glenn Michaels, the blond guy in dark shades
     we saw in Maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few
     feet away.  He's shirtless, tan, in shape.

                              GLENN
                 He got three years and fined fifty
                 million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking
                 check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed
                 his name.
                      (struggles with the
                       bar)
                 Whoa-- little help here!

                              FOLEY
                 Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or
                 Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those
                 shades on.

                              GLENN
                 You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!

                              FOLEY
                 I guess the bright glare out here made
                 it hard to see the numbers on the
                 weights.

                              GLENN
                 I'll take the shades off.  Just get
                 this fuckin' thing off me.

     Foley helps him get the bar up.  Glenn sits up.

                              BUDDY
                 How do you know he wrote a check?

                              GLENN
                 He told me.  He works the laundry with
                 me.  The guy loves to talk.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney.  I hear he
                 rolled over on all the snitches he was
                 doing business with and got 'em all
                 brought up.

     He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley, one eye always on the
     swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, anybody that can write a check
                 for fifty mil, he says anything I'm
                 all fucking ears.  Like the other day,
                 he tells me how he's got all this money
                 in foreign banks, plus around five mil
                 in uncut diamonds at his house.  He
                 said, quote, "Where I can put my hands
                 on it anytime."

                              BUDDY
                 Cool.  Where's the guy live?

     Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley.
     Again, Ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making
     notations...

                              GLENN
                 Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut
                 diamonds are as easy to move as cash.

                              FOLEY
                 Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              GLENN
                 So.  What's your point?

                              FOLEY
                 My point is, that's probably what you're
                 gonna end up with.

                              GLENN
                 You think he's lying?

                              FOLEY
                 Use your head.  The guys got five
                 million lying around his house, you
                 really think he's gonna tell some
                 motormouth he just met in prison about
                 it?

     A BELL SOUNDS.  Everyone starts walking for the gate.

     Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate,
     Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket.

     SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who
     moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him... his
     left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like
     congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket
     and we see the long metal shiv--

                              BUDDY
                      (watching Snoopy)
                 Here it comes.

     Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs
     him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away.  The Boxer
     stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last
     jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose,
                 even if it's on purpose.

     We hear a WHISTLE BLOW as a GUARD spots the body.  And now
     everyone moves like hell for the gate... except for...

     Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the
     body.

     Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes
     Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks
     to him as they walk into the block...

                              FOLEY
                 You don't wanna be standing there, the
                 hacks start asking questions you don't
                 wanna answer.

                              RIPLEY
                 Oh, uh, right, thanks...

     Foley then moves away.  He sees Maurice looking back at him,
     giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW)

     He lies there another moment when...

     A PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk.
     Foley's CELLMATE jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the
     toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the
     bathroom.  Foley shakes his head and turns away...

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling
     a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door,
     when he sees...

     A WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come
     out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries.

     Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman
     is opening her trunk before coming forward...

                              BUDDY
                 Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.

     She doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the
     groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock.

                              WOMAN
                 I didn't ask for your help, so don't
                 expect a tip.

     Buddy smiles, waves her off.

                              BUDDY
                 That's okay, ma'am.  I'll just take
                 your car.

     She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     In the midst of a remodel.  As door opens and Pup comes in.
     Foley puts a finger to his lips...

                              FOLEY
                 They're right underneath you, Pup.
                 They dug a tunnel.

     Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the
     chapel, eyes on the floor, listening...

                              PUP
                 I don't hear 'em.  Where's the tunnel
                 come out?

     Pup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of
     the pews to a window.

                              FOLEY
                 Second fence post from the tower out
                 there.  Go on, take a look.

     As Pup stares out the window...

                              PUP
                 I don't see nothing there.

     Foley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT
     CRUCIFIX.  He picks it up, starts up the aisle...

                              FOLEY
                 You will directly.  Keep watching.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - DUSK

     As the high beams from her car show the prison parking area,
     then the fence strung with razor wire.  Karen parks near the
     fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone.

                              KAREN
                 Hi.  Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.
                      (beat)
                 He's not?  Could you tell him that...
                 never mind.  I'll call back.

     Headlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind
     her.  The lights go off, then come on again.  She adjusts the
     mirror to deflect the glare.

     INT. THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK

     As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field.
     He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen
     checks her face out in the rear-view.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     As Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor,
     holds the crucifix down against his leg.

                              PUP
                 There some car headlights out there...
                      (then)
                 Jesus Christ...

     Now he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it...

                              PUP (CONT'D)
                 Man outside the fence!  By tower six!
                      (responds to radio)
                 This is Officer Pupko...
                      (then)
                 I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake!

     Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it
     smack against the side of Pup's head.  Drops him clean with one
     swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a
     sound coming from him.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT

     As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car
     door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there,
     crouching down.

     Karen turns on her headlights.  No, not crouched.  The guy is
     coming out of the ground.  On this side of the fence.

     Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the
     ground.  Right in front of her.

     Karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by
     the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised
     there for a moment before taking off into the dark.  Karen gets
     out of the car...

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow
     the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before
     the men disappear into the dark.

     Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he
     gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her
     trunk...

                              BUDDY
                 What's she doing?

     He watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a
     holstered pistol.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     But then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there
     again and comes out this time racking a shotgun.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     And now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and
     raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND.
     Buddy gets out of the car...

     EXT. PARKING AREA - SAME

     As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty,
     standing by the hole they just crawled out of.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands in the air!

     Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds,
     start edging away -- shit, they've come this far.

     They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark,
     then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate,
     to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it
     for the cons.  They take off running...

     Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't
     fire...

     The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it,
     open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are
     cut down as they run.

     The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more
     interested in the hole the convicts had come out of.  Now they're
     standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons
     ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other
     as...

     A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying
     something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited,
     pointing towards the orange grove.

     They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to
     see if they're alive, then keep going.

     The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out.  He takes his time,
     puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an
     honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes.

     Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the
     shotgun on Buddy.  Buddy raises the palm of his hand.

                              BUDDY
                 It's okay, honey, we're good guys.

                              KAREN
                 What're you doing here?

     Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when
     they're already pretty sure what you're doing.  She glances
     around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature
     out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck.

     She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the
     shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip.

     They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still
     up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence,
     past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange
     grove.  A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet that's all the hacks they send
                 out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind
                 the store.

                              BUDDY
                 Why don't we talk about it later?

     He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the
     headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you're just a girl.  What do you
                 do for a living you pack a shotgun?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest, both of you guys.

     Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious
     thought, but what he says is...

                              FOLEY
                 I bet I smell, don't I?
                      (then)
                 Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll
                 get out of here.

     Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk.  She's
     reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when...

     Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against
     the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're
     cuddled up in bed.

     He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the
     gun in his face.  Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then
     everything goes...

     BLACK

     Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing.
     Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You comfy?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 If I could have a little more room.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 There isn't any.  All this shit you
                 got in here.  What is all this stuff
                 anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's
                 this can?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 For your breath.  You could use it.
                 Squirt some in your mouth.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've
                 you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor
                 unfortunate offenders.

     A BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it
     on.  He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he
     looks at all of her now and finally says...

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 Where's your gun, your pistol?

                              KAREN
                 In my bag, in the car.

     They go over some bumps.  We hear men's voices from somewhere
     far off, outside.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know you don't have a chance of
                 making it.  Guards are out here already,
                 they'll stop the car.

     He runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also,
     just, well, looking.

                              FOLEY
                 They're off in the cane by now chasing
                 Cubans.  I timed it to slip between
                 the cracks, you might say.

                              KAREN
                 I believe it.  You've ruined a nine-
                 hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, went real nice with that twelve
                 gauge, too.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, why in the world would someone
                 like you ever become a federal marshall?

                              KAREN
                 The idea of going after guys like you
                 appealed to me.

                              FOLEY
                 Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even
                 though I've been celibate lately, I'm
                 not gonna force myself on you.  I've
                 never done that in my life.

                              KAREN
                 You wouldn't have time anyway.  We
                 come to a roadblock, they'll run the
                 car, find out in five seconds who it
                 belongs to.

                              FOLEY
                 If they get set up in time, which I
                 doubt.  And even if they do they'll be
                 looking for a buncha little Latin
                 fellas, not a big black guy driving a
                 Ford.

                              KAREN
                 Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass
                 like this.

     More bumps.  Then picking up speed as the road smooths out.

                              FOLEY
                 Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy.
                 Back when we jailed together, he'd
                 call his sister every week without
                 fail.  She's a born-again Christian,
                 does bookkeeping for a televangelist.
                 Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins,
                 tells her about whatever bank he
                 happened to rob.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy.  That's his given name?

                              FOLEY
                      (woops, beat)
                 One I gave him, yeah.

                 So, what's your name?  It'll be in the
                 paper tomorrow anyway.

                              FOLEY
                 Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of
                 me.

                              KAREN
                 Why, are you famous?

                              FOLEY
                 Time I was convicted in California?
                 FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than
                 anyone in the computer.

                              KAREN
                 How many was that?

                              FOLEY
                 Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I
                 started when I was eighteen, driving
                 for my Uncle Cully and his partner,
                 Gus.  They go into a bank this one
                 time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter
                 to get the tellers and breaks his leg.
                 All three of us ended up in Angola.

                              KAREN
                 That's funny.

                              FOLEY
                 I thought so, too.

                              KAREN
                 It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on
                 the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 I believe you would have.  Another fall,
                 I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I
                 don't mean the place next door where
                 some of Nixon's people went.

                              KAREN
                 I know the difference.  You were in
                 Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary.
                 I've delivered people there.  So
                 basically you've spent half your life
                 in prison.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I
                 do a full thirty years, no time off.
                 Can you imagine looking at that?

                              KAREN
                 I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.

     He looks at her, then looks away as we...

                              KAREN
                 Of course I am.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't act like it.

                              KAREN
                 What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I
                 don't think it would help much.
                      (then)
                 I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy,
                 and wait for you to screw up.

                 You were married?  All those falls,
                 I'm surprised you had time.

                 It was just a year, give or take a few
                 days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't
                 get along or anything.  We had fun, we
                 just didn't have that... that thing,
                 you know?  That spark, you know what I

                 You ever see pictures of him, the way
                 he wore his hat?  You could tell he
                 had that don't-give-a-shit air about
                 him.

                              KAREN
                 I don't recall his hat, but I've seen
                 pictures of him lying dead, shot by
                 Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't
                 have his shoes on?

                              FOLEY

                 bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker

                 was eating a sandwich.

                              FOLEY
                 I mean if you didn't know who I was.

                              KAREN
                 You'd probably tell me.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just saying I think if we met under
                 different circumstances...

                              KAREN
                 You have to be kidding.

     Silence.  Foley tries to get back to where it was working...

                              FOLEY
                 Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked,
                 Three Days of the Condor.

                              KAREN
                 With Robert Redford, when he was young.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah...

     They lie there a moment, think about that as we hear THE CAR
     SLOWING DOWN, coasting, then bumping along the shoulder of the
     road to a stop.

                              KAREN
                 I never thought it made sense, though,
                 the way they got together so quick.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.

                              KAREN
                 I mean, romantically.

                              FOLEY
                 Uh-huh.
                      (then)
                 Well, but if --

     The trunk goes dark again as the car's turned off.

                              BUDDY (OS)
                 You still alive in there?

     And the trunk lid raises so that we see Karen and Foley lying
     in the back.  Foley gets out.  Karen doesn't move.

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Where in the hell are we?

                              BUDDY
                 That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's
                 waiting with the other car.

                              FOLEY
                 Okay, honey, come on out of there.

     Karen pushes off, rolls from her right side to her left, brings
     up her Sig Sauer in both hands to put it on them, both standing
     in the opening, in the dark, but right there.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands up and turn around.
                 Now.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite
     directions as she begins firing from the inside...

     As Buddy and Foley hook up again in front of the car.  We can
     see they're beneath an overpass.  Foley stares at the trunk.

                              BUDDY
                 We may as well leave her, we're leaving
                 the car and we gotta leave her some place
                 anyway, what's the difference where?

                              FOLEY
                 She's coming with us.

     Foley walks to the passenger seat, reaches in the window.

                              BUDDY
                 Jesus Christ, what were you doing in
                 there?

                              FOLEY
                 Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd
                 like to know who she is.

     Foley takes her wallet, looks at her driver's licence photo.

                              BUDDY
                 I already looked.  Her name is Karen
                 Sisco.  Like the Cisco Kid only spelled
                 different, S-i-s-c-o.

     A sheriff's green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep
     to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment
     of the overpass.  When the road quiets down, Foley moves to the
     trunk and bangs on it once with his fist.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen?  Be a good girl now, you hear?
                 Now, I'm gonna open the--

     Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're putting holes in your car!

     He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him.
     He settles down, then...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 We're not leaving you.  I'm gonna open
                 the trunk enough for you to throw the
                 gun out.  Okay?  You shoot -- Buddy's
                 got your shotgun, says he'll shoot
                 back if you do and I can't stop him.
                 So it's up to you.

     Foley puts his hand out and Buddy, still looking at him funny,
     gives him the keys.

                              VOICE
                 Hey!

     Coming from somewhere above them.

                              VOICE (CONT'D)
                 It's me, Glenn.

     Foley steps out into the open, Buddy close behind him.  They
     look up to see a figure, head and shoulders against the evening
     sky, leaning on the concrete overpass rail.  We can see his
     long blond hair falling beside his face, now half-concealed
     behind dark sunglasses.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, Jack, good to see you, man.  The
                 fuck're you guys shooting at?

     Foley looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 Do we need him?

                              BUDDY
                 The green-and-whites saw us.  One of
                 'em starts thinking, what's that car
                 doing there?  Ties it to the break and
                 turns around...

     Foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were
                 somebody else.

                              GLENN
                 Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since
                 Lompoc.  What's going on?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, nuthin'.

     Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs
     on the trunk.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You coming out?

     Foley sticks the key in the lock as Buddy steps up to the trunk
     and racks the pump on the shotgun.  Foley leans close to the
     metal.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You hear that?

     He turns the key and raises the lid.  Karen, bunched in there,
     extends her arm, her hand holding the Sig Sauer by the barrel.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     "Jack."  Buddy gives him another funny look.

     EXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT

     As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen
     Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS."

                              FOLEY
                 Have your clothes cleaned and send me
                 the bill.

     Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade,
     move through the scrub.  Glenn leans against the car, flashers
     blinking.

                              KAREN
                 I'll send it to you at Glades.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a
                 sewer?

                              FOLEY
                 Take your sunglasses off.

                              GLENN
                 I see better with them on.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw
                 'em off the overpass while they're
                 still on your head.

     Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Wait in the car.

                              GLENN
                 You're in civilization now, man, ease
                 up.

                              FOLEY
                 I'd like you to go wait in the car.
                 How's that?  Take her with you and put
                 her in back.

                              GLENN
                 In the trunk?

                              FOLEY
                 The backseat.

     Foley stares at him, waiting.  Glenn motions to Karen...

                              GLENN
                 Come on.  I have to do what I'm told.

     She walks past Foley without looking at him.

                              FOLEY
                 Wait a minute.  Let me have your
                 raincoat.
                      (looks at Buddy)
                 Somebody forgot to bring me clean
                 clothes.

                              BUDDY
                 I brought 'em, they're back at Glades
                 in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take
                 her car.

                              KAREN
                 You can blame me if you want.  I don't
                 mind.

     He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds
     it up, then throws it at Foley's feet.

                              GLENN
                 Here you are, sir.

     Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back
     on and takes Karen by the arm.

                              BUDDY
                 What's wrong with you?

     Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the
     backseat.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll
                 never know.

                              BUDDY
                 How 'bout the score was his idea to
                 begin with?

                              FOLEY
                 His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's
                 got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you
                 and me figured the whole thing out.

     Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform,
     all of them caked with muck.

                              BUDDY
                 You're pulling at it.  Here...

     He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard
     shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and
     tearing the shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know why, but every time he
                 opens his mouth I want to punch him
                 out.

                              BUDDY
                 He ain't the problem, Jack.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You wanna pull your head outta your
                 ass and tell me why we're bringing her
                 with us?

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome
     light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door.
     He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs
     his hand through his hair...

                              GLENN
                 ...if he thinks he can talk to me like
                 this.  Shit, I don't even know what I
                 need them for.

     Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against
     the dark foliage.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 I got a big score lined up up north.
                 They wouldn't even know about it, it
                 wasn't for me.  I could do it right
                 now myself, except it's so fucking
                 cold up there in January--

                              KAREN
                 Glenn?

     His head turns so that we can see his designer shades.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You don't remember me, do you?

                              GLENN
                      (beat)
                 It couldn't have been out at Glades,
                 if that's what you're thinking.  I was
                 never out there.

                              KAREN
                 No, that's not what I'm thinking.

     He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face.

                              GLENN
                 But you're sure we've met, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Last fall, I drove you from the Palm
                 Beach county jail to the federal
                 courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn
                 Michaels.
                      (then)
                 I never forget anyone I've cuffed and
                 shackled.

     He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's
     been turned to stone.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if
                 we can work this out...

     He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Do we have a gun in the car?

                              GLENN
                 I remember you now.  Shit.

                              KAREN
                 Foley's not going to make it.  And if
                 he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.

     She touches his shoulder and he jumps.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Look, I can understand if you and Foley
                 are close.

                              GLENN
                 We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--

                              KAREN
                 Wait.  Have you helped him, Glenn?  At
                 this point, technically, I doubt you
                 could be charged with aiding a fugitive.
                 So you still have a choice.  You can
                 help him and risk going down again,
                 get cuffed and shackled, hope to God
                 you pull a reasonable judge, not some
                 hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it
                 another way...

     She pauses.  He turns and looks at her.

                              GLENN
                 Like how?

     EXT. OVERPASS - SAME

     Foley watches a car pass on the highway.

                              BUDDY
                 You want to take her to my place and
                 get cleaned up?  You come out of the
                 bathroom with your after-shave on and
                 she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?

                              FOLEY
                 I want to talk to her again, that's
                 all.  See what would happen under, you
                 know, normal circumstances.

                              BUDDY
                 You're too late, Jack.

     Foley doesn't say anything.  Just takes a deep breath as we
     HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over...

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 He wants to get out of here and I don't
                 blame him.

     They start towards the car.  Then stop and watch as it takes
     off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement.  Their backs
     to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're
     out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word.

     We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER...

     CUT TO: A CORRIDOR IN LOMPOC FPC

     As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named HIMEY
     -- strut purposefully up the hall.  They step into...

     THE PRISON LIBRARY

     Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big
     coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH."

                              MAURICE
                 Dick.  My man.

     Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the
     library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I got your fishies for you.

     He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the
     table.

                              RIPLEY
                      (reaches for them)
                 Thank you...

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls them back)
                 Not so fast, Dick.
                      (off Ripley's look)
                 Starting now, there's gonna be an across
                 the board cost a living increase.

                              RIPLEY
                 What?

                              MAURICE
                 Year ago, I come in here on credit
                 card fraud, but after I shanked that
                 loudmouth pussy on the yard the other
                 day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone
                 way the fuck up.

                              RIPLEY
                 I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.  But
                 then, I could be wrong...

                              MAURICE
                 Whoever.  The point is, prices are
                 goin' up, too.  Better get your little
                 black book out, Richard.  We got some
                 business to talk about.

     Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Let's start with the fish.  They was
                 two grand, but now they's three.

     Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you
                 asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

                              RIPLEY
                      (writing)
                 Well, I need that...

                              MAURICE
                 ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an
                 even three c's.

                              VOICE
                 Hey.

     They all look to where...

     JACK FOLEY

     Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of
     some kind.  Himey gives him a mean stare.  Foley points to a
     sign that says "QUIET PLEASE."

                              FOLEY
                 Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't
                 you guys read?

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 There a problem, Foley?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah.

     Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the
                 dumbest fucking shakedown in the history
                 of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred
                 bucks for a pillow?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              RIPLEY
                 Sounds high, doesn't it?

                              FOLEY
                 Must be a real soft pillow.

                              MAURICE
                 Faux goose down.

                              RIPLEY
                 Still...

                              FOLEY
                 How much for your company at chow?

                              MAURICE
                 Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet.  How much?

                              MAURICE
                 Another C.

     Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this
                 guy to fuck off.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?  Well, I uhhh...

                              FOLEY
                 First of all, if he kills you, he's
                 not gonna get any more money out of
                 you.

     Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point.

                              MAURICE
                 Man doesn't have to get killed.  He
                 could accidentally fall on something
                 sharp, like a shiv.  Or my dick.

     Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.

                              FOLEY
                 You stick anything in this guy, Snoop,
                 they transfer his ass outta here
                 faster'n you can throw a fight, and
                 you still end up with nothing.

     Ripley nods, takes this in.

                              MAURICE
                 This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why
                 don't you go on out to the yard, have
                 yourself a smoke?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't smoke.

                              HIMEY
                      (slowly rising)
                 You heard the man.  Go on outta here.

     Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.

                              MAURICE
                 Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
                 He's ranked number thirty-two in the
                 federal prison system.

                              FOLEY
                      (looking at Himey)
                 Thirty-two outta what, twenty?

     Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock
     Foley in the head when...

     ...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand,
     like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual
     into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending
     his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor
     back-first with a loud thud.

     Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A
     WHISTLE.  They all freeze, look to...

     A PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE

     Who nods towards the door.  We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS,
     takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up,
     covers his now bleeding nose.

                              GUARD
                 What's going on here?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, you know, reading's funnamental
                 an' shit, we just excited.

                              GUARD
                 Clear outta here.

     The guard exits.  Maurice and Foley are still staring at each
     other.

                              RIPLEY
                 Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the
                 fish thing?

                              MAURICE
                      (looks at Foley)
                 Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

     He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into
     Ripley's open hand.  Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a
     fist, crushing the fish.  He taps his fist to Ripley's.

                              RIPLEY
                 That's how you do it.

     Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with
     Himey.  Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at
     Foley.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thanks for your help.

                              FOLEY
                 Any time.

     We hear a PHONE RING and then...

     CUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW)

     As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, fool.  Stick and jab.

     A frisbee whizzes past the television.  We hear A DOG YELP OS.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Hey!  Watch that shit!

     Maurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a
     green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE
     RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                      (calls OS)
                 Tuffy.  C'mere, boy...

                              MAURICE
                 You gonna answer the phone?

                              MOSELLE
                 What for?  It's not for me.

     Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a
     little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's
     head.

                              MOSELLE (CONT'D)
                 Bad dog.

                              MAURICE
                      (scoops up the dog)
                 Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my
                 little Tuffy?

     He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child.

                              MOSELLE
                 I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a
                 Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra
                 money.

     He looks at her.

                              MAURICE
                 That's the dumbest thing I heard in my
                 life.  Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't
                 pay for shit.  You gonna get a gig,
                 it's gotta be for one of the big three:
                 Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit
                 for the fat dogs.  Now answer the fuckin
                 phone.

     She comes over, picks up the phone.

                              MOSELLE
                 Hello?
                      (hands it to Maurice)
                 For you.

                              MAURICE
                      (takes it)
                 This is me.

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - GAS STATION - NIGHT

     An antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone.

                              GLENN
                 Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.

     INTERCUTTING GLENN & MAURICE:

                              MAURICE
                 Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a
                 them psychic friends.  I was just
                 thinkin' about you.

     Glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln
     Town Car and jogs to the john.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to
                 Detroit and need a place to crash.

                              MAURICE
                 You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin
                 one degree outside.

                              GLENN
                 I wanna talk to you about a job.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.

                              GLENN
                 I can't really go into it right now.
                 I'll just tell you it's someone big.

                              MAURICE
                 Someone?  Gimme a hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's a guy you know.

                              MAURICE
                 Gimme another hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's Richard Ripley.

     Maurice doesn't say a word.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 You there?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here.
                 Question is, why aren't you here?

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy hurry up the front steps.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

                              BUDDY
                 Cause she had her hand on her gun the
                 whole time, waiting to make her move.

     Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're just jealous it was me in the
                 trunk with her and not you.

                              BUDDY
                 You're right.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A "hideout."  Not much in the way of furnishings.  Foley follows
     Buddy inside, watches as he bolts the door.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing I'm gonna do is get all
                 this mud off me.

     Foley starts for the bathroom.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I've been dreaming about a hot bath
                 for the last six months.  Soak the prison
                 off me.

                              BUDDY
                 There's some lilac oil, you want some,
                 a vanilla candle under the sink.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, man.

                              BUDDY
                 There's something about a nice hot
                 bath, transforms a person.  It's not
                 just about opening up your pores, know
                 what I mean?  There's just something
                 about the heat and the wet that's
                 calming you know?  Settles me in a way
                 that I really can't articulate.

                              FOLEY
                 I know exactly what you mean.  It's
                 just a feeling.
                      (beat)
                 You know, I could go for some wine
                 tonight.

                              BUDDY
                 There's a store around the corner,
                 I'll be right back.

                              FOLEY
                 Sounds great.

     Foley goes into the bathroom.  A moment later WE HEAR THE BATH
     RUNNING.

     INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

     As Buddy leaves the apartment, starts down the hall, KAREN STEPS
     INTO FRAME, watches as he disappears down the stairs.  Gun drawn,
     she then moves towards the apartment.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     As Foley undresses, picks up a candle off the sink and smells
     it.  He notices his nude image in the mirror and checks himself
     out.

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     As Karen slips the door.  She looks around, HEARS THE WATER
     RUNNING.

     She racks the slide on her gun, snicks off the safety and starts
     for the bathroom.  Suddenly, the water is turned off.  She stops
     where she is.  She then moves a careful step at a time towards
     the open doorway.

     Gradually the tub comes into view, beginning with Foley's feet
     resting crossed on the other end, then the middle of the tub,
     then she's in the doorway, looking down at...

     Foley, lying there in the tub, his eyes closed.  Karen cuts her
     eyes down the length of him, taking a moment here to check him
     out, long enough for Foley to open his eyes and grab her hand,
     the one holding the gun.

                              FOLEY
                 Hey.

     They look at each other a moment.  He then pulls her down to
     him and kisses her.  She kisses him back.  He then pulls her
     into the tub with him as we now hear...

                              MARSHALL SISCO (VO)
                 Karen...?

     CUT TO: KAREN

     As she opens her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 What?

     REVEAL: A HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Flowers everywhere.  Karen -- bruises on her face -- lies in
     bed.  Her father, Marshall, sits on the chair beside her.

                              MARSHALL
                 You were talking in your sleep.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 What'd I say?

                              MARSHALL
                 "Hey, yourself."

                              KAREN
                 Huh.

     We hear A KNOCK at the door.  They look to where Special Agent
     DANIEL BURDON -- black, forties, expensive suit -- stands in
     the doorway, file in one hand.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hello, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                      (to Marshall)
                 Daniel Burdon, FBI.

                              MARSHALL
                 Marshall Sisco.  Karen's dad.

                              BURDON
                 You mind please waiting outside.  We
                 have some business to do here.

     Marshall looks at him a moment.  Then, to Karen...

                              MARSHALL
                 I need to go to the john anyway.

     Burdon waits for Marshall to walk out, then sits down.

                              KAREN
                 I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                 That's nice of you to offer, Karen,
                 but I got all the help I can use right
                 now.  Instead, let's talk about how
                 you got the bump on your head.

                              KAREN
                      (indicates file)
                 Isn't that my report you're holding
                 onto?

                              BURDON
                 Yes, but I want to hear you tell it.
                 Starting with when you tried to grab
                 the wheel -- where was this?

                              KAREN
                 Coming to the Okeechobee exit...

     And now we see it...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars...

                              KAREN
                 Take the next exit.

                              GLENN
                 What am I supposed to do now?

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, take the exit.

                              GLENN
                 No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna
                 turn myself in.

     She reaches over and grabs the wheel.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 The fuck are you doing?!

     He hits the brakes.  The car goes off the road, down the grade,
     the abutment coming right at us as we go back to...

     THE HOSPITAL ROOM

     As Burdon sets the file down, sits back now.

                              KAREN
                 The next thing I knew, the paramedics
                 were taking me out the car.

     Burdon looks at Karen a moment, then...

                              BURDON
                 There's a couple of points I keep
                 wondering about have to do with the
                 two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is
                 it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I
                 swear the man must've robbed two hundred
                 banks in his time.

                              KAREN
                 Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't
                 remember how many he robbed.

                              BURDON
                 You talked to him?

                              KAREN
                 In the trunk, yeah?

                              BURDON
                 What'd you talk about?

                              KAREN
                 Oh... different things, prison, movies.

                              BURDON
                 This fella holds you hostage, you talk
                 about movies?

                              KAREN
                 It was an unusual experience.

                              BURDON
                 Foley made me think of that fella Carl
                 Tillman, the one you were seeing, it
                 turns out the same time he was doing
                 banks.  You recall that?

                              KAREN
                 When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't
                 know he robbed banks.

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe
                 he did, and I told you.  So you had to
                 at least suspect him.

                              KAREN
                 And what happened to Carl?

                              BURDON
                 The time came, you shot him.  But you
                 didn't shoot Foley or the guy with
                 him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
                 and you let them throw you in the trunk.
                 Okay, now you got your Sig in your
                 hand.  You say in the report you
                 couldn't turn around, he had you pinned
                 down.  But when the trunk opened, how
                 come you didn't cap the two guys then?

                              KAREN
                 Is that what you would've done?

                              BURDON
                 You say in the report Glenn didn't
                 have a gun, but you let him get away,
                 too.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel, what do you work on most of
                 the time, fraud?  Go after crooked
                 bookkeepers.

                              BURDON
                 Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen
                 years, on all kinds of investigations.

                              KAREN
                 Have you ever shot a man?  How many
                 times have you been primary through
                 the door?

                              BURDON
                 I have to qualify, is that it?

                              KAREN
                 You have to know what you're talking
                 about.

     We hear CHUCKLING OS.  Burdon glances at the doorway where we
     see Marshall now standing, enjoying this.

                              BURDON
                 We'll talk another time, Karen.  All
                 right?  I'd like to know why Foley put
                 you in that second car when he didn't
                 need you any more.

                              KAREN
                 You'll have to ask him.

                              BURDON
                 Sounds to me like he liked having you
                 around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr.
                 Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Agent Burdon.

     Marshall waits for him to walk out...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 The white man's Burdon.  That's what
                 everybody calls him in Miami.  The
                 Metro-Dade guys.  He's got a knack for
                 pissing people off.

     She's not listening.  He sits down, takes her hand...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 What are you thinking about?

                              KAREN
                 The Sig Sauer you got me for my
                 birthday.

                              MARSHALL
                 Tell you what, you're a good girl, you
                 might get another one for Christmas.

     She looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 I'll get it back when I get Foley.

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     A dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy
     climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm,
     newspaper under the other.  An old woman comes out the door as
     Buddy opens it and squints at him.

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen?

                              BUDDY
                 Uh, no, ma'am.  Sorry.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Buddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream.
     This one's nicer, with a view of the beach.  Jack stands on the
     balcony going through KAREN'S PURSE.

     He pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo.
     He does the same with her gym I.D. card.  He finds her address
     book and opens it up.  A photo of her father slips out.  Jack
     examines it a moment, then flips through the book.

     He stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in
     and comes up with her us Marshal I.D.  He slips it open and
     studies the badge and the picture opposite.

     He holds on to it, looks out at the ocean, but really sees...

     THE OPEN TRUNK OF THE CAR - LAST NIGHT

     As Karen gets out, saying...

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     BACK IN THE APARTMENT

     Foley turns away from the view as Buddy walks in, sets the
     grocery bag down on the coffee table.

                              BUDDY
                 You made the front page.

     He holds up the newspaper so that Foley can see his picture on
     the front page: an unflattering mug shot that doesn't look all
     that much like him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They pass this picture around you can
                 go anywhere you want, nobody'll know
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't feeling my best that day.
                 I'd just drawn thirty to life.

                              BUDDY
                 Maybe this'll make you feel better.

     Buddy reaches into the bag, tosses Foley a NEW ZIPPO.

                              FOLEY
                 Thanks.

     Foley catches the lighter, immediately begins playing with it.
     He looks at the paper on the coffee table as Buddy sits down,
     pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag.

                              BUDDY
                 Paper says there's ten grand each on
                 you, Chino and Lulu.

                              FOLEY
                 Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?

                              BUDDY
                 Just that she got away.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but what happened after she drove
                 off with Glenn?

                              BUDDY
                 You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most
                 likely, he's on his way to Detroit,
                 where we should be.

     Foley walks back out on to the balcony, looks at the contents of
     Karen's bag spread out on the table.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You realize what you're doing?  Worrying
                 about a person that works in law
                 enforcement.  You want to sit down and
                 have cocktails with a girl that tried
                 to shoot you.  You hear what I'm saying?

     Foley holds up the picture of Marshall Sisco.

                              FOLEY
                 Think this old guy is her boyfriend?
                 It's the only picture she carries.

                              BUDDY
                 Am I going to Detroit by myself?

     Foley picks up her drivers licence photo.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Longer we hang around down here, Jack,
                 better chance there is either Glenn's
                 gonna fuck up the whole score, or we
                 gonna get busted, or both.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll leave first thing in the morning.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Right on a marina.  Boats bobbing on the water.

                              MARSHALL (VO)
                 Is this Foley?

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Marshall sits in his chair holding up a newspaper as Karen hands
     him a drink.  She stares at the photograph.

                              KAREN
                 He doesn't even look like that.

                              MARSHALL
                 No?

                              KAREN
                 No, he looks a lot...

     She realizes Marshall's watching her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Different.

     The doorbell RINGS.  She ignores his look, gets up.  Walks to
     the door and opens it to reveal RAY NICOLET, boots, leather
     jacket, etc.  Cowboy Cop.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hi, Ray.

                              RAY
                 You look great.  Your dad taking good
                 care of you?

                              KAREN
                 He took the week off so we'd have time
                 together.  So far he's worked on his
                 boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.

     Marshall gets up, shakes his head.

                              RAY
                 I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Likewise.

                              KAREN
                 Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force,
                 working on the prison break.

                              MARSHALL
                      (eyeing his T-shirt)
                 I see that.

     Ray turns to Karen, holding his jacket open to show the task
     force inscription on his T-shirt in red, the guy's .357 tucked
     into his waistband.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 In case no one knows what he does.
                 Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says,
                 "Undercover"?

                              RAY
                 No.  Course not.

                              KAREN
                      (changing the subject)
                 How's it going?

                              RAY
                 Great.  We got one of 'em.

     Karen looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

                              MARSHALL
                      (before he can answer)
                 Off a tip?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in
                 this hobo camp out by the airport,
                 called the number--

                              MARSHALL
                 I knew it, soon as I saw they were
                 offering a reward.

     She grabs Nicolet by the arm.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

     Marshall looks at her.

                              RAY
                 Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the
                 Cubans.  Linares.

                              KAREN
                 Oh...

                              RAY
                 We went out there, full SWAT, two
                 choppers, the whole bit, but Linares
                 started shooting anyway.  We put him
                 down, but somehow Chirino got away.

                              MARSHALL
                 Did you pay the guy the reward?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, as soon as we got back.

                              KAREN
                 Foley hadn't been there?

     Her father gives her a look.

                              RAY
                 This place was strictly Cuban.  If
                 Foley had a ride he must have his own
                 agenda. He seems to be the only one
                 knows what he's doing.

     THE PHONE RINGS.  Marshall moves to it.

                              MARSHALL
                 Hello?
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.
                      (hands her the phone)
                 For you.

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

     CUT TO: FOLEY ON THE PHONE - DAY

     On the balcony.  Flipping through a copy of Vogue while Buddy
     watches television inside.

                              FOLEY
                 Hi.

     INTERCUTTING KAREN & FOLEY - DAY

     Karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray
     drones on.

                              FOLEY
                 You know who this is?

                              KAREN
                 Yes.

     She walks out to her father's balcony now.

                              FOLEY
                 I just wanted to see if you're okay,
                 make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or,
                 you know, anything.

                              MARSHALL
                 Something I've been wondering, Ray...

     Marshall picks up the newspaper...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 It says in the headline, "I slept with
                 a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."
                 She lives in Little Havana, her
                 husband's out of town working when one
                 of the escapees shows up at her door...

     She closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you get this number?

                              FOLEY
                 Who was it answered the phone?

                              KAREN
                 None of your business.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just worried maybe I'm not old
                 enough for you.

                              KAREN
                 That's my dad.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.  He has a cop's face.

                              KAREN
                 How do you know?  Wait-- you have my
                 wallet.

                              FOLEY
                 And your gun.

                              KAREN
                 Think I could have them back?

                              FOLEY
                 How do we do that?

                              KAREN
                 Let's see.  You could come on by my
                 dad's place, drop 'em off.

                              FOLEY
                 Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the
                 S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.

     Foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's
     been looking for: an ad for Defiance perfume.

                              KAREN
                 There's a guy here on the task force
                 right now.  Maybe I should put him on
                 the phone, let you two work it out.

                              FOLEY
                 You won't do that.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              FOLEY
                 Because you're having too much fun.

     She doesn't know what to say to that.  Foley smells the ad.

     INSIDE THE HOUSE

                              MARSHALL
                 ...She fixes him pork chops and rice,
                 the next thing you know they're making
                 love on the sofa.  She says he was
                 very gentle.

                              RAY
                 I spoke to her.  The guy told her he
                 missed his little girl and she felt
                 sorry for him.

                              MARSHALL
                 That's how you score now?

     ON THE PATIO:

     Karen looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet.

                              KAREN
                 My dad's retired.  He was a Private
                 Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to
                 work for him.

                              FOLEY
                 I can just picture that, a cute girl
                 like you following slip-and-fall and
                 whiplash cheaters.

                              KAREN
                 Something I've been wondering, what
                 ever happened to your Uncle Cully?

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  You think he might tell you where
                 I am?

                              KAREN
                 Unless you wanna tell me.

                              FOLEY
                 He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years
                 before he came out and died not too
                 long after in Charity Hospital, I think
                 trying to make up for all the good
                 times he'd missed.
                      (then)
                 That's not gonna be me.

                              KAREN
                 One last score, that the idea?  Move
                 to some island.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm partial to mountains myself.  But
                 if you like islands, we'll make it an
                 island.

                              KAREN
                 Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?

                              FOLEY
                 I just thought maybe you and me could--

     Buddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles Foley.

                              BUDDY
                 Who you talking to?

                              KAREN
                 Is that Buddy?

     Foley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone.  He looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 What?!

                              BUDDY
                 You better come see this.

     INT. MARSHALL'S CONDO - DAY

     As Karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up,
     opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room.

                              RAY
                 The woman also said he stole her
                 husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol,
                 and some of his clothes.

                              MARSHALL
                 So the woman's married.  She goes to
                 bed with this prison escapee because
                 he misses his little girl and then
                 tells the world about it.  But you
                 don't reveal her name, you protect
                 her.  It sounds like you're saying
                 it's okay as long as her husband doesn't
                 find out about it.  Like the guy who
                 cheats on his wife, saying what she
                 doesn't know won't hurt her.

                              KAREN
                 Dad.

     He looks over at her now.  Gives her an innocent look.

                              MARSHALL
                 What?

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at
     the hobo camp.  We catch a glimpse of RAY NICOLET, GUN IN HIS
     WAISTBAND, STICKING HIS CHEST OUT FOR THE CAMERA.

     Foley shakes his head as they show a shot of Lulu's body covered
     with a sheet.

                              FOLEY
                 Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

                              BUDDY
                 He's running for his life, he doesn't
                 give a shit about you.

                              FOLEY
                 He's gotta know by now that I gave him
                 up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna
                 try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele,
                 see what she knows.

                              BUDDY
                 He knows where she lives?

     Foley doesn't answer.  Buddy mutes the set.  Turns to Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 We were talking one time, drinking
                 rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how
                 she worked for a magician.  Chino got
                 interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How
                 does he saw the woman in half?  He
                 wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at
                 her if she ever came to visit.

                              BUDDY
                 So call her up.  Tell her don't talk
                 to any Cubans.

                              FOLEY
                 Her phone's probably tapped.

                              BUDDY
                 And you know they're gonna have some
                 people watching the hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S BOAT - DAY

     Karen stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints
     the trim on the boat.

                              MARSHALL
                 Remember, pay attention to how she
                 talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it
                 right, she'll tell you things she
                 wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you
                 think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell
                 her about being in the trunk with him,
                 in the dark for half an hour, and see
                 how she takes it.  If she's in on it,
                 what does she get for all the
                 aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I
                 bet nothing.  So she still likes him
                 enough to stick her neck out.  You
                 think that's possible?  What kind of
                 guy is he?

                              KAREN
                 He's pretty laid back, confident.

                              MARSHALL
                 He remind you of that guy, Tillman?

                              KAREN
                 Not at all.

                              MARSHALL
                 But you know he's dirty and you still
                 wanna see him again.

                              KAREN
                 I want to bust his ass, put him in
                 shackles.

                              MARSHALL
                 Maybe.  But you're also curious about
                 the man.  Twice last night you asked
                 your married boyfriend Nicolet about
                 him.  You were concerned, but you didn't
                 want to show it.

                              KAREN
                 My married boyfriend - setting him up
                 with that news story so you could talk
                 about infidelity.  I couldn't believe
                 it.

                              MARSHALL
                 You like the wild ones, don't you?
                 Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You
                 know, I've always said there's a thin
                 line between the cowboy cops and the
                 armed robbers, all those guys that
                 love to pack.

                              KAREN
                 Foley kidnapped me.

                              MARSHALL
                 Yeah, but you talked all the way from
                 GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more
                 like a first date than a kidnapping.
                 
     She gives him a look.  He goes back to his painting.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 Go talk to the ex-wife.

     INT. ADELE DELISI'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass-topped
     dining table and turns on the window air-conditioner when THE
     PHONE RINGS.  She grabs it...

                              ADELE
                 Hi, this is Adele speaking.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - DAY

     Adele's neighbourhood.  Near the beach.  Chino on the phone.  He
     wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit...

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is this Adele?

                              ADELE (PHONE)
                 Yes, it is.

                              CHINO
                 Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.

     He hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in
     one of his pockets.  As he then starts off down the street, we
     can see the name "COLOR MY WORLD HOUSEPAINTING" on the back of
     the jumpsuit.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     Buddy drives.  Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit --
     is beside him.  Buddy looks at him, shakes his head.

                              BUDDY
                 Nice disguise.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm a tourist.

                              BUDDY
                 You at least bring the gun?

                              FOLEY
                      (lifts straw bag)
                 In here with my suntan lotion and beach
                 towel.
                      (points)
                 That's her place.

     As they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front,
     obviously FBI...

                              BUDDY
                 There.  You see the guy sitting on the
                 porch?  The old ladies and one guy?
                 You know they'll have a couple more in
                 a car somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                      (watching something
                       else)
                 Uh-huh...

     Buddy follows Foley's gaze to...

     ACROSS THE STREET

     As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse
     for change.  She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she
     bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh...

                              BUDDY
                 Oh, my.

     Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under
     the car and grab it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you saw her.  That's all you
                 get.

     They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG
     AGENT her ID...

                              FOLEY
                 I guess Adele's in good hands.

                              BUDDY
                 Sure looks that way.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 Let's go to Detroit.

                              BUDDY
                 Now you're talkin'.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the
     narrow opening.

                              ADELE
                 You were both in the trunk?  Together?

                              KAREN
                 From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I
                 left with Glenn.

     Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up,
     heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss.

                              KAREN
                 The FBI didn't tell you I was with
                 them?

                              ADELE
                 They didn't tell me anything, they
                 asked questions.

                              KAREN
                 But you know what I'm talking about,
                 don't you?  About Glenn, don't you,
                 and the second car?

                              ADELE
                 I know a Glenn.

     She thinks a moment.  The door closes and opens again, all the
     way.  Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties,
     but no bra.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'm getting ready to go out.  You can
                 come in if you want, sit down for a
                 minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
                 
                              KAREN
                 No, thanks.

     She comes in, checks out the place.  She turns a chair from the
     glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the
     kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes.

                              ADELE
                 Those are cute shoes.  The kind of
                 jobs I get, I have to wear these killer
                 spikes, they ruin your feet.

     She walks away, comes back with an ashtray.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 When you were in the trunk with Jack...

     Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?

                              KAREN
                 You mean, did he try to jump me?  No,
                 but he was kind of talkative.

                              ADELE
                 He gets that way when he's nervous
                 sometimes.

     Adele sits down at the other end of the table.

                              KAREN
                 You didn't visit him in prison.

                              ADELE
                 He didn't want me to.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              ADELE
                 I don't know.  He was different after
                 he was sentenced, looking at thirty
                 years.  Said it depressed him every
                 time the younger cons called him an
                 old timer.

                              KAREN
                 But you spoke to him on the phone.

                              ADELE
                 He'd call every once in a while.

                              KAREN
                 He called the day he escaped.

                              ADELE
                 He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say
                 about me?  In the trunk?

                              KAREN
                      (beat, lies)
                 He said he wished the two of you could
                 start over, live a normal life.

                              ADELE
                 Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a
                 normal life is robbing banks.  It's
                 all he's ever done.

                              KAREN
                 Did you know that when you married
                 him?

                              ADELE
                 He said he was a card player.  I could
                 live with that.  I never knew he robbed
                 banks till he got busted with that car
                 that caught fire -- if you can imagine
                 something like that happening, comes
                 out of the bank and the car's on fire.
                 I did go see him in jail to tell him I
                 was filing for divorce.  He said,
                 "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.
                      (then)
                 He was fun, but never what you'd call
                 a real husband.

     Adele looks out the window.  Karen waits, looks to an end table
     where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere
     ten years back.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'll say one thing for Jack, he was
                 never ugly or mean, or drank too much.
                 He was very considerate, lights on or
                 off, if you know what I mean.

                              KAREN
                 Really.
                      (looking at the picture)
                 Hm.

     She realizes Adele is looking at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get
                 caught.  I'd like to get him before he
                 does something else, makes it worse on
                 himself.

                              ADELE
                 Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him
                 out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience.
                 Always has been.
                      (chuckles)
                 He tell you how they met?

     Karen shakes her head.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Jack came out of a bank he just robbed
                 in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen
                 car to start.  Battery was dead.  He
                 looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a
                 burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers
                 him a thousand dollars for a jump.
                 Turns out, Buddy was casing the same
                 bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy
                 says, I'll take the thousand, but we're
                 leaving in my car, not that piece of
                 shit you come in.
                      (then)
                 They musta robbed fifty banks together.

                              KAREN
                 Till they got busted.

                              ADELE
                 That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that
                 was on account of Buddy, for some
                 reason, decided to call his sister and
                 confess to a job before they'd done it
                 instead of after.  She called the FBI
                 and they both went down, ended up at
                 Lompoc.
                      (then)
                 I think Buddy felt kinda bad about
                 that.

                              KAREN
                 Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or
                 Glenn?

     Adele looks at Karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick
     raps on the door.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Adele?  You in there?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 I want to speak with you, please.

                              ADELE
                 Who is it?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 I talk to the guy you work for, Emil.
                 He tole me your number and where you
                 live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant
                 and would like to speak to you.

                              ADELE
                 Oh.  Uh-huh.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You did work for Emil, right?

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost
                 four years.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You were his what, his box?

                              ADELE
                 His assistant.

     Karen looks at the door.  Something's wrong... through the glass
     bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement
     on the other side, someone doing something...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 You say you perform in the Miami area?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in
                 Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the
                 Mayishan was my name.

     And now Karen and Adele look at each other.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Can you open the door?

     Karen shakes her head "no."

                              ADELE
                 I'm not dressed.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen to me.
                      (lowers his voice)
                 I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

     Boom.  Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of
     the table, sees Adele staring at her.

                              KAREN
                 Ask him his name.

                              ADELE
                 Who are you?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                      (beat)
                 Jose Chirino.

     Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me
                 Chino.  I'm the same person.

     Karen moves along the table to Adele...

                              KAREN
                      (soft)
                 Tell him to wait in the hall, you have
                 to get dressed.  Say it loud.

     As Adele speaks, Karen racks the slide on her 9mm.

                              ADELE
                 Wait in the hall!  I have to get
                 dressed!

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't
                 bother you no more.

     Karen motions for Adele to keep talking as she takes a position
     beside the door, where we now see Chino's silhouette in one of
     the three glass panels in the centre of the door.

                              ADELE
                 I don't know where he is.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape
                 from prison.  He tole me, I can't find
                 him to see you.  So why don't you open
                 this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can
                 speak.

                              ADELE
                      (staring at Karen)
                 Go away, or I'll call the police.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

     Adele says nothing.  Then...

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you don't want to help me, I'm
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I'm going now.  I see you maybe some
                 time, okay?  Bye bye.

                              KAREN
                      (low)
                 Go in the bedroom and --

     Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes
     through one of the glass panels.  Adele and Karen both jump as
     Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob...

     ...but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight
     as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm
     still sticking through the glass...

     ...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he
     bangs against a wall and falls to the floor.  Dazed, Chino
     reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet.

     Karen brings up her Beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the
     front sight on his chest.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Leave it where it is.

                              CHINO
                      (frowning)
                 Wait.  You not Adele?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I
                 mean, now.

                              CHINO
                 Oh.  Then this must be Adele...

     He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele.

                              KAREN
                 Put it down or I'll shoot.

                              CHINO
                 You wouldn't shoot me, would you?

                              KAREN
                 What do you want to bet?

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 I could walk out of here.

                              KAREN
                 If you move, if you look at her again,
                 you're dead.

     Chino doesn't move.  Keeps his gun on Adele.  Karen starts
     walking towards him...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You can live or die, it's up to you.

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot
                 me?  Nice girl like you?
                      (smiles)
                 I don't think so.

                              KAREN
                 You don't, huh?

     And with that, she kicks him in the knee.  Chino buckles over
     and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 On your knees.

     He does as he's told.  Karen raises his jacket, feels around
     his waist from behind.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Lie face down on the floor.

                              CHINO
                      (hurting)
                 What?!

     She kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there.  She puts
     her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials.  She
     sees Adele staring at her.

                              CHINO (CONT'D)
                      (to Adele)
                 Excuse me...

     Karen looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone...

                              KAREN
                 Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.

                              CHINO
                 Excuse me, Adele?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 You do the sawing of the box in half
                 trick with you inside?

                              ADELE
                      (beat)
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 Tell me, how do you do that?

     Adele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with
     her foot.

                              KAREN
                 Shut up.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying
                 to get a hold of you.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel.  Listen --

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Where are you?  I been trying to reach
                 you.

                              KAREN
                 I'm at Adele Delisi's.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 What-- we already talked to her.  That's
                 a dead end.

                              KAREN
                      (looking at Chino)
                 Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving.
                 Why were you trying to reach me?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around
                 the same time Foley was there.  We got
                 an address for him at the Adams Hotel
                 in Hallandale.  I want you to go there,
                 see if you can get the manager to i.d.
                 him as the other guy.  If he does, you
                 call me right away...

                              KAREN
                 All right, but...

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 But don't you do anything.  You just
                 have a seat, wait for me to get there.

                              KAREN
                 Sure, Daniel.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Now.  What is it you wanted to tell
                 me?

                              KAREN
                 Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to
                 bring in Chirino, would you put me on
                 the task force?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                      (impatient)
                 What?  Is that what you're calling me
                 about?

                              KAREN
                 Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will
                 you let me go after Foley?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in
                 Chirino, you can be on the task
                 force.

                              KAREN
                 That's all I wanted to know.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife
                 and get over to the Adams Hotel.

     Karen hangs up, looks at Adele.  Adele nods.

                              ADELE
                 You're good.

                              KAREN
                 Thank you.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing we do, we get to Detroit,
                 we find Glenn, then we find a window
                 to throw him out of.

                              BUDDY
                 I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was
                 up there to take down the Ripper, where
                 would I go?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, first off, if you were Glenn,
                 you wouldn't be thinking.

                              BUDDY
                 Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal
                 from Lompoc?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be
                 brain dead by now.

                              BUDDY
                 He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told
                 me the Snoop's been managing some guys
                 up there now, works out at the Kronk.

     INT. SHALAMAR APARTMENTS - LOBBY - NIGHT

     The ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters
     with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running
     shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags.
     Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 You get the key?

                              KAREN
                 They're in 7D.

     She hands it to him as they wait for the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 I want two men outside, front and back.
                 Conway and Jessup go on up to seven,
                 cover both ends of the hall.

     Burdon, Karen and the remaining four SWAT team agents.  Burden
     looks at them one at a time.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 You're primary, you're secondary, you're
                 point man.

                              KAREN
                 You're gonna use a ram?

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, why?

                              KAREN
                 The manager's door is metal.

     They all look at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know what I mean?  They might all be.
                 And a ram on a metal door makes an awful
                 lot of noise for what good it does.

     Burdon looks at her, not all that happy she spoke up.  The fourth
     man raises the shotgun, a three-inch strip of metal taped to
     the muzzle.

                              FOURTH MAN
                 I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun
                 oughta do the trick.

                              BURDON
                 Fine.  Whatever.

     He sees the elevator still hasn't come down.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Fuck it.  Let's take the stairs.
                 Karen...

     Burdon pauses, looks at Karen, hands her a radio.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Take the radio, stay down here in the
                 lobby, watch the elevator.

                              KAREN
                 What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.

                              BURDON
                 You can go wait out in the car, you
                 want to.

     She doesn't say anything.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg
                 come in behind us, whatta you do?

                              KAREN
                      (pissed)
                 Call and tell you.

                              BURDON
                 And you let them come up.  You don't
                 try to make the bust yourself.  You
                 understand?

     Before she can answer, an old woman steps in, asks Burdon...

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Are you delivering the oxygen?

     Burdon looks at her, then nods for his men to start up the
     stairs.

     ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY

     Everyone's in position as Burdon eases the key into the lock,
     turns it.  The door won't budge, a dead bolt holds it shut.

     The guy with the shotgun puts the strip of metal against the
     seam, where the lock enters the frame, the muzzle of the shotgun
     exactly three inches now from the dead bolt, and looks over his
     shoulder at Burdon.

     With the sound of the blast, we then...

     CUT TO:  INSIDE THE ELEVATOR - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy ride down with an old lady.  The doors open.
     The woman doesn't move.

                              BUDDY
                 Is this your floor, mother?

                              OLD LADY
                 Oh.  Yes, it is.

     INT. THE LOBBY - SAME TIME - DAY

     As an old gent in a golf cap smiles at Karen sitting there on
     the couch in front of the elevator...

                              OLD GENT
                 Like to play some gin?

                              KAREN
                 No, thank you.

     He creeps off towards the elevator.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Burdon and his men fan out through the place...

     INT. LOBBY - DAY

     As we hear Burdon's voice.

                              BURDON (RADIO)
                 Karen.  They're not up here.  Keep
                 your eyes open.

     Karen looks off towards the street entrance, then back at the
     elevator where the man is still waiting, leaning on his cane.

     The elevator door opens to reveal Buddy and Foley.

                              OLD GENT
                 Going up?

     Buddy and Foley don't answer.  The old man starts to get on,
     feeling with his cane, taking forever.

     Karen and Foley are staring at each other.  He doesn't move.
     Not until the elevator door begins to close.

     Buddy sees Karen, helps the old man aboard as...

     Karen picks up her radio, is about to speak into it when...

     Foley raises his hand.  And waves as the door closes.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     As the elevator resumes going down.

                              OLD GENT
                 Shit, I wanted to go up.

                              BUDDY
                 Let's just hope there's no one in the
                 garage.

                              FOLEY
                 She looked right at me.  She didn't
                 yell or get excited.  She didn't move.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As they get in and Buddy starts the car...

                              BUDDY
                 They know where I live, I guess they
                 know what I drive, so maybe we should
                 pick up another car on the way.

                              FOLEY
                 She just sat there, looking right at
                 me.

     Buddy gives him a look, shakes his head and then burns rubber
     out of the garage as we...

     CUT TO: A CLOSE-UP OF KAREN - DAY

     Staring straight ahead.

                              BURDON (ON THE RADIO)
                 Karen.  Report.  You see anything?
                 Karen?  You there?  Karen...?

     INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

     As Marshall walks Karen to the gate.

                              MARSHALL
                 He waved to you?

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty
                 sure he did.

                              MARSHALL
                 You wave back?

                              KAREN
                 I didn't have time.

                              MARSHALL
                 I imagine you would've though.

     She shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got
                 two calls from Buddy up in Detroit
                 this morning, called Burdon.  She's
                 also the one gave Burdon Buddy's
                 address.

                              MARSHALL
                 So?

                              KAREN
                 So what I want to know is why Buddy
                 still calls his sister every week even
                 after she turned him in.

                              MARSHALL
                 He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
                      (then)
                 What I want to know is why, they got
                 such a big score up north, did Foley
                 hang around Miami for so long?
                      (looks at her)
                 Any thoughts on that one?

                              KAREN
                 None I'd like to share.

     She gives him a kiss...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'll call soon as I get in.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - DETROIT - DAY

     Snow.  Everywhere.  A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the
     neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes.

                              MAURICE (VO)
                 I don't just manage fighters, or deal
                 product any more...

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Glenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka "Snoopy" --
     wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses.

                              MAURICE
                 I've diversified since the last time
                 you saw me.  I've vertically integrated
                 and now I'm into home invasions and
                 the occasional grand larceny.

     Glenn just nods, stares out the window.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my
                 bodyguard when I feel I need one, and
                 my driver.

     Maurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved-
     looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Watch the road, boy.
                      (then)
                 I like this Town Car.  We can cruise
                 the man's neighbourhood without getting
                 the police or private security people
                 on our ass.

                              GLENN
                 Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving
                 around a black guy wearing shades and
                 a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they
                 won't think anything of it.

                              MAURICE
                 It's lilac, man, the color, and the
                 style's made known by Deion and other
                 defensive backs in the pros.  I could
                 be one of them living out here with
                 doctors of my race and basketball
                 players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's
                 house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick
                 wall.  There's his drive, right there.

     The car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming
                 up here, do this themself?

                              GLENN
                 If they're not busted now, they're
                 gonna be.
                      (then)
                 It's wide open.

     EXT./INT. CAR - MAURICE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DETROIT - LATER

     People on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black
     Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and
     snow-covered trash.

                              GLENN
                 So you still haven't said, how you
                 wanna do it?

                              MAURICE
                 I'll show you, soon as I get one more
                 guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother,
                 Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.

                              GLENN
                 What?

     The car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a
     bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always
     seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in.

                              MAURICE
                 You get everything?

     Kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat.  Glenn stares at
     it.  Something about the bag makes him uneasy.  Maybe it's the
     HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Cool.  Kenneth, this is the man I told
                 you about, Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 The one gonna help us rip off the rich
                 guy?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              GLENN
                 Help you...

     White Boy Bob pulls out again.  Glenn looks at the two psychos
     in front, then turns to Maurice.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on
                 this, not all your friends.

                              MAURICE
                 You just ask me how we gonna do it.
                 That's what I'm here for, tell you
                 how.  We the experts.

     Glenn can't believe this is happening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Thing I'm worried about is you.

                              GLENN
                 Me?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah.  If you can step up and actually
                 do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just
                 talking the talk.

                              GLENN
                 Can I do what?

                              MAURICE
                 Walk in a house with me, do this cross-
                 dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I
                 used to sell to been dealin' on his
                 own.

                              GLENN
                 What-- when?

                              MAURICE
                 Right now, son.

                              GLENN
                 I don't have to prove shit to you.
                 The Ripley job is my job.  You're either
                 in or you're not.  You wanna pop some
                 crack dealer pissed you off, that's
                 your problem, not mine.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you
                 don't have to give me no tone of voice,
                 okay?  You don't like what I'm saying,
                 you can get out anywhere along here
                 you want.

                              GLENN
                 I think you're forgetting, this is my
                 car.  I drove it up here.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this
                 car, man, it's mine.  You go get
                 yourself another one.  I say I'm in on
                 Ripley?  I'm in, with or without your
                 ass.  I say I want you to come along
                 on another job, see if you for real or
                 not, guess what you gonna do?

     Glenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We're here.

     Glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit-
     looking two-story house.  Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the
     hack saw and a HAND AXE up to White Boy Bob, a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN
     to Kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go see Eddie.

     Glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear...

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 Must take balls, do what you do.

     EXT. LOMPOC FPC - YARD - DAY

     As Foley walks with Ripley across the yard.

                              RIPLEY
                 Tell me something.  What's it like,
                 walk in a bank with a gun, stick it
                 up?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I never used a gun.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?

                              FOLEY
                 You'd be surprised what all you can
                 get, you ask for it the right way.

                              RIPLEY
                      (smiles)
                 You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep
                 all my money in banks.

                              FOLEY
                 No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?
                      (Ripley smiles)
                 I'm talking about all those uncut
                 diamonds you told Glenn about.

                              RIPLEY
                      (still smiling)
                 I know what you're talking about.

                              FOLEY
                 You're the one with balls, Dick, say
                 something like that to someone like
                 Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where
                 you were for a minute.

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn?
                 I mean, do you believe Glenn?

                              FOLEY
                 Of course not.

                              RIPLEY
                 Plus, even it was true, he'd still
                 have to figure out where I keep 'em.

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You
                 told him you keep 'em at your house.

                              RIPLEY
                      (shrugs, big smile)
                 It's a big house.

     Ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the
     yard.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Tell me something, Jack, how much longer
                 you in here?

                              FOLEY
                 Twenty-two months, three days, two
                 hours.  Why?

                              RIPLEY
                 I was just thinking that I could use a
                 guy like you, someone knows how to ask
                 for things the right way.  I'm talkin'
                 about when you're outta here.  I mean,
                 you can't rob banks for ever.

     Foley looks at Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a little late for me.

                              RIPLEY
                 Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make
                 my first million until I was forty-
                 two.  Forty-two.  You really want to
                 change, it's never too late.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I'm not exactly the
                 nine-to-five type.

                              RIPLEY
                 Who is?  But then you gotta look at a
                 job as more than just work.  You gotta
                 look at it as peace of mind.  As
                 security, you know what I mean?  I got
                 offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston,
                 take your pick.

                              FOLEY
                 My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down
                 there.

                              RIPLEY
                 No need to decide now.  Be like the
                 fish.  Let whatever happens happen.

                              FOLEY
                 The fish?

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, fish live in the present.  They
                 don't dwell on yesterday and they don't
                 worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big
                 fish attacks a little fish, there's no
                 neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward.
                 No whining on some fish-shrink's couch.
                 They just do it.  They accept.

                              FOLEY
                 I can't say that I've paid that much
                 attention to 'em before.

                              RIPLEY
                 The fish saved my life.  Two years
                 ago, I found out I had high blood
                 pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me
                 to go get an aquarium, look at the
                 fish every time I felt myself stressing
                 out.

                              FOLEY
                 And the guy sent you a bill for this?

                              RIPLEY
                 It works.  You should try it sometime.

                              FOLEY
                 The next time I walk into a bank.

     Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...

                              RIPLEY
                 Think about my offer, Jack.

     Foley watches him go.

                              BUDDY (V.O.)
                 Hey, Jack...

     CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF FOLEY

     As he turns to us.

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR

     Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red-
     brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.

                              BUDDY
                 You see this one...

     Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 "Fight over tuna casserole may have
                 spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's
                 live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
                 complained about her tuna noodle
                 casserole and she shot him in the face
                 with a twelve-gauge.  Police found
                 noodles in the woman's hair and think
                 the guy dumped the casserole dish on
                 her before she shot him.  They'd been
                 together ten years.

                              FOLEY
                 Love is funny.

     Buddy looks at him.  Notices something over Foley's shoulder.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey--

     And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car
     pulls into the Kronk parking lot.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

     Kenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the
     front seat.  Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging
     himself, shaking.  Maurice looks out the window...

                              MAURICE
                 Was a time you see a gold Mercedes
                 over in the parking lot has a license
                 plate on it say HITMAN?  You know Tommy
                 Hearns is inside.  Seeing the car would
                 get our juices flowing.

     Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You already got your juices flowing,
                 huh?  Pissed your pants back there at
                 Eddie's house, didn't you?

     Glenn just looks at Maurice.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That was some shit, huh?

                              GLENN
                      (indicates Kenneth)
                 Why'd he have to do that to that girl?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that
                 to that poor girl.

                              KENNETH
                      (smiles)
                 Do what?

     Glenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth.

                              MAURICE
                 Just wait till we get inside Ripley's
                 house.

     And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car.

                              GLENN
                 It's all right with you, I'll just
                 hang in the car.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 No.  You gonna stay close to me from
                 now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

                              GLENN
                 Why would I do that?

     Maurice looks at him, starts laughing.  White Boy Bob and Kenneth
     join in.  Maurice leans over... Glenn flinches as Maurice opens
     Glenn's jacket so that we can see the BLOOD splattered on his T-
     shirt.

                              MAURICE
                 Was worse than you imagined, wasn't
                 it?
                      (then, smiles)
                 Baby, you with the bad boys now.

     INT. FOLEY AND BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the
     car.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you think?

                              FOLEY
                 I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
                 now we got us another partner.

                              BUDDY
                 Or two.

     INT. BOXING GYM - DAY

     Glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring.
     Kenneth grabs a magazine, walks into the john.  A shirtless
     White Boy Bob lifts weights while Maurice moves around the ring
     calling to the boxers inside.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab!

                              VOICE
                 Hey, Studs, how you doing?

     He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing
                 here?

     They sit down on either side of him, close.

                              FOLEY
                 Weren't you expecting us?

                              GLENN
                 That broad you picked up -- did you
                 know she was a US Marshal, for Christ
                 sake?

     Now he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat
     and sits down again.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 She knew me from some bullshit dope
                 bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice.
                 You know what she said, we're in the
                 car on the turnpike?  "I never forget
                 anybody I've cuffed and shackled."

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  She said that to you?

     Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face,
     almost smiling.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 What happened to your shades?  Someone
                 finally step on 'em?

                              GLENN
                      (touches his head)
                 I don't know...

     Foley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 Whose blood you got all over you?

                              GLENN
                 These guys, man, they're crazy.
                      (looks off)
                 Shit.

     Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy
     Bob beside him, carrying his shirts.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo
                 rag?

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now, tell fortunes?

     Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley
     to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We have a problem here?

                              MAURICE
                      (walking over)
                 Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

                              MAURICE
                 It seems to me I been reading about
                 you in the newspaper.  Busted out of
                 some joint in Florida, huh?

                              FOLEY
                 Low class of people there, Snoop.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You call him that again I'll put your
                 head through the wall.

                              BUDDY
                 What?  You mean Snoop?

                              MAURICE
                 Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy,
                 is what White Boy's trying to say.
                 He's a little crude, you understand.
                 No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me.

                              BUDDY
                 But you call this bozo White Boy?

                              GLENN
                 White Boy Bob.
                      (baiting)
                 White Boy used to be a fighter.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now outside of shoot his
                 mouth off?

     White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit.

                              FOLEY
                 Like being back in the yard, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Just like it.  Nobody backing down.
                 You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what
                 you and Buddy doing up here in the
                 cold?

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn didn't tell you?

                              GLENN
                 I thought you guys were busted.

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  Just because you left us standing
                 on the side of the road?

     Foley looks at Glenn.  Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously.  Foley
     smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard.  Now Maurice
     starts laughing.  Buddy, too.  White Boy's lost, looking from
     one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile
     going away as he says...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn
                 promised you or what you think you're
                 gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy
                 get half of whatever we take from
                 Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn
                 cut up the rest is up to you.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go outside and talk.

                              FOLEY
                 What's the matter with right here?
                 It's nice and warm.

                              MAURICE
                 Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees
                 in here, sometimes a hundred -- the
                 way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd
                 sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy
                 Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any
                 business in here.  To me this is holy
                 ground, man.  You understand?  I got
                 to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to
                 talk, come to the fights tomorrow night,
                 we'll sit down and look at it good.
                 The State Theater.

     Foley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll see you tomorrow then.

     Maurice then watches as they walk out.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, how much is the reward on
                 the man again?

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Ten gees.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.
                      (then)
                 You recall, did it say dead or alive?

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier.
     Now it's a CRIME SCENE.  A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers
     stand just behind the yellow tape.  A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up
     the front yard.

     Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly-
     freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control.

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Ray Cruz.

                              COP
                 He's inside.
                      (pissed)
                 With everybody else.

     Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk.  She pauses
     to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD
     BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window.

     INT. HOUSE - SAME

     Hell.  Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in
     the doorway.  Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A
     MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the
     chest.  He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist.

     Congealed blood runs down the stairs.  COPS and CRIME SCENE
     TECHS are everywhere.  Karen looks at the guy on the stairs.

                              VOICE
                 Called themselves the Youngboys.

     Karen looks over as RAYMOND CRUZ, a stocky, genial-looking
     detective comes out of the kitchen.

                              CRUZ
                 Ironic, isn't it?

                              KAREN
                 How are you, Raymond?

                              CRUZ
                 Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.

     He kisses her on the cheek.  She indicates the body by the door.

                              KAREN
                 Quite a mess.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked
                 Eddie.

                              KAREN
                 Who?

                              CRUZ
                 Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon,
                 used to buy scag off a corner till he
                 kicked it and found his happiness with
                 crack and then started dealing himself.
                 Word on the street was he was saving
                 up for an operation.

                              KAREN
                 What is it with crack and transsexuals?

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had
                 these girls cooked the rocks he called
                 the Rockettes.

                              KAREN
                 Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.

                              CRUZ
                 Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped
                 her, shot her, then threw her out the
                 window.
                      (shakes his head)
                 Fuckin' animals.

     This shuts them both up.  Cruz indicates the door.

                              CRUZ (CONT'D)
                 Let's get some air.

     She starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on
     the ground...

     A BROKEN PAIR OF SUNGLASSES

     Wrap-around... a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing.
     Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out.

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     As Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press
     photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene.

                              CRUZ
                 Other than we had so much fun the last
                 time we worked together.  You gonna
                 tell me why you're comin' to me instead
                 of the FBI?

                              KAREN
                 I report to the FBI, first thing they're
                 gonna do is ask me to go get some
                 coffee.

                              CRUZ
                 You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

                              KAREN
                 No, I didn't know that.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and
                 property now, also sex crimes and child
                 abuse.

                              KAREN
                 Detroit, you must be pretty busy.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions
                 are big, too.

                              KAREN
                 Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had
                 this guy Glenn Michaels on possession
                 with intent but couldn't make it stick.
                 In his statement, Glenn said he went
                 up to Detroit to visit a friend and
                 look into job opportunities -- if you
                 can believe that.

                              CRUZ
                 Who was the friend?

                              KAREN
                 Guy named Maurice Miller, also known
                 as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.

                              CRUZ
                 Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a
                 fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray
                 Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other
                 Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.

                              KAREN
                 I'll need a last known address.

                              CRUZ
                 That's fine, but I don't want you to
                 talk to Miller alone.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer,
                 I'm armed.

     He turns and looks at her.

                              CRUZ
                 Yes, you are.  I'll call you tomorrow
                 with the address.

     As he gets into his car, we then:

     CUT TO: A NEWSPAPER

     The crime scene from the night before.  A shot of Karen and Ray
     Cruz as they exit the house.  A headline reads "TRIPLE MURDER"
     blah-blah-blah...

                              BUDDY (PHONE)
                 You have the paper?

     REVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the
     newspaper photograph of Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a terrific shot of her.

     INT. BUDDY'S ROOM - SAME

     Buddy looking at the same shot...

                              BUDDY
                 Outside of that.

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & BUDDY

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't say what she's doing up here,
                 but I don't think it has anything to
                 do with us.

                              BUDDY
                 She came up here on her vacation, 'cause
                 she likes shitty weather.

     Foley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center
     and pulls out a tie.

                              FOLEY
                 I think she's after Glenn.  The girl
                 still with you?

                              BUDDY
                 They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less
                 you pay for it.

                              FOLEY
                 You tell your sister about it?

                              BUDDY
                 Just hung up.

                              FOLEY
                 How long you talk to her?

                              BUDDY
                 Two hours.

                              FOLEY
                 How long were you with the girl?

                              BUDDY
                 Forty-five minutes.

                              FOLEY
                 You didn't tell your sister about
                 Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna
                 go through that again.

                              BUDDY
                 Forget about my sister.  If Karen
                 Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked.
                 Tomorrow night at the fights we all
                 get picked up.

                              FOLEY
                 Let's drive by where we're meeting and
                 have a look.  Maybe take a look at
                 Ripley's place while we're at it.

     Foley hangs up.  He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie.

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 I guess next time I see you, you'll be
                 wearing a suit and tie...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - DAY

     Foley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a
     jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of A GUARD, gathers up
     his belongings.  He's going home.

                              FOLEY
                 I still haven't made up my mind yet.

                              RIPLEY
                 What's to think about?

                              FOLEY
                 You goin' right back to work?

                              RIPLEY
                 First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year,
                 study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz...
                 then come back, maybe take some tennis
                 lessons.

     He tears a picture off the wall...

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here...
                      (hands it to Foley)
                 Something to remember me by.

     Foley stares at the photograph of sea life.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 It's not the real thing, but it's still
                 nice to look at.

     Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 See you on the outside, Jack.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in
     the overall effect.

                              FOLEY
                      (smiles)
                 Hi!  I just broke outta jail!

     His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at
     the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside,
     grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone...

                              VOICE (PHONE)
                 Atheneum Hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen Sisco, please.

                              VOICE
                      (pause, then)
                 I'm sorry, but there's no one by that
                 name registered.

                              FOLEY
                 Thank you.

     He dials the next number...

                              VOICE
                 Best Western...

     EXT. MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Red brick, showing its age.  Karen rings the doorbell and then
     waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy
     coat.  The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe
     holding her arms close against the cold.

                              KAREN
                 Moselle Miller?

                              MOSELLE
                 What do you want?

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 You find him, tell him the dog got run
                 over and I'm out of grocery money.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Moselle.  Who you talking to?

                              MOSELLE
                 Lady looking for Maurice.

                              MALE VOICE
                 What's she want?

                              MOSELLE
                 Hasn't said.

                              KAREN
                 That's not Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's
                 talking on the phone.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Ask what she want with him?

                              MOSELLE
                 You ask her.  Maurice's business is
                 none of my business.

     Sounding tired or bored.  She turns from the door and walks
     into the living room.  Karen steps inside, pushes the door
     closed and steps into the foyer.

                              MALE VOICE
                 How do I know?

     Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and
     sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on
     the phone...

                              KENNETH
                 The State, huh.  Who's fighting?

     Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa
     lighting a cigarette.

                              MOSELLE
                 You like to sit down?

                              KAREN
                 Thanks.

     Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray
     daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the
     fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm looking for a friend of mine I think
                 Maurice knows.

                              MOSELLE
                 You not with probation, one of those?

                              KAREN
                 No.

                              MOSELLE
                 You a lawyer?

                              KAREN
                      (smiles)
                 No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him.
                 Glenn Michaels?

     Moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke.

                              MOSELLE
                 Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed here last November.

                              MOSELLE
                 Here?  In this house?

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed with Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 Well, he ain't even here that much.  I
                 like to know where he goes, but at the
                 same time I don't want to know, you
                 understand?

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Your dog was killed?

                              MOSELLE
                 Got run over by a car.

                              KAREN
                 What did you call it?

     Moselle looks at the couch, where a MANGLED FRISBEE sits.

                              MOSELLE
                 Was a she, name Tuffy.

                              KAREN
                      (nods, then)
                 Where do you think I might find Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 I don't know -- the gym, the fights.
                 I know he don't miss the fights.  Having
                 some tomorrow night at the State
                 Theater.  He use to take me.

                              KAREN
                 The State Theater?

                              VOICE
                 What you want with Maurice?

     Karen turns, sees Kenneth standing in the arched entrance from
     the foyer.

                              MOSELLE
                 She looking for a man name of Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 Did I ask you?  Go on out of here.  Do
                 something with yourself.

     He waits until Moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away
     from them through the dining room.  Karen watches him come toward
     her now in kind of an easy strut.  She indicates the scar over
     his eye...

                              KAREN
                 You're a fighter?

                              KENNETH
                 How you know that?

                              KAREN
                 I can tell.

                              KENNETH
                 I was...

     He moves his head in what might be a feint.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Till I got my retina detached two time.

     He's standing so close to her, Karen has to look up at him.

                              KAREN
                 What'd you fight, middleweight?

                              KENNETH
                 Light to super-middleweight, as my
                 body developed.  You go about what,
                 bantam?

                              KAREN
                 Flyweight.

                              KENNETH
                 You know your divisions.  You like the
                 fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah,
                 I bet you do.
                      (moves closer)
                 Like to get down and tussle a little
                 bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she
                 got run over, we use to get down on
                 the floor and tussle.  I say to her,
                 "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat
                 for you."  And I give Tuffy what every
                 dog love best.  You know what that is?
                 A bone.
                      (real close)
                 I can give you a bone, too, girl.

                              KAREN
                 You're not my type.

                              KENNETH
                 Don't matter.  I let the monster out,
                 you gonna do what it wants.

                              KAREN
                 Just a minute.

     Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.

                              KENNETH
                 Bring your own rubbers with you?

     Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip
     on a golf club.  Kenneth grins at her...

                              KENNETHN (CONT'D)
                 What else you have in there, mace?
                 Have a whistle, different kinds of
                 female-protection shit?

     Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face.

                              KAREN
                 I have to go, Kenneth.

     She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's
     like a golf club grip.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?

     She steps aside and brushes past him.  He grabs her left wrist...

                              KENNETH
                 We gonna tussle first.

     Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots
     out of the grip.  She pulls an arm's length away from him and
     chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking
     away...

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 God damn...

     He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that
     when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of
     his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 What's wrong with you?

                              KAREN
                 You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

     And she walks out.  She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer.
     Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and
     comes out with a business card.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wrote my hotel number on there -- in
                 case you run into Glenn.

     Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.  Karen smiles
     at her and walks out the door.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - DAY

     It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     Buddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see
     the house.

                              BUDDY
                 Now that's a really big house.

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost
                 looks like a prison.

                              BUDDY
                 No doubt the man's got some big-ass
                 security system.

                              FOLEY
                 Time comes, we knock on the door.  See
                 if he wants to talk about old times.
                 Go in the easy way.

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we
                 got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole
                 with us?

                              FOLEY
                 Who says anybody's gonna be with us?
                 I say we go to the fights tomorrow,
                 find out what the Snoop's big plan is,
                 then go in ahead of those guys --
                 alone.

                              BUDDY
                 Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while
                 we're off livin' the good life.

                              FOLEY
                 Tell me something, Buddy.  You know
                 anyone who's actually done one last
                 big score and gone to live the good
                 life?  Cause it occurred to me that
                 everyone talks about doing it, but I
                 don't know anyone who's actually gone
                 and done it.  Do you?

                              BUDDY
                      (beat)
                 What about that D.B. Cooper guy?

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I mean, they don't know for sure he's
                 dead.
                      (then)
                 Look, there's always a chance we'll
                 walk out've there with nothing.  I say
                 let fate decide.

                              FOLEY
                 Let fate decide?  What're you, the
                 fuckin' Dali Lama now?

                              BUDDY
                 My sister believes in fate, but not
                 hell.  That's why she stopped praying
                 for the lost souls since you don't
                 hear that much about purgatory anymore.
                 But every day she asks her boss to
                 pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think,
                 you think there's a hell, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional
                 Institution and I'm sure as shit not
                 going back there or any place like it.

                              BUDDY
                 You might not have a choice.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They put a gun on you, you'll go back.

                              FOLEY
                 They put a gun on you, you still have
                 a choice, don't you?

     Foley turns back to the house.  And now we hear...

                              MR. HEARN (VO)
                 I think you're gonna fit right in...

     INT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY

     The personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a
     grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty
     suit and tie.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long
                 discussion about your role in the
                 company and it was his feeling that
                 you would be happiest working down
                 here in Miami.  How's that sound to
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 Great.

     Mr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley...

                              MR. HEARN
                 You're about a 42 long, right?

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     But Mr. Hearn walks out without answering.  Foley looks at the
     desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the-
     bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar.

     Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with
     it.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Okay.  Let's see how she fits.

     Foley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what
     looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm.

                              FOLEY
                 What is this?

                              MR. HEARN
                 Your uniform.

                              FOLEY
                 My what?

     Mr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one
     arm.  Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Are you kidding me?

     RICHARD RIPLEY'S OFFICE

     View.  Wet bar.  Huge fucking aquarium.

                              RECEPTIONIST (OS)
                 Sir, you can't go in there...

     Ripley looks up from his desk as Foley steps in, the receptionist
     right behind him now.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack?  Whoa-- what's the problem?
                 Take it easy, let's talk...

     Meanwhile, Ripley pushes a PANIC BUTTON beneath his desk...

                              FOLEY
                 A security guard?  Are you fucking
                 kidding me?

     Ripley considers Foley a moment, then...

                              RIPLEY
                 You know, I wasn't sure you'd show up.
                 But I was pretty sure that, if you
                 did, you'd throw the job in my face.
                      (then)
                 Understand something, Jack.  Up to
                 this point, everything you've done
                 with your life means absolutely nothing
                 in the real world.  Less than nothing.

     Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're a bank robber.  This is not a
                 marketable skill.  There are no old
                 bank robbers out in the world living
                 on pensions.  You know this.  That's
                 why you're here right now.
                 
     Still Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at
                 a lousy wage.  You think you're better
                 than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me
                 that you're really willing to change
                 and we'll talk about something better.
                 A lot better.  But first, Jack, you
                 gotta earn it.

                              FOLEY
                 How, Dick?  The way you earned it?  By
                 marrying some rich broad owns the
                 company, selling it off a piece at a
                 time, then divorcing her?  What is
                 this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by
                 the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in
                 prison, guy like you, place like that,
                 you were ice cream for freaks.  You
                 were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and
                 a dozen other guys coulda bled you
                 till you had nothing.  Till you were
                 nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll
                 pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a
                 fuckin stool all day saying "sign in
                 here please" or "hey, pal, you can't
                 park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do
                 it.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I
                 misjudged you.

     Two massive SECURITY GUARDS appear in the doorway...

                              FOLEY
                 Hey, what job he promise you guys?

                              GUARD
                 There's two ways we can do this.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  What are they?

                              RIPLEY
                 Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down
                 now.  Haven't we, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally
                 "relaxed..."

     And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH) and wings
     it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S BUILDING - FLORIDA - DAY

     As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two
     guards.  He picks himself up.  He kicks at the guards, who wave
     him off, go back inside.

     Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees...

     THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     The one from the opening.  Foley looks at it a moment, then
     calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he
     starts across the street...

                                                             CUT TO:

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As Buddy pulls away from the house, Foley pulls out the clipping of
     Karen he tore out of the morning paper.  He's written the name 
     "WESTIN" on it.

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, I gotta get some better shoes,
                 few other things before tomorrow.  Why
                 don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen,
                 we'll hook up later?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, and I better call my sister.

     CUT TO: THE SNOWSTORM

     It's really coming down.  We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're
     looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of
     the Westin.

     A table of three young EXECUTIVE-LOOKING GUYS in suits are
     laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a WAITRESS to
     an adjacent table.

                              KAREN
                 Jack Daniel's, please, water on the
                 side.

     She turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast
     sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above
     the city, down there somewhere.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY'S VOICE
                 Celeste, do us again, please, and put
                 the lady's drink on our bill.

     She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling,
     pleasant-looking guys in dark suits.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks anyway.

                              WAITRESS
                      (drifting over)
                 They want to buy you a drink.

                              KAREN
                 I get that.  Tell them I'd rather pay
                 for my own.

     She then watches the three guys looking at the waitress
     delivering the message.  Then they look at Karen.  She gives
     them a shrug, turns to watch the snow.  Her drink arrives.  She
     takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over...

                              EXECUTIVE GUY
                 Excuse me.  My associates and I made a
                 bet on what you do for a living.

     She glances at the table, the other two watching.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY (CONT'D)
                 And I won.  Hi, I'm Philip.

                              KAREN
                 If it's okay with you, Philip, I'd
                 like to just have a quiet drink and
                 leave.  Okay?

                              PHILIP
                 Don't you want to know what I guessed?
                 How I know what you do for a living?

                              KAREN
                 Tell you the truth, I'm not even mildly
                 curious.  Really, I don't want to be
                 rude, Philip, I'd just like to be left
                 alone.

     She turns back to the snowstorm.  She sees his reflection turn
     and leave.  A moment later, the next one appears at the table.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2
                 I think I know why you're depressed --
                 if I may offer an observation.

     She just looks at him.  So sure of himself.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2 (CONT'D)
                 I have a hunch you're the new sales
                 rep and your customer isn't exactly
                 knocked out by the idea of a young
                 lady, even one as stunning as you,
                 handling the account.  Am I close?
                 Hi, I'm Andy.

     She says nothing to him.

                              ANDY
                 We're ad guys.  We flew in from New
                 York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker
                 Distillery, present this test-market
                 campaign for their new margarita mix.
                 What we do, we show this guy who looks
                 like a Mexican bandido, you know, with
                 the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts--

                              KAREN
                 Andy?  Really.  Who gives a shit?

     He gives her a sympathetic expression.

                              ANDY
                 Want to tell me what happened?

                              KAREN
                 Beat it, will you?

     She stares at the guy until he turns away.  She sips her drink,
     stares once more out at the blizzard.  After a few moments,
     another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.

                              VOICE
                 Can I buy you a drink?

     Boom.  Not one of the executive guys.  She stares at the
     reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK
     FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, I'd love one.
                      (then)
                 Would you like to sit down?

     He pulls the chair out, looking at her.  The three guys at the
     other table now staring as he sits down.  Foley offers his
     hand...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm Gary.

     She hesitates, then shakes his hand...

                              KAREN
                 I'm Celeste.

     She smiles with him.  When she lowers her hand to the table,
     his hand comes down to cover hers.  She watches his expression
     as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers,
     and lays her hand on his.  The tips of her fingers brush his
     knuckles, lightly back and forth.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It takes hours to get a drink around
                 here.  There's only one waitress.

                              FOLEY
                 I can go to the bar.

                              KAREN
                 Don't leave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Those guys bother you?

                              KAREN
                 No, they're all right.  I meant, you
                 just got here.

     She picks up her drink and places it in front of him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Help yourself.

     She watches him take a sip, smack his lips.

                              FOLEY
                 You like bourbon?

                              KAREN
                 Love it.

                              FOLEY
                      (passes the glass
                       back)
                 Well, we got that out of the way.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for
                 a living?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call
                 on a customer and they gave me a hard
                 time because I'm a girl.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that how you think of yourself?

                              KAREN
                 What, as a sales rep?

                              FOLEY
                 A girl.

                              KAREN
                 I don't have a problem with it.

                              FOLEY
                 I like your hair.  And that suit.

                              KAREN
                 I had one just like it -- well, it was
                 the same idea, but I had to get rid of
                 it.

                              FOLEY
                 You did?

                              KAREN
                 It smelled.

                              FOLEY
                 Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?

                              KAREN
                 No.
                      (then)
                 What do you do for a living, Gary?

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 How far do we go with this?

     This stops her, throws her off balance.

                              KAREN
                 Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think it works if we're somebody
                 else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and
                 Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about
                 anything?

                              KAREN
                 It's your game.  I've never played
                 this before.

                              FOLEY
                 It's not a game.  Something you play.

                              KAREN
                 Well, does it make sense to you?

                              FOLEY
                 It doesn't have to, it's something
                 that happens.  It's like seeing a person
                 you never saw before -- you could be
                 passing on the street -- you look at
                 each other and for a few seconds,
                 there's a kind of recognition.  Like
                 you both know something.  But then the
                 next moment the person's gone, and
                 it's too late to do anything about it,
                 but you remember it because it was
                 right there and you let it go, and you
                 think, "What if I had stopped and said
                 something?"  It might happen only a
                 few times in your life.

                              KAREN
                 Or once.

     They look at each other a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 Why don't we get out of here.

     They both get up.  The ad guys at the table watch as she follows
     Foley to the elevator.  Karen winks at them.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     As they ride down to Karen's room.  She looks at him, looks
     away.  The doors open and they exit.

     INT. HER HOTEL SUITE

     As he follows her in.  She walks to the bar, fixes them each a
     drink.  He checks out the room, takes in her view.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you find me?

     He comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her
     picture and shows it to her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Oh, God...

                              FOLEY
                 I called your room from downstairs.

                              KAREN
                 If I had answered, what were you gonna
                 say?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, I'd say who I was and do you
                 remember me and ask if you'd like to
                 meet for a drink.

                              KAREN
                 If I remembered you.  I came looking
                 for you.  I would've said sure, let's
                 do it.  But for all you knew I could
                 show up with a SWAT team.  Why would
                 you trust me?

                              FOLEY
                 It would be worth the risk.

     She looks at him, touches his face with her hand...

                              KAREN
                 You like taking risks.

                              FOLEY
                 So do you.

     He kisses her now, puts his arms around her.

                              KAREN
                 What's the hurry, Jack?  You have to
                 be somewhere?

     She hands him his drink.  They both drink, then...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Sooner or later...

     She stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You really wear that suit.

                              FOLEY
                 That's not what you were about to say.

     She shrugs, lets it go.  He puts down his drink, kisses her.
     She lets him, then moves to the couch.

                              KAREN
                 Remember how talkative you were?  In
                 the trunk?  Adele said you do that
                 when you're nervous.

                              FOLEY
                 She did, huh.

                              KAREN
                 You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but in a nice way.

     He sits down and they kiss again.  This time she peels his jacket
     off.  He does the same with hers.  He's starting to unbutton
     her blouse when--

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                      (unbuttoning)
                 I might've smelled like a sewer, but
                 you could tell I was a gentleman.
                 They say John Dillinger was a pretty
                 nice guy.

                              KAREN
                 He killed a police officer.

     He stops.  Looks at her.

                              FOLEY
                 I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop
                 fell as Dillinger was aiming at his
                 leg and got him through the heart.

                              KAREN
                 You believe that?

                              FOLEY
                 Why not?

     She looks at him, decides to get off this subject.  Anyway he's
     finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands
     inside her shirt.  She closes her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 You know that Sig .380 you took was my
                 favourite.  My father gave it to me.

     As he kisses her on the neck.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 What were you gonna do with me?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I hadn't worked that
                 part out yet.  All I knew was that I
                 liked you, and I didn't want to leave
                 you there, never see you again.

                              KAREN
                 You waved to me in the elevator.

     She's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't sure you caught that.

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking
                 of you by then, a lot, wondering what
                 it would be like if we did meet.  Like
                 if we could take a time-out...

                              FOLEY
                 Really?  I was thinking the same thing.
                 If we could call time and get together
                 for a while.

     They look at each other a moment.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You know I saw you on the street.

                              KAREN
                 Where?

                              FOLEY
                 Outside Adele's.

     He starts to kiss her again, but--

                              KAREN
                 You were going to see her?

                              FOLEY
                 To warn her about Chino.

                              KAREN
                 So she did help you?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think we should get into that.

                              KAREN
                 No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't
                 ask if he's with you or what you're
                 doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've
                 run into Glenn Michaels yet.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare
                 me.

     And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.

                              KAREN
                 Come on.

     He gets up and she leads him across the room...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to
     take off his pants.

                              KAREN
                 Are you gonna leave your tie on?

     He looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she
     gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him,
     standing close to help him with the tie...

                              FOLEY
                 My God, look at you.

     When her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck
     again and then as she turns off the light...

     She kisses him.  He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with
     him, the only light now coming from the sitting room.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You having fun?

     She smiles and then they start to make love as we then...

     FADE OUT.

     CUT TO: KAREN

     Eyes open, serious now.

     REVEAL

     She's lying in Jack's arms.  She looks at him a moment, then
     moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.

                              FOLEY
                 You coming back?

                              KAREN
                 I'm just going to the bathroom.

     She gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the
     door.  Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     She comes in.  Looks at herself in the mirror.  Suddenly
     feels self-conscious.  She grabs a bathrobe off the door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the
     ceiling.  She comes out again and stands looking down at him.

                              KAREN
                 I want you to know something.  I wasn't
                 looking for just a fuck, if that's
                 what you're thinking.

                              FOLEY
                 Why are you mad?

                              KAREN
                 Or I did it for some kind of kinky
                 thrill.  Score with a bank robber the
                 way some women go for rough trade.

                              FOLEY
                 What about my motive?  Now I can say I
                 fucked a US Marshal.  You think I
                 will?

                              KAREN
                 I don't know.

     He raises the covers, but she just stands there.

                              FOLEY
                 I know of a guy he goes in the bank
                 holding a bottle he says is
                 nitroglycerin.  He scores some cash
                 off a teller, he's on his way out when
                 he drops the bottle.  It shatters on
                 the tile floor, he slips in the stuff,
                 cracks his head and they've got him.
                 The nitro was canola oil.  I know more
                 fucked-up bank robbers than ones that
                 know what they're doing.  I doubt one
                 in ten can tell a dye pack when he
                 sees one.  Most bank robbers are fucking
                 morons.  To go to bed with a bank robber
                 for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd
                 have to be as dumb as they are.  I
                 know you're not dumb, so why would I
                 think that?  Why would you think I
                 might think that?

     She comes over and sits down on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 You're not dumb.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know about that.  You can't do
                 three falls and think you have much of
                 a brain.

     They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him.  He senses
     this, looks at her...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You getting serious on me now?

                              KAREN
                 I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know
                 what's gonna happen.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 You know.

     And he kisses her.

     EXT. DETROIT - DAY

     The sun is out.  The snow has stopped falling.  A white blanket
     covers everything.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

     Karen opens her eyes, wakes up.  She closes them again, lies
     on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.  Then...

                              KAREN
                 Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.

     She opens her eyes and rolls on to her back.  She turns her head:
     Foley's gone.  She gets out of bed.

     INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Karen comes into the room tying her robe.  She looks at the
     coffee table where...

     Something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and
     the ice bucket.  She picks it up and slowly unfolds the "gift"
     from Foley:  Her Sig-Sauer .38.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his
     underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room-
     service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by.

                              BUDDY
                 It took you, what, seven hours to buy
                 a pair of shoes?

                              FOLEY
                 I saw Karen Sisco.

     Buddy turns to him.

                              BUDDY
                 And she saw you?

                              FOLEY
                 Yes, she did.

                              BUDDY
                 So how's that work, a wanted felon
                 socializing with a U.S. Marshal?

                              FOLEY
                 You know how I felt about her.

                              BUDDY
                 Did you give her a jump?  If you did I
                 might begin to understand where your
                 head's at.

                              FOLEY
                 It wasn't about getting laid.  I just
                 wanted to know what might've happened
                 if things were different.

                              BUDDY
                 You find out?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I did.

     Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee.

                              BUDDY
                 So what's that mean?  That you're
                 disappointed by what you found or you're
                 sorry you robbed all those banks?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of
     glasses.  She reaches for the phone, dials.  A moment later, we
     hear MARSHALL SISCO'S ANSWERING MACHINE and she hangs up.

     INT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT

     A ring set up on stage.  Men hang out on the side.  Where movie
     seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of
     them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through
     the theatre to the bar.  Rap music booms out of speakers as
     fighters are announced.

     Everyone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob
     who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude
     black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along
     the apron of the stage.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, stick and jab!

     White Boy Bob throws down a beer and gives Glenn's shoulder a jab.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You drink like a girl.

     White Boy looks around to see if there are any other morons
     sitting nearby who think it's funny.  Kenneth comes through for
     his pal and laughs.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     As Karen walks through the bar, pauses as she sees Glenn sitting
     with White Boy and Kenneth.  She steps back into the shadows as
     Glenn glances anxiously about.

     ON GLENN

     As he pushes his chair back.

                              GLENN
                 I got to go take a piss.

     He hesitates, sees the car keys on the table in front of White
     Boy Bob.  But before he can grab them...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 What're you telling us for?  You want
                 somebody to hold your little pecker?

     Glenn gets up, sees his coat on the back of the chair, but knows
     he can't take it with him.  He walks away from the table.

     EXT. STATE THEATER - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

     Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot.
     Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME TIME

     Glenn behind the wheel, half lying on his right side as he tries
     to rip open the locked glove compartment.  His head jerks around
     as Karen opens the door.  He sits up straight as she gets in
     with him.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, are you trying to steal this
                 car?

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, I don't believe it.

                              KAREN
                 Another one of those days, huh, nothing
                 seems to go right?

     He raises his empty hands.

                              GLEN
                 I don't have the keys.

                              KAREN
                 I see that.

                              GLENN
                 I mean I'm not stealing the fucking
                 car.

                              KAREN
                 You're not?

                              GLENN
                 I already stole it.  Last week or
                 whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't
                 be stealing it again, can I?

                              KAREN
                 The two guys you were with -- that
                 one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it?
                 I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that
                 didn't look like him.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?

     Karen looks at him, shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, I know your life history, who
                 your friends are, where you've been
                 and now, it looks like, where you're
                 going.  Put your hands on the wheel.

                              GLENN
                 You're gonna bust me for picking up a
                 car?

                              KAREN
                 For the car, for aiding and abetting a
                 prison escape, and conspiring to do
                 whatever you came here for.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, these guys, they're gonna be
                 out here any minute looking for me.
                 They're fucking animals.

                              KAREN
                 What's going on, Glenn?

                              GLENN
                 Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck
                 outta here.

                              KAREN
                 But I thought the whole thing was your
                 idea?

                              GLENN
                 Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but
                 these guys, man, they're into shit I
                 can't handle.

                              KAREN
                 Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?

                              GLENN
                 Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at
                 his office tomorrow, take him out to
                 his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I
                 don't give a shit what they do.

                              KAREN
                 And is Foley a part of this?

                              GLENN
                 He's supposed to be, but he hasn't
                 shown up yet, which is a good thing
                 for him.

                              KAREN
                 Why's that?

                              GLENN
                 Maurice is gonna kill him, try and
                 collect the reward.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 But you say he hasn't shown up, you
                 think he backed out?

                              GLENN
                 I don't know-- he doesn't exactly
                 confide in me.

                              KAREN
                 Gee, I wonder why not.

                              GLENN
                 I'm freezing my ass off.

                              KAREN
                 You want to get out of here, run, it'll
                 warm you up.

                              GLENN
                 Really?

                              KAREN
                 But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to
                 me...

                              GLENN
                 I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I
                 believe it.  I keep thinking if you
                 hadn't driven me to federal court last
                 summer, you wouldn't even know who I
                 am.

                              KAREN
                 If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow
                 you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it
                 that way.  Go on.

     And he takes off.  She sits there another moment, then flicks
     her cigarette out the door, gets out the car.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

     Karen looks across the street at the theatre, sees people
     leaving.  A few seconds later, she steps behind a car and watches
     as Buddy and Foley pull into the lot.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     Maurice sits with White Boy and Kenneth as Foley and Buddy come
     down the aisle to their table.

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been?  You miss the big boys,
                 come in time for the walkout fights.
                 Well, shit, you may as well pull up a
                 chair.

     Foley and Buddy remain standing.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and
                 this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers.

     Foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY
                 Who's sitting here?

                              MAURICE
                 Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he
                 went to the men's about a while ago
                 and never came back.

     Foley gives Buddy a look.  White Boy Bob grins at them.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I think he must've fell in.

                              MAURICE
                 I sent these two looking for him, they
                 come back shaking their heads.

                              FOLEY
                 Well, if he left his coat and he's
                 been gone a while.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 The car's still there.  I looked.

                              MAURICE
                      (to the ring)
                 Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push
                 him off.

                              FOLEY
                 We're leaving.

                              MAURICE
                 The fuck you talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn
                 is...

     Maurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, what you worried about Glenn
                 for?  What's he know?

                              FOLEY
                 I thought everything.

     Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while
     the other one takes wild swings and misses...

                              MAURICE
                 Glenn knows everything we suppose to
                 do tomorrow.  Glenn could tell somebody
                 that, yeah, but it don't mean shit.
                 You understand?  'Cause Glenn don't
                 know I changed the plan.
                      (then)
                 It's happening tonight.

     Foley looks at Maurice now.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and
                 pick up what we need and go do it.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 You got two minutes, that's all.  Make
                 up your mind.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't asking permission.

     Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 They want to go tonight, before Glenn
                 gets in any trouble, opens his big
                 mouth.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you wanna do?

     Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You know they gonna set us up.

                              FOLEY
                 I get that feeling, yeah.

                              BUDDY
                 But you still think you can get the
                 diamonds fore they do?

     Foley looks at him a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here.
                 Right now.  I'll do the job with the
                 Snoop, meet you wherever you want and
                 give you half.

                              BUDDY
                 Half for doing what?

                              FOLEY
                 Getting me out of Glades for starters.

                              BUDDY
                 And who watches your back?

     ON MAURICE

     As he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy
     and Foley talk up at the bar.

                              MAURICE
                 Man has all that reward on his head
                 and still talks like a con in the yard.
                 You know what I'm saying?  Like he's a
                 man you don't mess with.  Yeah, well,
                 what I say to Jack Foley is buuullshit.

     EXT. MAURICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     It's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and
     Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing
     and heating company on the side.

     We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're watching from inside Karen's
     car.  She waits for the van to pull away, then follows.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Kenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel.  Buddy and Foley
     piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and
     equipment.  Maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls.

                              FOLEY
                 That what they're wearing these days
                 to break and enter?

                              MAURICE
                 Break and enter, shit.  Take it and
                 git, how it's done.  Don't waste any
                 time.  That's how you do it.

                              FOLEY
                 So you've done this before, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted
                 for it.
                      (then)
                 White Boy, tell these boys the reason
                 you went down on that burglary that
                 time.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I left my wallet in the house I robbed.

     The guy grins at them.  Foley can't believe it.

                              MAURICE
                 Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit
                 and leaves his wallet on the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm
                 very excited about tonight.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey.  You learn from doing.

     Foley and Buddy exchange looks.  Maurice turns around, a Beretta
     in his hand.  Foley looks at him.  Buddy tenses.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You know how to use one a these?

                              FOLEY
                 I've seen 'em used on TV.

     Maurice hands Foley the Beretta.  Then reaches into a bag, comes
     up with a .38 he hands to Buddy.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     As Karen tries to keep up with the van.  But with the snow and
     the way Kenneth drives, she starts to lose them.  She speeds up
     around a corner and loses control of the car.

     EXT. STREET - SAME

     As Karen's car does a 360 in the ice and snow.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Buddy and Foley are jostled about the back from Kenneth's insane
     driving.

                              BUDDY
                 Slow down.

     Kenneth grins in the mirror, punches it more.  Buddy gets out
     the .38 and touches it to the back of Kenneth's head.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Get ready to grab the wheel when I
                 shoot this asshole.

     Kenneth, his eyes freaked with speed, glares at Buddy in the
     mirror.

                              MAURICE
                 Do like he says, man.  Slow down.

     EXT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     As a pissed-off Karen gets out of her car, watches the van
     disappear.

                              KAREN
                 Shit --

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     She takes out her cellphone, punches a number, re-orients her
     car at the same time.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As the van creeps by one way, then the other, then pulls into
     the driveway.

     INT./EXT.  VAN - RIPLEY'S HOUSE

     All five of them in the back end of the van now, bumping into
     each other until Maurice lets White Boy out the rear end, leaving
     the doors open enough so he can watch.  He then racks the slide
     on a .45.

                              MAURICE
                 "An army .45 will stop all jive."
                 Huey P. said that.

                              BUDDY
                 You think he was talking about walking
                 into people's houses when he said it?

     Maurice looks at Buddy.  Buddy holds his gaze.  Then the coach
     lights on either side of the front entrance come on.

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls his mask down)
                 Get ready to go skiing.

     Now the front door opens...

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Here we go.

     We catch a glimpse of a WOMAN in the doorway, arms folded over
     her bathrobe as White Boy gives her a push and steps inside the
     house with her.

     Maurice is out of the truck and Kenneth, with a shotgun, is
     scrambling to be next.  Buddy catches him by his jacket collar
     and holds him squirming until Foley is out.

     The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge
     on Buddy, still in the truck.  Foley takes the barrel in one
     hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face.

                              FOLEY
                 Go on in the house before you get hurt.

     Kenneth puts his face up close to Foley's and stares at him
     good before going inside.  Foley turns to Buddy...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 There's still time, take me up on my
                 offer.

                              BUDDY
                 I'm not leaving you alone with these
                 assholes.

     INT. HOUSE - FOYER - SAME

     Where Maurice has the woman backed against a table.  She's in
     her forties, with thick red hair hanging free.  She looks ready
     to take a swing at whoever approaches...

                              WOMAN
                 I work here.  I'm the maid.

     Kenneth reaches out, opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy
     bra and low-cut panties before she slaps him away.

                              WOMAN/MAID
                 Fuck off.

                              KENNETH
                 Hey, shit, we're gonna have a party.

                              MAURICE
                 Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?

                              MAID
                 I told you, he isn't here.

                              MAURICE
                 Out for the evening?

                              MAID
                 He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 When's he due back?

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what difference does it
                 make?  You want to wait for him?

                              MAID
                 Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
                 Christmas to Easter.

                              MAURICE
                 You here all by yourself?

                              MAID
                      (beat)
                 That's right, just me.

     Foley catches the hesitation, glances at Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his
                 valuables in.

                              MAID
                 I don't have any idea.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go upstairs, have a look at the
                 man's bedroom.  All right now, you and
                 Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here.
                 Look at the wall behind any pictures
                 hanging on it.  Look at the walls in
                 the closets.  The man has a safe, it's
                 gonna be up there somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                 How about his place in Florida?  If
                 you'd called, we could've checked his
                 walls down there before we left.  That
                 is, if you'd checked to see where he
                 was.  You follow me?

     Maurice gives him a look, pulls the maid up the stairs.  Kenneth
     and White Boy Bob follow...

                              MAURICE
                 You set off any kind of alarm and you're
                 a dead Hazel.  Understand?

     Kenneth puts his arm around the maid.

                              KENNETH
                 What's you name, mama?

     He hooks a finger in the waist of her panties, pulls on the
     elastic, is about to look in there when Maurice backhands him
     across the face.

                              MAURICE
                 First money, then pussy.

     Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head.

                              FOLEY
                 You ever wear one of these?

                              BUDDY
                 I don't ski.

                              FOLEY
                 Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a
                 look around.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Karen on the phone... snow falling all around her.

                              RAYMOND CRUZ (PHONE)
                 I'll send a unit over there, see if
                 there's anything going on.

                              KAREN
                 Tell me where Ripley's house is.  I'll
                 meet them there.

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 Karen, you gonna promise me you're not
                 gonna go in, do anything stupid till I
                 get there...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

     Full of fat, cushy chairs and a sofa, everything white or black,
     a wet bar, a big TV, CD player.  Buddy moves into the doorway,
     peers inside.

     Kenneth is trying to find a radio station while Maurice and
     White Boy Bob ransack the place.  White Boy Bob checks under
     the mattress...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hey--

     Maurice and Kenneth look over expectantly.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 I found a rubber.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no
                 diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.

     Maurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Where's Foley?

                              BUDDY
                 Checkin' the other rooms, like you
                 said.

                              MAURICE
                      (to White Boy)
                 Go keep an eye on him.

     White Boy Bob slips out of the room.  Maurice turns to Kenneth,
     who's still playing with the stereo.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD.

                              KENNETH
                      (looking them over)
                 I don't recognize none of these bands.

                              MAURICE
                 Just pick one, put it on.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob watches from the end of the hall as Foley peers
     into each of the bedrooms.  Foley sees a back staircase and
     starts down.  A moment later White Boy Bob follows.

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes down the stairs.  No sign of Foley.  White
     Boy starts down one hallway, then turns back.  Now he's lost.
     He opens a door, starts to walk into a closet, then backs out.
     He goes down the hall, turns into...

     THE KITCHEN - SAME

     Where White Boy Bob enters, calls out tentatively.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Uh, Foley?

     He takes in the huge room, the massive sub-zero refrigerator.
     He moves to the freezer, opens it, takes in the FROZEN STEAKS.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Cool.

     INT. HALLWAY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME 

     As Foley quietly moves to the doorway, peers into the kitchen,
     watches White Boy Bob starts going through the freezer, taking
     out steaks and stacking them up on the counter.  Foley shakes
     his head and moves on.

     INT. LIBRARY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME

     Dark.  As Foley steps into the doorway, we BOOM DOWN to reveal
     a LIGHTED AQUARIUM in f.g.  He comes into the room, sits down
     in an armchair beside the fish tank.

     He leans close to the glass, stares at the fish a moment.  He
     sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room,
     sees how the phone cord disappears underneath.

                              FOLEY
                 They cut the lines, Richard.

     Silence.  The door opens and we see a terrified Richard Ripley
     sitting on top of a toilet, the phone in his lap.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley?  That you?

                              FOLEY
                 How are you, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what the hell are you
                 doing here?  What's going on?  Who's
                 upstairs?

                              FOLEY
                 Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

                              RIPLEY
                 Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.

     Ripley moves to the doorway.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Have they got Midge up there?

                              FOLEY
                 What kinda man lets a woman answer the
                 door, this time a night?

                              RIPLEY
                 We thought it might be her husband.
                 Sometimes he comes and checks up on
                 her.  She told him I was down in
                 Florida.

                              FOLEY
                 A minute or two, you're gonna wish you
                 were.

     Ripley looks at him.  Foley pats the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you come on over here, sit
                 down, Richard, have a look at your
                 fish.

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - ROAD - SAME

     As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     The music ON LOUD (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi).  Buddy stands
     in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he
     takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look
     them over.  He tries on a coat, turns to the maid.

                              MAURICE
                 How do I look, mama?

                              MAID
                 Like a fag.

     Maurice smiles at her, goes back into the closet.  Kenneth stares
     at the maid, nodding slowly.

                              KENNETH
                 I think she like to tussle with me.
                 Get boned a way she gonna remember.

     She looks to the doorway, where Buddy now starts to take a step
     into the room, when Maurice comes out of the closet...

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Motherfucker!

     He sticks his head out of the closet.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I found the safe.

     Buddy backs out of the room.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen drives slowly past the house.  White Boy Bob emerges
     with an armload of steaks and sets them on the front steps.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy!  Get your ass up here!

     White Boy Bob hurries back into the house.

     INT. RIPLEY'S LIBRARY - SAME

     Ripley sits on the couch across from Foley.  He keeps looking
     up at the ceiling.

                              RIPLEY
                 What do you want from me, Jack?  Name
                 it.  You want money?

                              FOLEY
                 You gonna write me a check?

                              RIPLEY
                 We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a
                 withdrawal.

     Foley just looks at him.  Buddy sticks his head in the room.

                              BUDDY
                 They found the safe.

                              FOLEY
                 You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, hi.  Nice house.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thank you.

     INT. BEDROOM - CLOSET DOORWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes in as Kenneth and Maurice are getting ready
     to blast the safe with the shotgun and pistol.

                              MAURICE
                 We gonna open up this fucker...

     Maurice and his boys open fire on the safe.  The maid covers up
     as bullets begin ricocheting all over the room.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Jesus...!

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     Karen sees the muzzle flashes in the upstairs window and quickly
     gets out of the car.

     INT. STUDY - SAME

     As Buddy and Ripley look up.

                              RIPLEY
                      (gets up)
                 Good God... they're shooting Midge!

                              FOLEY
                      (pushes him down)
                 Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open
                 the safe, not your maid.

     INT. BEDROOM

     As Maurice, Kenneth and White Boy Bob get ready to fire again.

                              MAURICE
                 A'ight, this time we gotta get the
                 motherfuckin' trajectory right...
                      (pause)
                 Okay, on three:  One... Two...

                              MAID
                 The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

     They all turn to look at her, guns still pointing at the safe.

                              MAID (CONT'D)
                 Richard's birthday.

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen cautiously makes her way towards the front door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     As Maurice finally gets the safe open.  They all anxiously peer
     inside.  Maurice narrows his eyes, reaches in, pulls out one of
     three toupees.  He stares at it.

                              MAURICE
                 ...the fuck is this...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Are they dead?

     He looks at White Boy Bob...

                              MAURICE
                 Go find Foley.  NOW!

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Foley leans forward in the chair now...

                              RIPLEY
                 I can't believe you're still angry
                 with me, Jack, after all this time.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm not angry, Richard.
                      (staring at the tank)
                 In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing
                 is, I can't tell if it's the fish
                 that're cooling me out or all those
                 uncut diamonds on the bottom of the
                 tank there.

     Ripley sags, closes his eyes.

                              BUDDY
                 Damn--

     And now Buddy takes a closer look and now we, too, see that
     strewn about the bottom of the aquarium are dozens of uncut
     diamonds of various sizes.

                              FOLEY
                 Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about
                 five million worth in there, wouldn't
                 you say, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Five point two.

                              BUDDY
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              FOLEY
                 They sure do.

     He gets up, looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Go get a bag.

     Foley turns to Richard as Buddy comes back into the room with a
     plastic bag, starts reaching into the tank.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I were you, I'd get up and run.

                              RIPLEY
                 I'm not leaving Midge.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're
                 gonna kill you.

                              RIPLEY
                 If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I love her, Jack.

     Foley looks at Buddy.  Now what?

                              BUDDY
                 C'mon.

     Foley just looks at Ripley, who doesn't move.

                              FOLEY
                 Good luck, Richard.

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Someone down here?

     Buddy and Foley slip out the other door, down the hall, just as
     Maurice walks in, some of Ripley's clothes over his arm.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.

                              RIPLEY
                 Are those my suits?

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been hiding, Dick?

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     A now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley
     and Buddy emerge from the house.

     AT THE VAN

     As Buddy leans under the dash.  Foley looks up at the house
     where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear
     the faint pumping of the music.  We hear the VAN START.

                              BUDDY
                 Okay.

     Buddy straightens up, looks at Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Come on.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

                              BUDDY
                 What?

                              FOLEY
                 They're gonna rape the maid, aren't
                 they.

                              BUDDY
                 From the looks of those boys, the
                 Ripper too.

                              FOLEY
                 And then they'll kill 'em.

                              BUDDY
                 At least.

     Foley looks at the diamonds in the bag.

                              FOLEY
                 We made it, didn't we?

                              BUDDY
                 All you gotta do is get in.

     Again Foley looks at the diamonds, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm going back inside.

                              BUDDY
                 I'll go with you.

     Foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it...

                              FOLEY
                 No, you dump the van, meet me at the
                 airport.
                 I'll take one of Ripley's cars.

                              BUDDY
                 Jack --

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about
                 to go down, you'll be on the phone
                 with your sister for a month.  Let me
                 do this part alone.

     Buddy just looks at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I'm saying this isn't your problem.
                 Far as I'm concerned, we're square.

     Foley turns to go.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey...

     Buddy hands him his gun.  Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back
     of his pants, and then turns back to the house.

                              FOLEY
                 Now get outta here.

     KAREN
     
     As she watches Foley go back inside.  A moment later, the van
     pulls out of the driveway.  Karen makes a decision, starts for
     the side of the house...

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE - THE FOYER - SAME

     Foley enters and we hear the maid scream.  Foley starts up
     the stairs.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY

     Maurice and White Boy Bob both have their guns to Ripley's head.

                              RIPLEY
                      (hears the scream)
                 Midge.

                              MAURICE
                 Forget about her.  Tell me where the
                 money's at.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley's got it.

                              MAURICE
                 Where the fuck is Foley?

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME

     Foley comes up the stairs, heads for Ripley's bedroom.  The
     door is closed now...

                              FOLEY
                 Midge?

     He steps to one side, is about to reach for the knob when
     suddenly the DOOR IS BLASTED OFF ITS HINGES.

     INT. KITCHEN (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME TIME

     Karen comes through the door, hears the gunshot, stops cold.

     INT. HALLWAY (UPSTAIRS) - SAME

     As Foley steps into the doorway and we see Kenneth and the maid
     bare, both sitting up in bed, Kenneth racking the shotgun, the
     maid turning away from him, gathering the covers that hang off
     her side of the bed...

     ...and coming around to throw them like a net at Kenneth as the
     shotgun goes off and the covers catch fire as Foley pumps one
     two three shots into Kenneth somewhere under there.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Ripley tries to get away...

                              RIPLEY
                 Midge!

     Maurice grabs him by the collar, spins him around and whips him
     across the face with his gun.  He and White Boy Bob then both
     hit Ripley on the head until he goes down and stays down.

                              MAURICE
                      (to WBB)
                 You take the front stairs, I'll take
                 the back.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As the maid jumps up and drags the burning covers from the bed
     and sees Kenneth now, the bullet holes in his chest, staring
     blankly back at him.  She then looks at Foley.

                              MAID
                      (cold)
                 Where's Dick?

                              FOLEY
                 Downstairs.
                      (then)
                 But wait here.  There's two more.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley starts out of the room and immediately hears...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hold it, asshole!

     Foley sees White Boy Bob at the bottom of the stairs.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Drop the gun.

     Nowhere to go, Foley has to comply.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Now stay right there.  Don't move.

     White Boy Bob starts to jog up the stairs two at a time, all
     the while keeping his eyes fixed on Foley.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Maurice!  I got Foley!

     INT. RIPLEY'S BACK STAIRCASE - SAME

     As Maurice starts up the backstairs...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Maurice!  Up here!

     ...and a moment later, Karen comes out of the kitchen into the
     downstairs hallway -- just missing each other.

     INT. STAIRCASE - SAME

     As White Boy Bob gets maybe half way up when he catches a toe
     on one of the risers and pitches forward.  Stupidly, he tries
     to break his fall with the elbow of his gun hand and ends up
     jamming his chin down onto the muzzle of his gun which,
     unfortunately for him, goes off, firing a bullet through his
     head and killing him instantly.

     To say the least, Foley is stunned by this freak accident.  He
     stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 You learn from doing.

     Foley bends down to pick up his gun and we see MAURICE COMING
     UP THE BACK STAIRCASE, his gun raised, and now firing away...

     Foley is forced to jump back behind a pillar as Maurice keeps
     firing at him, shots ricocheting off the pillar, the railing,
     the wall...

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Karen hugs the wall at the sound of gunshots, sees Ripley
     lying on the floor of the study...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As we hear CLICK as the breech opens on Maurice's now empty .45
     And now Foley steps out from behind the pillar and calmly bends
     down, picks up his gun, Maurice still walking forward...

                              MAURICE
                 Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?

                              FOLEY
                 Not until recently.

                              MAURICE
                      (still coming)
                 Nervous?

                              FOLEY
                 A little.

                              MAURICE
                      (getting close)
                 This kind of setup, you don't have any
                 idea what the fuck you're doing -- do
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 You're right.  So why take a chance--

     Foley pulls the trigger.  CLICK.  Maurice hesitates, surprised
     that Foley would pull the trigger, then the two of them at the
     same time rush each other, begin a messy mano a mano, now using
     their spent guns as bludgeons.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Karen carefully comes into the room, Ripley lets out a low
     GROAN.  She's bending down to check him when HER PHONE RINGS.

     As Foley and Maurice grapple on the floor near the head of the
     stairs.

     As Karen answers her phone, checks Ripley...

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 We're a few minutes away.  Just sit
                 tight, stay outta the house till we
                 get there, understand?

                              KAREN
                 Oh-kay...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.  Maurice rolls
     down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as...
     
     Foley gets up, runs back to the bedroom.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins
     searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over
     the body, etc) with no success...

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk
     of White Boy Bob.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley, exasperated, stands back up...

                              MIDGE (O.S.)
                 This what you want?

     Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe,
     but more importantly, clutching the shotgun.  Foley crosses and
     takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when --

                              MIDGE (CONT'D)
                 It's empty.

     Foley just looks at her.

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with
     a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs...

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Maurice--

     Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing
     in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him...

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS,
     then a BODY FALL.

     He stands still.  Not sure who was just shot.  After a long moment,
     we then hear:

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the
     wall.

                              KAREN (OS) (CONT'D)
                 I know you're up there.

     INT. FOYER - SAME

     As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down
     over his face.  He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his
     pistol in another.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Jack -- don't.

                              FOLEY
                 Pretend I'm somebody else.

                              KAREN
                 You think I'd shoot you?

     Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun.  AND NOW WE HEAR
     THE SIRENS...

                              FOLEY
                 If you don't, one of those guys will.

                              KAREN
                 What're you now, a desperado?  Put the
                 guns down.

                              FOLEY
                 I told you, I'm not going back.

     He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen,
     but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or
     look around.

                              KAREN
                 Don't do this.  Please.

     They stand there staring at each other.

                              FOLEY
                 No more time outs.

     He raises the guns.  She sadly shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns,
     grabbing hold of his right thigh.  And now Cruz and several
     other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop...

                              CRUZ
                 Karen, I told you not to--

                              KAREN
                 Wait, I know him --okay?

     She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently
     lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 You just did, for Christ sake.

                              KAREN
                 You know what I mean.

     She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer
     to him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wish things were different.  I'm
                 sorry, Jack.

     Foley looks like he's in pain.  He watches as she walks back
     down the stairs.  As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and
     pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer.

                              MIDGE
                 Richard!

     She comes running down the stairs into his arms.  They embrace.
     He looks at Foley over her shoulder...

                              RIPLEY
                      (sympathetic)
                 Listen, Jack...
                      (but then)
                 What'd you do with my diamonds?

     Foley just looks at him.

     EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT

     As Buddy pulls the van into an alley.  He jumps out, jogs back
     to the street and hails a cab...

     INT. CAB - SAME

     Buddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass.

                              BUDDY
                 The airport.

     The cab pulls away.  Buddy glances up front, then pulls the
     Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up.  There's a bit of
     water in along with the diamonds.  A tiny fish swims in the
     water.  Something about this makes Buddy smile as we...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. KAREN'S HOTEL - MORNING

     The sun is out.  The sky is clear.

                              KAREN (VO)
                 They don't know yet if they want to
                 bring him up on the homicides.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

     Karen on the phone.  Her suitcase on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 I doubt if they will.  The Bureau's
                 put a detainer on him, so when they're
                 through with him here he'll go back to
                 Florida.

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Marshall on the phone...

                              MARSHALL
                 You gonna go get him?

                              KAREN
                 It's possible.  Why?

                              MARSHALL
                 I was just thinking... you could have
                 a nice time with him on the plane --
                 like picking up where your interlude,
                 or whatever you call it, left off.
                 And then throw him in the can.

                              KAREN
                 He knew what he was doing.  Nobody
                 forced him to rob banks.

                              MARSHALL
                 My little girl, the tough babe.

     Karen hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window.

     INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

     Where Foley stands staring out of his window.

                              VOICE
                 Foley.

     As Foley turns around and faces a FEDERAL MARSHAL in the doorway,
     we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled.

     INT/EXT. PRISON STATION GARAGE - DAY

     The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black
     government van waits.  The Marshal helps Foley inside.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Have a nice trip.
                      (looks OS)
                 I'll get the other one.

     INT/EXT. VAN - SAME

     As Foley sits down, stares at the floor.  He looks depressed.
     We hear the front door open, then close.

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that
     separates the front from the back.

                              KAREN
                 I got you a present, something for the
                 road.

     She pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I have to take it away, though, soon
                 as the ride's over.

     Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once
     more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with
     a shaved head -- into the back of the van.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.

     An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the
     door then gets in up front with Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 Hejira?  What kinda name is that?

                              HEJIRA
                 Islamic.

                              FOLEY
                 What's it mean, "No Hair"?

                              HEJIRA
                 The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed
                 from Mecca in 622.

                              FOLEY
                 The flight?

                              HEJIRA
                 The brothers in Leavenworth gave me
                 the name.

                              FOLEY
                 You were at Leavenworth, huh?

                              HEJIRA
                 For a time.

                              FOLEY
                 Meaning?

                              HEJIRA
                 Meaning time came, I left.

                              FOLEY
                 You busted out?

                              HEJIRA
                 I prefer to call it an exodus from an
                 undesirable place.

                              FOLEY
                      (interested now)
                 And how long was it before they caught
                 up with you?

                              HEJIRA
                 That time?

                              FOLEY
                 There were others.

                              HEJIRA
                 Yeah.  That was the ninth.

                              FOLEY
                      (really interested)
                 The ninth?

                              HEJIRA
                 Ten, you count the prison hospital in
                 Ohio I walked away from.

                              FOLEY
                 You must be some kinda walker, Henry.

                              HEJIRA
                 Hejira.

                              FOLEY
                 And so now you're off to Glades.

                              HEJIRA
                 Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to
                 leave last night with the lady marshal,
                 but for some reason she wanted to wait.

                              FOLEY
                      (looks at Karen)
                 She did, huh.

                              HEJIRA
                 Cheaper I guess, take us both down in
                 one van.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought
                 we'd have a lot to talk about.

                              HEJIRA
                 Like what?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.
                      (then)
                 It's a long way down to Florida.

     Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and
     considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little
     higher than when he first sat down, as we then...

                         PEARL HARBOR


                              by

                        Randall Wallace























                          EARLY DRAFT








	Out of BLACK we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by.

	EXT.  POV OF AN AIRPLANE

	Flying over American heartland.  We see the earth through the
	pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the
	plane swooping down and storming over the ground.

	THE PLANE

	is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants.  It
	releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again...

	Up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like
	honey over family farms stretching to the horizon.  Maybe
	it's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee.  But as long as
	there's been an America, men have fought and died for this
	place -- as volunteers.

	Far off, but visible from the plane is

	A BARN - DAY

	The barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says
	"McCawley Crop Dusting." Another plane noise, this one made
	by kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an
	old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats,
	and wheels.

	The boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg
	they've replaced the seat with.  They've even attached a 2x4
	as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help.  They
	wear overalls and have bowl haircuts:  RAFE and DANNY, 10
	years old.

					RAFE
			Bandits at 2 o'clock.

					DANNY
			Power dive!

	They buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls,
	Rafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other.

					RAFE
			It's Germans!

					DANNY
			Kill the bastards!

	Rafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go
	right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine
	gun and engine sounds.

					RAFE
			Good shooting, Danny!

					DANNY
			Good shooting, Rafe!

					RAFE
			Land of the free...

					DANNY
			Home of the brave!

					RAFE
			There's another one!

	Their vocal motors roar again... But a man's hand grabs Danny
	by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit.

	It's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his
	hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still
	left -- are rotting.  He's also missing an arm; but the one
	that's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it.

					DANNY'S FATHER
			You no count boy!  Johnson come lookin',
			said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel
			his pig shed, and I can't find you no
			place.

					DANNY
			Daddy, I told you I was comin' here.

	His father slaps him off his feet.  Rafe is so horrified he
	can't get a sound out.  Danny isn't even surprised.  But when
	his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps
	so tight they choke him, he struggles.  It does no good; his
	father starts marching across the field, dragging and
	strangling Danny.

					DANNY
			Da!... Dad...

	The father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until
	CRACK!  The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking
	him to the ground and making him drop Danny.

	The father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the
	2x4 like a bat.

					RAFE
			Let him alone!

	The father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet.

					DANNY
			Rafe... Daddy... No!

	The man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board.

					RAFE
			I'll bust you open, you...German!

	The words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken
	brain.  He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom
	of blood to his mouth.  He wipes it with his hand, but blood
	clings to his teeth.  He chokes out --

					DANNY'S FATHER
			I fought the Germans.

	He looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's
	just done.  He turns and staggers away.

	Danny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by
	something deeper than blood.  Then Danny runs off after his
	father.

					DANNY
			Daddy!  Daddy!  Wait.

	Danny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away
	with him.

	The crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind
	Rafe.  The pilot, RAFE'S FATHER, shuts off the engine.

					RAFE'S FATHER
			What's goin' on, son?

					RAFE
			Nothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get
			him.

	Rafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4
	propeller.  His father looks toward Danny and his father,
	walking away, then looks at his own son.

					RAFE'S FATHER
			Hey, boy -- you wanna go up?

	Rafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his
	father's lap.  As his father cranks the engine and tucks him
	into the harness, Rafe says --

					RAFE
			Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up
			too?

					RAFE'S FATHER
			Sure will, son.

	The engine races to life...and we --

	American P-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming
	and wind singing by their wings.

	There are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we
	focus on two:  RAFE MCCAWLEY has grown lean and handsome.
	And DANNY WALKER is very much the same.

	Their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while
	the other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and
	Danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high,
	the other diving and coming back up in his place,
	leapfrogging.

	It scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and
	out, so close.  The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through
	binoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			McCawley!  Walker!  Cut that out!

					RAFE
			I thought this was a training flight.
			I'm just trying to give Danny some
			training.

					DANNY
			Not on your best day, boy!

	Rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction
	he was moving before.  Danny reacts almost instantly...
	leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out
	of everybody else.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			That's it, get into a wedge!

	The squadron responds, forming up into a tight V, Rafe and
	Danny just behind and on either side of the center.

					RAFE
			Didn't you say test the limits?

					DANNY
			Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better
			line up a couple dozen women on the
			GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the
			air!

	Rafe grins, loving the challenge.  Then he and Danny do the
	leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the V.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Everybody down!

	EXT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - DAY

	The planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut
	down their props, slide back the canopies and hop down.  We
	see young pilots we'll get to know:  ANTHONY, BILLY, RED.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Where are McCawley and Walker?

	EXT.  RAFE AND DANNY - STILL IN THE AIR - DAY

	They've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now
	heading right at each other, like two bullets playing
	chicken.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Aw shit...

	INT.  THE COCKPITS

	From Rafe and Danny's POV, the rush is awesome.

	THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND watch in awe as the P-40's get so
	close they can't possibly get out of each other's way.
	Billy, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown
	out the sound of the collision...

	At the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that
	their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other
	belly to belly.

	IN THE COCKPITS

	Rafe and Danny burst out laughing.

	THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND

	laugh and congratulate each other.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			You know what they say... You can take the
			crop duster out of the country -- but
			don't put him in a P-40.

	Rafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him.  Danny has
	Rafe's plane in his sights.

					DANNY
			If I had guns I'd be chewing up your --

	Rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny.

					RAFE
			If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.

	They're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny.  But
	as Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and
	snaps the nose of his plane straight up.

	THE OTHER PILOTS stop laughing.

					ANTHONY
			He's doing an inside loop!

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Aw, shit...

	Danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come
	in behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.

					DANNY
			Yee-hawww!!!

	Danny taxis his plane over to join the others.  He's grinning
	as he slides back his cockpit cover; then --

					DANNY
			Where's Rafe?

	Red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the
	air.  Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to
	refasten his harness.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			You're down, Walker!  That's an order!

					DANNY
			What about him?

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			He's not taking my orders anymore.

	Danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he
	notices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.

					DANNY
			He's gonna do it.

					BILLY
			Do what?

					DANNY
			It.
				(beat)
			Aw, shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

	RAFE'S PLANE reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above
	them, and seems to pause in the air.

					DANNY
			I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.
			I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

					BILLY
			Why?

					DANNY
			Cause now he's gonna do an outside loop.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Aw shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

	Anthony and Billy join in, like an involuntary chant --

					ANTHONY & BILLY
			Aw shit shit shit...

	RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT, is tightly controlled, yet serene.  He
	noses the plane into a power dive.

	The P-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going
	so fast it begins to shudder.

	THE OTHER PILOTS are transfixed.  Red is so nervous he can't
	get the words out.

					RED
			Aw sh- sh- sh- sh-

					BILLY
			Shit.

					RED
			Yeah.

					DANNY
			You can do it, Rafe.  You can do it.

	The P-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed,
	snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the
	runway.  Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the
	asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his
	head.

	He pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside
	of the circle.  The plane reaches the top of its arc, and
	almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the
	earth, only this time he has very little altitude.  The plane
	hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the
	curve...

	And makes it full circle.  Rafe's head now is barely a foot
	off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted.

	THE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers.

	RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile.

	He lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for
	the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head.

	Danny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his
	canopy.  Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.

					DANNY
			You could've killed yourself, you stupid
			bastard!

	He dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe.

					DANNY
			That was the most beautiful thing I ever
			saw.

	INT.  COLONEL DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - DAY

	COLONEL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, mid-forties, is commander of the
	base.  He's as tough as he is good in the air.  And right now
	he's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before
	him.

					DOOLITTLE
			There are some people who think the
			outside loop is reckless and
			irresponsible.

					RAFE
			How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if
			you were the first man in the world to do
			it?

					DOOLITTLE
			Don't get smart with me, son.

					RAFE
			Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous
			only for the kind of pilot who wants to
			show off, rather than inspire the other
			pilots in his unit.  And all you've done
			for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I
			did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir.
			What the French call a "homage."

					DOOLITTLE
			That's bullshit, son.  But it's really
			good bullshit.

					RAFE
			Thank you, Sir.

	Doolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's
	hand.

					DOOLITTLE
			Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire
			your decision.

					RAFE
			Thank you, Sir.

	INT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - BARRACKS - NIGHT

	The pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town.
	Danny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on
	cologne, and looks terrific in his uniform.

	Anthony and Billy are combing their hair at the sinks.  Billy
	declares to his image in the mirror --

					BILLY
			You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you
			EVER die!

					ANTHONY
			That's your line for tonight, ya know.

					BILLY
			What, good-lookin' sumbitch?

					ANTHONY
			No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse
			alone, you look her in the eye, and say,
			"Baby, they're training me for war, and I
			don't know what'll happen.  But if I die
			tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all
			we could tonight."  I've never known it
			to fail.

	Red finishes brushing his teeth at the sink beside them.

					RED
			He's n-never known it to work, either.

	The guys head out laughing, running into Rafe coming in.

					DANNY
			Doolittle didn't kill you?  Attaboy!

	Rafe catches Danny's arm.

					RAFE
			Danny, there's something I gotta tell
			you...

	EXT.  NEW JERSEY BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny are walking on the parade ground; the other
	guys are already on the bus that will take them into town.
	Danny's upset by what Rafe just told him.

					DANNY
			How could you do this?

					RAFE
			The Colonel helped me work it out.

					DANNY
			I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork,
			I mean how the hell did you do it without
			letting me in on it?

					RAFE
			I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only
			accepting the best pilots.

					DANNY
			Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're
			talking about war, and I know what war
			does to people.

					RAFE
			Danny, you know how many times I saw you
			come to school with a black eye or a
			busted nose, and couldn't do a thing
			about it -- for you, or for your mother...
			or your father, with his lungs scorched
			out with mustard gas, and more left of
			his lungs than there was of his spirit?
			You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's
			time I made mine.

					BILLY
				(from the bus)
			The nurses are waiting!

					RAFE
			Let's go.

					DANNY
			Nah, you go on.

					RAFE
			I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you
			to meet her.

					DANNY
			Some other time.  I don't feel like a
			party.

	Danny walks away.  The bus driver's ready to leave, and Red
	is honking the horn for Rafe to come.  Rafe reluctantly lets
	Danny go, and heads for the bus, where the pilots are
	chanting --

					PILOTS VOICE
			Nurses!  Nurses!  Nurses!

	INT.  A MOVING TRAIN - DAY

	The trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats,
	shaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy
	section.  But the glow of the train is outshone by EVELYN
	STEWART.  She's one of ten young women, Army nurses, gathered
	at one end of the car as it rattles along the track.

	The other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too
	ripe.  Their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered,
	their spirits high.

	Evelyn listens in amusement to BETTY, a cute blonde with
	unmissable boobs, and BARBARA, a burnette equally endowed.

					BETTY
			Do you have trouble with your boobs in
			the uniform?

					BARBARA
			You mean hiding them?

					BETTY
			Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm
			talking about how you make them show!

	SANDRA, another nurse, speaks up.

					SANDRA
			Loan 'em to me, I'll make 'em show.

					BETTY
			The boobs or the pilots?

	The girls laugh and shove each others' knees; it's a party
	wherever they go.  But Evelyn can't keep her mind on the
	frivolity.  She looks out the window and her thoughts drift
	away.

					BARBARA
			We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!

					BETTY
			Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come
			on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want
			to know what we can expect.

	Suddenly all the girlish faces are looking at Evelyn.

					EVELYN
			I've been dating one pilot.  And only for
			a few weeks.  But I know he's different
			from all the others.

	Sandra throws up her arms and swoons onto her friends.

					SANDRA
			True love!...

					BETTY
			Morphine, give her morphine!

					BARBARA
			Give her an enema.

					EVELYN
			But I do have a warning for you.  There's
			one line you all need to know, and you're
			likely to hear it from any man in a
			uniform.  It goes like this:  "Honey,
			Baby... We never know what's gonna happen,
			and I may die tomorrow...so, let's live
			all we can tonight."

	A silence among the nurses.

					BARBARA
			I tell you.  Any one of those arrogant,
			leather-jacketed, slick-lookin' flyboys
			tries that line on me...he's gonna get
			anything he wants.

	As the nurses laugh --

	EXT.  NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	Our pilots -- indeed leather-jacketed and handsome -- are
	waiting on the platform.  Among then is Rafe, holding
	something behind his back, as the train pulls in and shudders
	to a stop, clouds of steam jetting onto the platform and
	giving the moment a dream-like haze.

	INT./ EXT.  TRAIN - NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	The nurses start stepping out; both pilots and nurses pretend
	surprise to see each.  At the door of the train, Evelyn
	whispers to Betty --

					EVELYN
			Stick with me, I'll find you somebody
			good.

	Betty spot's Rafe.

					BETTY
			I'll take that one.

					EVELYN
			He's taken.  But come on, I'll introduce
			you.

	They move to Rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his
	eyes holding Evelyn.

					RAFE
			Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.

					EVELYN
			You too, Lieutenant.

	Betty clears her throat.

					EVELYN
			Oh, this is Betty.

					RAFE
			Nice to meet you, Betty.

	He draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two
	roses.  He hands one to Evelyn and the second to Betty.

					RAFE
			Danny would'a brought this.

	He escorts them along the platform.

					EVELYN
			Danny's not coming?

					RAFE
			No, he...got some news today.  He'll be
			okay, he just didn't feel like coming
			tonight.

					EVELYN
			I was hoping to meet him.

					BETTY
			I was hoping to meet him.

					RAFE
			We'll just have to find a substitute,
			won't we?

	Betty stops, and faces Rafe.

					BETTY
			I just want to tell you one thing.  If
			you're thinking this might be your last
			night on earth?... I'm prepared to make
			it meaningful.
				(leaning close)
			Very meaningful.

					EVELYN
			At ease, Betty!

	INT.  CITY NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

	It's a party in full swing; swing music, jitterbugging,
	beautiful young men and women in high spirits.

	Rafe and Evelyn are sitting at a big table with the other
	pilots and nurses.  Anthony's paired up with Sandra, Billy
	with Barbara, and Red, shyest of the group, finds himself
	next to Betty.  Betty's already found a companion in Red
	Strange.

					RED
			He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.

					BETTY
			Red...Strange?

					RED
			You know the football player, Red G-
			Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red,
			cause you know, I'm red...and they
			thought I was strange, so, you know, Red
			G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.

					BETTY
			But...they called you Strange?  Because
			of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red
			Grange strange?

					RED
			How would I know.

	Beside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and
	swigs from that.  Rafe and Evelyn see this, and try to keep
	from laughing.

					BETTY
			Do you always stutter?

					RED
			Only when I'm n-n-n-

					BETTY
			Nervous?

					RED
			Yeah.  But if I have to get something
			out, I c-can always s-s-s-
				(he sings)
			SIIING!

	She covers his hand with hers.

					BETTY
			Don't be nervous.

	Red looks at Betty with love in his eyes.  Under the table,
	Rafe and Evelyn join hands too.

					EVELYN
			There shipping us out.  Hawaii.  The
			Germans are overrunning Europe, and we're
			sent to paradise.  How about you?  Have
			you heard anything?

	He hesitates; then Evelyn is distracted by the conversation
	beside them, between Barbara and Billy.

					BILLY
			You're a very special woman, and...well
			baby, they're training me for war, and we
			don't know what happens tomorrow.  So we
			gotta make tonight special.

	Barbara shoots a look at Evelyn, before she answers.

					BARBARA
			I hope you can back that up, flyboy.
			Cause you're not ever gonna forget
			tonight.

	She takes him by the hand and pulls him to his feet... They
	start dancing, sexy movements that won't stop till they've
	been in bed.

	Rafe pulls Evelyn to her feet, and leads her through the
	dancers, outside.

	EXT.  THE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

	They find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the
	river, and Manhattan beyond.  Evelyn takes in the view,
	breathes in the air; she still holds the rose.

					EVELYN
			Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't
			good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard
			to say.

					RAFE
			The only reason it's hard to say is that
			I keep thinking I don't have the right to
			say it.  But I've got to because it's
			true.  I love you.
				(beat)
			That must surprise you.

					EVELYN
			It surprises me that I'm not the only one
			on this balcony who feels that way.

	The power of hearing this from each other grips them both.

					RAFE
			There's one thing I have to say.  I'm
			going away.

					EVELYN
			We're all going away.

					RAFE
			I'm going to the war.  The real war.
			Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are
			hanging on by their fingernails, and If
			they lose, there'll be more people killed
			than anybody can imagine.  And not just
			there, but here.

					EVELYN
			But you're in the U.S. Army, how could
			you --

					RAFE
			Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and
			put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need
			pilots, and we need experience.  I leave
			tomorrow.

					EVELYN
			You waited til tonight to tell me?

					RAFE
			I had to tell you in person.  Because
			there's something else I need to say.

	He studies her face, burning it into his memory.

					RAFE
			Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make
			tonight memorable.  What I feel about you
			makes it impossible for me to say
			something like that.  If I don't come
			back, I don't want to saddle you with
			regret and sadness you'll carry the rest
			of your life.

					EVELYN
			I don't know if you can choose that,
			Rafe.

					RAFE
			Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I
			love you.  And I will come back.  I'll
			find a way.  And then we'll get a chance
			to know if what I felt the first moment I
			saw you, and every minute since then, is
			real.

					EVELYN
			Do one thing for me, before you go.

	She takes his hand and leads him inside.

	INT.  NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

	She leads him onto the dance floor, and they dance, among the
	others, yet in a world apart from everyone else.  And then
	they stop while all the others move around them, and kiss the
	kind of kiss that lasts a lifetime.

	EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

	The nurses are entering the hotel.  Pilots are going in with
	them.  But Rafe and Evelyn stop on the street.

	A last kiss.  Their hands touch a final time, and then part.
	She moves inside the lobby, and looks out the glass doors as
	he walks away.

	EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN

	Rafe and Danny stand on the platform.  Rafe's got his gear
	packed in a bag slung over his shoulder.

					CONDUCTOR'S VOICE
			All aboard!

	Rafe glances once more toward the revolving doors from the
	station that lead onto the platform.

					DANNY
			Didn't you say you told her not to come?

					RAFE
			Yeah.

					DANNY
			Then why are you looking for her?

					RAFE
			It's a test.  If I asked her to come and
			she came, it wouldn't tell me anything.
			If I tell her not to come, and she
			comes...then I know she loves me.

					VOICE
			ALL ABOARD!

					DANNY
			You're still a kid, ya know that?  Take
			care of yourself.

					RAFE
			You too.

	Rafe sticks his hand out to Danny.  Danny knocks it away, and
	hugs him.

	Rafe steps onto the train, and it pulls away.  Rafe waves.
	Danny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer...

					DANNY
			Give 'em hell, Rafe.

	INT.  TRAIN - DAWN

	Rafe finds a seat and sits down.  He's the only one in the
	car, and he's deeply alone.

	EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN

	Danny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the
	station.  He takes the one on the far right.  As he passes
	through it, he doesn't see Evelyn rushing through the door on
	the left side.  She's told herself she wouldn't come, but
	couldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the
	train disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits
	her.

	She stands on the empty platform, as lonely as Rafe.

	MONTAGE - THE JOURNEYS

	Rafe and Evelyn travel in opposite directions, toward
	opposite ends of the earth...

	EXT.  A GRAY, COLD, CANADIAN SEAPORT - DAY

	as Rafe boards a Canadian naval vessel headed into the North
	Atlantic.

	EXT.  TRAIN - TRAVELING THROUGH THE AMERICAN WEST - DAY

	Evelyn and her fellow nurses ride the train through the
	American southwest.  The scenery outside the window is
	beautiful, but her thoughts are far away...

	EXT.  NORTH ATLANTIC - DAY

	Rafe's ship is in a convoy through the rough gray waters.
	The deck is loaded with military supplies bound for Britain.
	Rafe stands among the drab crates and seems oblivious to the
	rain, his thoughts on Evelyn.

	He looks toward the eastern horizon, where his ship is
	heading.  A deep, dark storm is brewing before them...

	EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

	Evelyn stands on the deck of a ship headed in the opposite
	direction, on another ocean, the sky is clear, the breeze is
	warm, the light of a glowing sunset bathes her face.  The
	MONTAGE ENDS, with them heading to different ends of the
	earth.

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DUSK

	In the eternal dusk of England, everything is cold and gray.
	British fighter planes -- Spitfires and Hurricanes -- are
	surrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled
	fuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines.
	Rafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag.
	He moves up behind a slim, pale BRITISH AIR COMMANDER who is
	surveying engine damage on one of the Spitfires.

					RAFE
			Rafe McCawley, Sir.

	Rafe salutes as the Air Commander turns and then returns the
	salute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone.  Rafe
	freezes at the sight, reminded of Danny's father.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?

					RAFE
			That's me, Sir.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll
			get you situated in some quarters, and
			then introduce you to the equipment
			you'll be flying.

					RAFE
			If you're patching up bullet holes right
			here on the runway, maybe we should skip
			the housekeeping and get right to the
			planes.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are
			to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?

					RAFE
			Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to
			matter.

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY

	A Spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a
	string of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a
	shot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood
	still splattered over the inside of the cockpit.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Good lad.  Didn't die till he'd landed
			and shut down his engine.  Welcome to the
			war.

	He walks away, leaving Rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - MILITARY BASE - DAY

	Evelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps.
	As they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially
	Evelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other --

					GUARD
			I've died and gone to heaven.

	The guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses.  The jeeps
	drive through.  The nurses are loving this island paradise
	already.

					BARBARA
			You know the ratio of men to women on
			this island?  Four-thousand...to one.

	Barbara slides on a new pair of sunglasses with plastic palm
	trees glued on the sides, and calls back to the guards as the
	jeeps pull away --

					BARBARA
			See ya on the beach, boys!

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE - NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - DAY

	As the other nurses happily unpack, Evelyn leaves and crosses
	the grass in the drenching sunshine.  We follow her into --

	INT.  BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	She finds a small, immaculately clean hospital, twenty beds
	with luminous white sheets, all empty.

	Then she notices the view.  It's of Pearl Harbor, with the
	entire American Pacific fleet riding at anchor.  Battleships
	all in a row.  Aircraft carriers too, in perfect stillness on
	the aqua blue water with a white sand bottom.  The view is
	expansive and beautiful.

	The sound of an approaching fighter plane with wing guns
	firing as we --

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  THE DARK SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

	Rafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his
	Spitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again
	into a squadron of Messerschmidts; they outnumber the British
	planes, and they're tougher and faster.  Rafe darts through
	their line, machine guns blazing.

	One of the Spitfires in Rafe's squadron has taken hits in the
	engine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its
	pilot, NIGEL, frantic as the German planes swarm into finish
	him.

					BRITISH PILOT (NIGEL)
			I need help!  Someone get them off me!

	Rafe slams his control stick hard right and goes into a power
	dive at one of the Messerschmidts.  Rafe's bullets chew up
	its cockpit and the plane goes into a fast corkscrew spiral,
	down into the water.

	Rafe instantly climbs again.  Nigel, in the moment of safety
	Rafe has bought him, bails out, his chute blossoming and
	carrying him toward the water.  The OTHER BRITISH PILOTS are
	impressed.

					OTHER BRITISH PILOT
				(into radio)
			Nigel's out!  I'll call in the position!
				(to himself)
			That Yank is bloody good.

	Rafe swings his plane right back at the Germans; he attacks
	them head on, just like he went at Danny, only this time he's
	firing his machine guns.

	And OVER THIS ferocious dogfight, we hear his letter to
	Evelyn...

					RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
			Dear Evelyn... It is cold here.  So cold,
			in a way that goes deep into your bones.

	The Messerschmidt in Rafe's sights breaks apart with the
	stream of precise fire he pours into it, its prop flying into
	pieces, its disintegration accelerated by its airspeed.
	Before it completely comes apart, it explodes.

	Rafe goes into another tight turn, to get at them again.

					RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
			It's not easy making friends.  Two nights
			ago I drank a beer with a couple of the
			R.A.F. pilots -- beer's the only thing
			here that isn't cold -- and yesterday both
			of them got killed...

	As Rafe starts another attack we see him in the cockpit, in
	the trance of battle, as other Spitfires around him are
	getting shot out of the sky...as we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Evelyn, receiving the letter at mail call.

	She sits on the grass under a palm tree, in paradise, reading
	his letter.

					RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
			There is one place I can go to find
			warmth, and that is to think of you.

	EXT.  OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - OAHU - DAY

	Evelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress.  She's
	let her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat
	in the tropical heat.

	The restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood
	posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor.
	Evelyn sits alone.  She's brought writing paper.  As the
	Hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with
	chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at
	the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen.

	But before she can start to write, three naval officers move
	over to her table from the bar.  They're out of uniform too,
	wearing garish tropical shirts.

					NAVY GUY 1
			A woman beautiful as you shouldn't be
			sitting alone.  Buy you a drink?

					EVELYN
			Thank you...Ensign.

	The guys look at each other, impressed that she could tell.

					NAVY GUY 1
			Ensign!  Smart too!

					NAVY GUY 2
			So how about that drink?  Or dinner?

					EVELYN
			Thank you, but...I really want to be
			alone right now.

					NAVY GUY 3
			Want to see something long and hard?

	He shows her the tattoo of an anchor on his forearm.  Evelyn
	looks away from them, toward the harbor.

					EVELYN
			I'm sorry.  I've got a letter to write.

					NAVY GUY 3
			Cold bitch.

	His friends start to pull him away, but Evelyn's eyes flare.

					EVELYN
			What did you say?

					NAVY GUY 3
			I said you're cold.

					EVELYN
			Cold?  No, I'm just thinking about a war.
			And maybe you should be too.

	They leave, shaking their heads.  Evelyn picks up her pen,
	and writes.

					EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)
			Dear Rafe... It's strange to be so far
			from you in body, and so close to you in
			spirit.  But if our spirits really give
			our bodies life, then you should know
			this:  Every night I look at the sunset,
			and try to draw the last ounce of heat
			from its long day...

	She looks toward the sunset now; then she writes again...

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - NIGHT

	Rafe brings his battered plane in for a landing...

	INT.  BRITISH AIRFIELD BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Rafe sits on his cot, reading her letter.

					EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)
			...and send it from my heart to yours.

	Rafe is startled as the Air Commander appears beside his
	bunk.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Air-Sea Rescue picked up Nigel.  He'll be
			back with us tomorrow.

	Rafe nods, glad to hear the news.  The Commander starts to
	walk away, then turns back.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Some of us look down on the Yanks for not
			yet joining this war.  I'd just like to
			say that if there are many more back home
			like you, God help anyone who goes to war
			with America.

	The Commander salutes, with his left hand.  And Rafe salutes
	too -- with his left hand.

	EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

	The White House looks somehow whiter and purer in the glow of
	1941.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	GENERALS, ADMIRALS, and other advisors sit around the
	polished table -- all males, in suits and in uniforms.  The
	door opens, and the men all stand.

	PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT appears, in a wheelchair, pushed
	by a huge black valet, GEORGE.  The President's legs are
	shriveled, braced with the iron supports that attach to his
	shoes and are apparent beneath the cloth of his pin-striped
	pants.  From the waist up Roosevelt is heavily muscled,
	powerful, and handsome even in his little spectacles.  The
	valet rolls him to the head of the table; he's speaking even
	before he settles in.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Please be seated, gentlemen.

	They sit, as one.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Churchill and Stalin are asking me what
			I'm asking you:  How long is America
			going to pretend the world is not at war?

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			We've increased supply shipments to them,
			Mr. President, and we're losing merchant
			vessels every day.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Shift in every destroyer and anti-
			aircraft weapon you can find.

					ADMIRAL
			Sir, our Pacific Fleet is already down
			to almost nothing.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Gentlemen, at this moment the nation of
			Hungry has a larger military then the
			United States.  We have no choice but to
			draw from whatever we can.

	EXT.  ESTABLISHING TOKYO - JAPAN - NIGHT

	INT.  JAPANESE HIGH COMMAND - NIGHT

	The Conference Room is similar to that of the White House.
	But this table is low and all the men sit on the floor.  And
	there are no civilians here; Japan is now a nation ruled by
	its warriors.

	The last man to enter the room and take his place is ADMIRAL
	YAMAMOTO.  Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of
	veneration and suspicion among the men of the war council.
	Yamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend
	Genda, who can't hide his fear.  Yamamoto glances to the far
	end of the table where NISHIKURA, chief of the War Council,
	sits glowering.  (Their discussion is in Japanese, with
	subtitles.)

					NISHIKURA
			So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us
			thought your education at an American
			university would make you too weak to
			fight the Americans.

					YAMAMOTO
			If knowledge of opponents and careful
			calculation of danger is taken as
			weakness then I have misunderstood what
			it means to be Japanese.

					NISHIKURA
			The time has come to strike!  Or to sit
			and let the Americans cut off our oil and
			our future.  I know what you whisper to
			the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans
			are strong.  Yet look at their leader.

	He motions to OYAMA, an intelligence analyst, who opens a
	file and lays out pictures of Roosevelt.

					OYAMA
			Franklin Roosevelt.  Born into great
			wealth.  Fifteen years ago, he was
			stricken with polio.  Now he cannot walk,
			or even stand without help.
			Photographers will not take pictures of
			him in his chair; Americans do not wish
			to know how weak their President is.

	Yamamoto makes a low grunt.

					NISHIKURA
			You have something to say, Yamamoto?

					YAMAMOTO
			The Council knows I have opposed fighting
			the Americans.  No matter how great our
			resolve, they have resources beyond ours.
			If we must go to war, there is only one
			way -- deal them a blow from which it will
			take them years to recover.  In that time
			we can conquer all of the Pacific, and
			they will have no choice but to ask for
			peace.

					NISHIKURA
			You see us as capable of such a blow?

					YAMAMOTO
			The Americans themselves have made it
			possible.  We will annihilate them in a
			single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

	The members of the war council are so pleased with Yamamoto
	that they bow to him.  Only Genda keeps his eyes raised long
	enough to see the sadness in Yamamoto's face.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AIR BASE - BARRACKS - DAY

	Danny Walker and his pilot buddies have just arrived; they
	enter the barracks, talking happily.

					RED
			If I ain't n-never on a b-boat again,
			it'll be too s-soon.

					BILLY
			Where are the women on this --

	Danny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that
	the other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their
	beds, sleeping off hangovers.  They wear Hawaiian shirts;
	they haven't shaved.

					RED
			They're s-still asleep!

	Danny pauses for a moment, then shouts --

					DANNY
			Drop your cocks and grab your socks,
			boys!  The terror of the skies are here!

	The sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their
	pillows.

					ANTHONY
			They're all drunk.

	One guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of
	the compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible
	taste from his mouth.  As his feet dangle over the side of
	the bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation
	reaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its
	bottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he
	blinks as if trying to remember how it got there.

	Danny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name, COMA.

					DANNY
			Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.

					COMA
			Where's that lizard?

					DANNY
			What lizard?

					COMA
			The one that slept in my mouth last
			night.

					DANNY
			What the hell happened to you guys?

	Coma is one of those drunks who speak as if he's always about
	to burp.

					COMA
			Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a
			big...pot.  Like...like...

					RED
			A m-missionary?

					COMA
			No, like...

	Coma emits a pukey, toxic burp that has Danny and his buddies
	wincing back from the fumes.

					DANNY
			This is an Air Base?  Where's your squad
			commander?

	The question soaks through to Coma's brain.  His right hand
	points...and his left hand points...in different directions.
	His hands float around in the air until finally both of them
	are indicating the same direction, behind his back.  In the
	bunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian
	shirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that
	protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him
	too.

	Danny and his buddies are speechless -- except for Red
	Strange.

					RED
			I th-think I'm gonna like it here.

					COMA
			You guys are new?

					DANNY
			Yeah.

					COMA
			Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about
			mai-tai's.

	Coma's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment
	he's looking for something under the bed.  Then he pukes.
	Danny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the
	barracks; his friends follow.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AIRFIELD - DAY

	Danny and his buddies stride up to the airfield.  It's full
	of fighter planes -- and they're all bunched together in
	clusters on the field.  Danny grabs a MECHANIC.

					DANNY
			Hey!  What is this, the planes all
			bunched up like that?

					MECHANIC
			The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This
			makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier
			to service.

					DANNY
			What about easier to hit in an air raid?

					MECHANIC
			Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four
			thousand miles away.  So you guys just
			arrived, huh?

					DANNY
			Yeah.

					MECHANIC
			We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!

	The mechanic walks off.  Danny and the guys are left standing
	on the tarmac.

					DANNY
			Well guys...I reckon there's just one
			thing to do...

	INT.  OAHU BAR - DAY

	Danny and the pilots are in Hawaiian shirts, their party in
	full swing.  A bucket-sized hollowed-out volcano sits in the
	middle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the
	crater.  It's full of booze -- or was; Danny and the other
	guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as
	the last liquid is sucked dry.

					RED
			More m-mai-tai's!

	Coma is sitting there with them, beside Red.

					COMA
			Absolutely right.

	Everybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in
	with the others.  Danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his
	own thoughts.  Billy and Anthony are doing the hula to the
	Hawaiian music playing.

					COMA
			No, you guys aren't doing it right.  It's
			in the hands.  They talk story.

	Coma stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures
	of his hula.

					COMA
			Fish swim in ocean... Happy in the Mother
			Sea... Girl, beautiful girl, with big
			jugs, walks into water...waves lapping at
			her thighs...

					ANTHONY
			I never knew those dances were so
			sophisticated.

					COMA
			...Fish nibble at her breasts...

	Coma's really into his dance, his hands over enormous
	imaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows --

					COMA
			A more beautiful girl walks by...

	The guys see Evelyn passing on the other side of the street,
	gorgeous in the sunshine.  Coma's hands start squeezing the
	imaginary breasts of his hula.

					BILLY
			Hey, isn't that Evelyn?

	Danny moves up to look.

					DANNY
			Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

					COMA
			You guys know her?!  I gotta have an
			intro!  Man, I'd like to --

	Danny's hand is suddenly around Coma's larynx.

					DANNY
			A friend of mine's in love with her.  So
			you don't even look -- not ever.

	Danny releases him and Coma staggers back to the table to
	nuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano.

	Danny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beautiful
	form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base
	hospital.  Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly
	Hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto
	the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full
	of the potent liquid.  He shouts to the whole room --

					DANNY
			I'm a better pilot than any son-of-a-
			bitch on this island!  So I'm the one to
			say this!  Here's to Rafe McCawley!  A
			better pilot...and a better man...than
			me.

	The other pilots drink up -- from glasses or from straws.

					OTHER PILOTS
			To Rafe.

	Danny drains the whole glass at one chug, and slams it down
	onto the table.  Then he blinks, puts a hand on his stomach,
	and frowns.  Coma recognizes the look.

					COMA
			Uh oh.  Volcanic eruption!

	Danny bends at the waist; his head obscured by the table.

					COMA
			Shit, he's puking on my feet!

					RED
			Well, you p-puked on his feet.

					COMA
			Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!

	INT.  ADMIRAL KIMMEL'S OFFICE - OAHU - DAY

	ADMIRAL KIMMEL is Commander of the American Pacific Fleet.

	Two members of his staff are standing uncomfortably in front
	of him, having delivered a message from the Joint Chiefs of
	Staff.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			...transfer twelve more destroyers to
			Atlantic Fleet, and all the available
			anti-aircraft weaponry?!  Washington has
			gone insane!

	Kimmel's STRATEGIC ANALYST speaks up.

					STRATEGIC ANALYST
			We've done what you ordered, Admiral, and
			war gamed the likely outcome of a
			Japanese attack against each of our major
			bases in the Pacific.  Wake, Guam,
			Midway, the Philippines.  In each case,
			we lose.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			You left out Hawaii.

					STRATEGIC ANALYST
			Pearl Harbor can't be attacked
			effectively from the air.  It's too
			shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.
			Pearl Harbor's safe.  It's everywhere
			else that we're vulnerable.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			Step up surveillance of Japanese
			communications.  They're gonna do
			something somewhere.  I can feel it.

	EXT.  THE SKIES ABOVE OAHU - DAY

	A seaplane takes tourists on an excursion above Pearl Harbor
	and around the island of Oahu.  One Japanese tourist shoots
	pictures rapidly...first of the ships as seen from overhead;
	then he leans to the other side of the plane and shoots
	pictures of the airfield below them.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Another Japanese tourist hikes through the hills above Pearl
	Harbor.  He takes an excellent camera from his picnic basket,
	and shoots pictures.

	CLOSE - THE PICTURES, being carried down a hallway, into --

	INT.  JAPANESE PLANNERS OFFICE - DAY

	The courier places the pictures onto the table in front of
	Yamamoto, Genda, and the other JAPANESE OFFICERS.

					GENDA
			Look at the ships -- all grouped.  Perfect
			targets!

					JAPANESE OFFICER
			And the planes!  They are -- what is that
			American expression?  Sitting geese?

					YAMAMOTO
			Sitting ducks.

					JAPANESE OFFICER
			How can they be so foolish?

					YAMAMOTO
			They think no one would be stupid enough
			to attack them at Pearl Harbor.

					GENDA
			Or perhaps they think no one is capable.
			Look at this...

	He moves to a diagram displayed on the wall -- a simple
	display showing water depth and ship displacement.

					GENDA
			Pearl Harbor's depth of only forty feet
			makes them feel safe.  A torpedo dropped
			from an airplane plunges to one hundred
			feet before it can level off.  That is a
			conventional torpedo.  But we have been
			experimenting.

	From a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden
	fins, attached to a circular metallic band.

					GENDA
			Wooden fins.  We are testing them
			tomorrow.

	EXT.  JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY

	Yamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet Japanese
	island, sunlit and pleasant.  They are gathered on the shore
	of the island's natural harbor.  Wooden targets -- basically
	huge plank barriers -- are sunk into the water like ships at
	anchor.  A squadron of Japanese planes zooms overhead, taking
	up attack positions.

					GENDA
			We have chosen this place because its
			depth is exactly the same as Pearl
			Harbor's.

	Genda speaks into a field radio.  A lone plane drops out of
	formation and goes into a low-level approach, speeding up and
	dropping its torpedo.

	BELOW THE SURFACE we see the torpedo as it plunges at two
	hundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea.  With the wooden
	fins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the
	sea floor.

	ABOVE THE SURFACE the planners see the path of the torpedo;
	it hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying THUNK.  The
	planners are impressed -- but Yamamoto is not satisfied.

					YAMAMOTO
			Uncharged torpedoes have different
			balance.

					GENDA
			I have arranged a live fire drill -- with
			your permission.

	Yamamoto nods; Genda speaks again into his radio, and another
	plane swoops down and drops a torpedo.  Genda holds his hands
	to his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though
	they wonder at the need.

	The torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening,
	and of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to
	toothpicks.

					GENDA
			Of course against a ship the explosion
			will not be dissipated, and will have
			more force.

	The planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they
	knew that all the time.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE - PILOTS' BARRACKS - NIGHT

	The pilots are getting slicked up.

					BILLY
			Are you sure they're here?

					ANTHONY
			If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!

	Red moves up beside him to frown at the mirror.  His hair is
	plastered down and parted, his uniform's immaculate.

					ANTHONY
			Looking good, Red.

					RED
			Shut up.

	Red moves away, to polish his shoes.

					ANTHONY
			What is it with Red?  I've never seen him
			this way.

					BILLY
			He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny,
			you coming?

					DANNY
			Nah, I'm gonna stay here.  Read.

	Anthony and Billy look at each other; Danny's in his bunk,
	and he's not reading, just staring at the ceiling.

	INT.  NURSES' BARRACKS - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	The nurses are primping to go out; Evelyn is in her uniform
	getting ready to go back to work.

					BARBARA
			Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I
			mean, you can put your hands on him if
			you want to, but then my hands will break
			yours.

					BETTY
			He was that good?

					BARBARA
			No, I was.

	EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - NIGHT

	Creeping through the vegetation, Red leads Anthony and Billy
	to a spot outside the nurses' barracks; they can see the
	girls through the barracks window.

					BILLY
			Red, Peeping Tom stuff can get us court-
			marshaled.

					RED
			Shhh!

	Anthony and Billy are baffled, even more so when Red strides
	into the open, right outside the nurses' window.

	And then, Red begins to sing.

					RED
				(singing)
			Oh...Betty, Betty, Betty, you're the one
			for me, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, can't
			you see...

	Anthony and Billy look at each other, dumbfounded.  The
	nurses move to the open windows.  Red's singing is pretty
	good -- though not that good.  But he doesn't stutter when he
	sings.

					RED
				(singing)
			I'll be yours for eternity, Betty, Betty,
			Betty, Betty, Betty!

	Anthony and Billy are hysterical, trying to keep their
	laughter hidden.  But then they see the effect this is having
	on the women -- especially on Betty.  She's smitten.

	Red repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he
	finishes, Betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses
	applaud.  They move off into the darkness, arm and arm.

	The nurses go back to their primping.

	Anthony and Billy are changed men.  Anthony stands up;
	Billy's baffled.  Anthony moves out and starts singing.

					ANTHONY
				(singing)
			Oh Sandra...I like you...love you...

	He's terrible.  The nurses pelt him with hairbrushes,
	curlers, shoes...

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY

	Coming out of the blustery skies at the end of another deadly
	day, a squadron of Spitfires chirps in for landings.  The
	planes are shot up and battered.

	Rafe is one of the pilots; the fuselage below his cockpit is
	marked with four swastikas, symbols of his victories.  He
	taxis to a stop, and is met by IAN, a Scottish mechanic, who
	is dismayed at the state of the plane.

					IAN
			Leapin' Jesus!

					RAFE
				(climbing down)
			The struts are loose, the hydraulics are
			leaking, and the electrical system's
			shorting out in the cockpit.

					IAN
			Well which of those three ya want fixed?

					RAFE
			All of 'em.

	Rafe starts away, and Ian calls to his back --

					IAN
			If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya
			should'a stayed in the bloody States!

					RAFE
			And if you don't give me a plane that can
			handle combat, you better start learning
			to speak German.

					IAN
			Fook ya!

					RAFE
			Learn English, then!

					IAN
			Fook ya dooble!

	Rafe moves to the barracks; Ian keeps the fueling hose going,
	and moves to help the armorers reload the guns.

	INT.  BRITISH AIRFIELD BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Rafe falls down onto his cot, exhausted.  The other pilots do
	the same, everybody spent from the day's combat.  Then they
	hear the SIREN.  Rafe's out of his bunk, with the others,
	everybody running.

					BRITISH PILOT
			Bloody Krauts!  Night raid!

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - NIGHT

	They race across the runway.  Rafe reaches his Spitfire, just
	as Ian is removing the fueling hose.

					IAN
			I have'na been able ta --

					RAFE
			Crank her!

	Ian gives the prop a spin, and the engine roars to life.

					IAN
			God speed ya, laddie.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - NIGHT

	It's dark, but there are breaks in the clouds, giving way to
	patches of light from a full moon.  The squadron of Spitfires
	tightens up for battle.

	Rafe is positioned just right of the squad leader; he sees
	planes breaking out of the dark clouds ahead.

					RAFE
			Here they come.

	The clouds break, revealing a huge attack formation.

					BRITISH SQUAD LEADER
			Alpha group, on the bombers!  Beta group,
			take the fighters!

	They peel off, into action.

	EXT.  THE AIR BATTLE OVER THE CHANNEL - NIGHT

	We stay with Rafe as he and the Squad Leader rush side by
	side at the lead bomber, blasting away with their guns.

	INT.  GERMAN BOMBER - IN THE AIR - NIGHT

	The Spitfires' bullets rip into the pilot and also kill the
	nose gunner; the bomber dips as the copilot struggles to take
	control.

	INT.  RAFE, IN HIS SPITFIRE - NIGHT

	As he streaks past, Rafe sees the bomber wobble in the air.

					RAFE
			We've got him hurt, stay on him!

	Rafe throws his plane into an ultra-tight, high speed turn,
	right between the tails of the leader German group and the
	noses of the second.  His turn is so tight that the plane
	flexes with the g-force.

	Rafe comes out of his turn ahead of the Squad Leader, and
	races back up through the formation of German bombers, moving
	above them where their weapons and armaments are the weakest.
	He stitches a trail of bullets from tail to nose of the
	wounded lead bomber; it begins to smoke.

	The second Spitfire, the Squad Leader's, takes fire from the
	other German bombers, and shears off, heading through the
	smoke of the plane Rafe has on the ropes.

					RAFE
			We've got him going!

	Rafe does a half-loop and half-spin, to bring him around to
	face the bombers again.  This time the g-force of the turn
	pops an oil line inside Rafe's cockpit; hot, pressurized oil
	begins to spray everywhere -- all over Rafe, his controls,
	and worst of all, over the inside of his cockpit glass.

	He wipes at the oil with his hands and that just smears it
	and makes it worse.

	His wingman sees him veering away from the bombers...and sees
	the German fighters moving up to meet him.

					SQUAD LEADER
			McCawley!  Get to the clouds!  Get into
			the clouds!

	RAFE, IN HIS PLANE, is flying blind.

					RAFE
			I can't see the clouds!

	His problems are just beginning; the fluid is dripping down
	onto his cockpit's corroded electrical wiring; the fluid
	causes an arc...a spark...and suddenly a fire is spreading
	through Rafe's plane.

	He grabs his fire extinguisher and triggers a cloud that
	snuffs the fire but fills the entire cockpit with choking
	smoke; between that and the smeared fluid on his glass, he
	can't see a thing.

	And the Messerschmidts are swarming over him.

	Rafe's wingman dives in, raking the German planes as he
	passes.

	Rafe tries to open his cockpit cover to clear the smoke, but
	it's jammed; he pulls out his .45 pistol and BLAM!  BLAM!
	BLAM!  He blows out the glass; the smoke clears enough for
	him to take a breath and try to see.  He fights the stick,
	but the plane won't respond.

	The Messerschmidts rake him again, bullets riddling his
	engine.

					SQUAD LEADER
			Get out of there, McCawley!  Get out of
			there!

	Rafe's plane descends, ever faster, passing through clouds,
	then clear air again.  The Squad Leader tries to chase and
	cover him, but Rafe's dropping fast, and still isn't out of
	the plane as the Germans dive on him again, firing.

	Rafe's Spitfire hits the broken fog over the water -- the
	Squad Leader loses sight of it for a moment -- and then the
	plane hits, splashing and exploding all at once.

	The Squad Leader winces, and ducks into the clouds as he
	reports on his radio...

					SQUAD LEADER
			McCawley down.  No 'chute.

	EXT.  BATTLESHIP WEST VIRGINIA - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The sailors have assembled on deck for the ship's heavyweight
	championship fight, a contest made more interesting to the
	sailors because one of the combatants is white and the other
	is black.

	The battle is more toughness than technique.  The guys
	throwing haymakers and shoving each other around the roped
	area, as their shipmates cheer and make wild bets.  The white
	guy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the
	black guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's
	belly, making him back up and say --

					WHITE BOXER
			You hit hard -- for a cook.

	The black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right
	cross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a
	fresh cut over his right eye.  The white guy now rushes in,
	and the black guy (his name is DORIE MILLER) throws an upper
	cut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks.

	The sailors cheer wildly.  Dorie steps back, and rubs his
	glove across his brow.  It's really bleeding now.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE - DAY

	Evelyn is returning from church with six of her nurse
	friends.  It's very quiet on a Sunday morning, almost nobody
	at the base; they walk along the path.

					BARBARA
			Let's get into civvies and find a bar.

					MARTHA
			Right after church?

					BARBARA
			You've gotta sin some, to get
			forgiveness.  Come with us, Evelyn.  You
			need some sin.

					EVELYN
			I've got to write some requisitions.
			We're undersupplied with morphine.

					BETTY
			Morphine?  We've been here a month and
			nobody's had worse than a sunburn.

	Evelyn smiles softly and walks toward the base hospital.

					BETTY
			I wish she could forget him.

					BARBARA
			You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Evelyn approaches the hospital and finds the black boxer
	peering in the window.  He's in a T-shirt and navy pants.

					EVELYN
			Can I help you, sailor?

	As Dorie turns, she sees the cut on his head, closed only
	with a band-aid; it's dripping blood down his T-shirt.

					DORIE
			'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors
			is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to
			look at this.

					EVELYN
			Our doctor's gone too.

					DORIE
			Sorry to trouble you.

					EVELYN
			Wait, let me look at that... You better
			come in here.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	Miller is sitting on a stool; Evelyn bathes the wound.

					EVELYN
			How'd you get this?

					DORIE
			Boxin'.

					EVELYN
			Win?

					DORIE
			Yes'm.

	He says it without pride.  She puts down the basin.

					EVELYN
			What's your name?

					DORIE
			Dorie Miller, 'Mam.

					EVELYN
			I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But
			I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs
			sewing, or else it's gonna make a big
			lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - LATER

	Evelyn clips the ends of her carefully applied stitches;
	Dorie's eyes are rolled up as if he could watch from inside
	his skull.

					EVELYN
			How often you fight like this?

					DORIE
			Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight
			champion of the West Virginia.

					EVELYN
			What do you get for winning?

					DORIE
			Respect.

	She hands him a mirror.  He studies her work.

					DORIE
			No doctor would'a give me that good.

	She walks him to the door.

					DORIE
			Thank you, 'Mam.

					EVELYN
			Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big
			as you -- and smart too, you knew where
			to come when your ship couldn't help --
			do you still have to fight with your
			fists to get respect?

					DORIE
			I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be
			a man.  They made me a cook -- and not
			even that, really -- I clean up after the
			other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's
			shoes.  In two years, they've never even
			let me fire a gun.

	Now Evelyn understands.

					EVELYN
			You take care, Dorie.

					DORIE
			You too, 'Mam.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - SUNSET

	Dorie walks away, down the path between the palm trees.  She
	watches him go, and then is transfixed by someone else
	coming, silhouetted by the light of the setting sun.  She
	can't make out his face, but he's wearing a pilot's dress
	uniform, and coming to her right out of the warm orange
	sunset that she has stared at so many times.  Her heart slams
	against her ribs; she takes a few steps forward.

					EVELYN
			...Rafe...

	She moves toward him, and he draws near her, walking slowly.
	And then she sees his face...

	It's Danny.  His face as sad as death itself.

	And even before he tells her, she knows.

					DANNY
			Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe
			McCawley's best friend.

					EVELYN
			Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were.
			Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's
			why you've come.

	EXT.  A BENCH - OVERLOOKING PEARL HARBOR - SUNSET

	Evelyn and Danny sit on the bench, with a sweeping view of
	the harbor and the lights winking on all around it as the sun
	settles beyond the horizon.  Evelyn is stoic, numb; Danny is
	the one who is struggling.

					DANNY
			Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the
			one to tell you, if it happened.

					EVELYN
			He told me about you.  That he had no
			other friend like you.

					DANNY
			Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business,
			owned their own planes.  Real straight,
			frugal.  My father was the town drunk.
			Went to sleep one night on the railroad
			tracks and was still there when the Dawn
			Express came along.  Rafe and I were the
			only ones at the funeral.  He took me
			back to his house, and I never left.

					EVELYN
			You were more like brothers.

					DANNY
			I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me
			how to fly.

					EVELYN
			He said you're the only one he ever saw
			who was better in the air than him.

					DANNY
			...He said that?

	Evelyn nods, still staring away from Danny.  This pierces
	Danny; he looks away, struggling not to let the emotions pull
	him completely under.

					DANNY
			Look, uh...Rafe's dad...he wrote me with
			the news, and it took me a couple of days
			to work up the guts to come here and tell
			you.  I'm not as brave as Rafe, or as
			noble.  But if there's anything I can
			ever do to help -- you let me know, okay?

	She stares into the distance.  He stands and puts his hand on
	top of hers, as much for his comfort as for hers.

					DANNY
			I understand why Rafe loved you.  You're
			as strong as he was.

	Since she's still not looking at him, he starts to move away.
	When he reaches the turn in the path, he looks back, and sees
	her figure in the gathering darkness.  She's begun to break
	down; and as he watches, her whole body starts convulsing,
	and she doubles up in shattering grief.

	Danny can't just stand there; he moves back to her, and puts
	a hand on her shoulder.  He sits beside her again, and
	suddenly she turns to him and sobs upon him.  Danny wraps her
	gently in his arms, and then he breaks down, having found the
	first place he can truly grieve.

	EXT.  JAPANESE BOMBING PRACTICE - JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY

	The Japanese have constructed a replica of Pearl Harbor on
	their practice island; erecting new target barriers and
	silhouettes of the various ships anchored at Pearl.  Streams
	of Japanese planes skim overhead in practice bombing runs,
	dropping dummy torpedoes and bombs.  From a control platform
	erected on the beach, Yamamoto and Genda oversee it all.

					YAMAMOTO
			Everything real except the fact that no
			one is shooting back at us.

					GENDA
			If we achieve surprise, they will offer
			little resistance.

					YAMAMOTO
			Set up teams of radio operators to send
			out messages the Americans will
			intercept, concerning every potential
			American target in the Pacific.  Include
			Hawaii -- the clutter will be more
			confusing that way.

					GENDA
			Brilliant, Admiral.

					YAMAMOTO
			A brilliant man would find a way not to
			fight a war.

	He looks out at the planes roaring into his practice harbor
	at top speed...

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Roosevelt's valet leans over him.

	Roosevelt wakes; beside the valet is a Presidential AIDE.

					AIDE
			Mr. President, we've received a message
			from the Argentinian ambassador to Japan.
			His sources tell him the Japanese are
			assembling their fleet to attack us.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			We're picking up warnings for every
			American base in the Pacific.  Does this
			ambassador know the target?

					AIDE
			Not for sure.  But he thinks it's Pearl
			Harbor.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Tell the Pentagon.

	The Aide leaves quickly and Roosevelt starts to get out of
	bed; his valet comes to help him.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			No, George, I need the practice, in case
			there's a fire.

	Roosevelt drags himself out of bed, crawling toward the
	bathroom, his powerful arms dragging his lifeless legs.

	INT.  PENTAGON - DAY

	ADMIRALS and other OFFICERS are gathered around a giant map
	of the Pacific.

					ADMIRAL
			The attack seems inevitable.  The
			question is where?  The way to answer
			that question is to ask:  if we were the
			Japanese, how would we do it?

	He nods to a VICE ADMIRAL, who stands over the map.

					VICE ADMIRAL
			Between America and the Far East are the
			sea lanes where the winds and the
			currents make the best route for
			shipping.  Far above is the northern
			route, between Canada and Russia.
			Between these two is something they call
			the Vacant Sea.  If I were the Japs, I'd
			send a task force there.  You could hide
			the entire land mass of Asia in the
			Vacant Sea, and nobody would know.

					ADMIRAL
			So they pop out and attack where?

					VICE ADMIRAL
			That's the problem, Admiral.  They could
			hit anywhere they want.

	Nobody has any solution.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

	A huge Japanese fleet steams toward Hawaii.  It is an awesome
	sight.  Carriers, battleships, destroyers, and entire battle
	group, traveling under complete radio silence, their hulls
	power through the waves.  On the lower decks of the carriers
	are hundreds of planes -- fighters and bombers.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The American ships are lined up at anchor, calm, placid.

	EXT.  BEACH - DAY

	The sailors and soldiers bask in the sun, play volleyball.

	The aircraft carrier Lexington steams past toward the harbor
	entrance.

					VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 1
			Where's the Lexington going?

					VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 2
			Out on maneuvers, like the Enterprise.

	EXT.  GOLF COURSES - OAHU - DAY

	Men in military haircuts -- officers -- stroll the golf
	courses, enjoying themselves.

	INT.  DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

	The DENTIST, an ethnic Japanese, is working on a patient with
	his mouth agape.  The DENTIST ASSISTANT intrudes.

					DENTAL ASSISTANT
			Dr. Takanawa, you have a call from Tokyo.

					DENTIST
			Please excuse me.  Just relax.

	Leaving his patient with a mouth full of instruments, the
	Dentist moves to his outer office, which looks directly out
	over Pearl Harbor.  He speaks in Japanese.

					DENTIST
			Takanawa... Yes?...

	He seems confused by the call, but he responds by looking out
	over the harbor, then saying into the receiver --

					DENTIST
			Yes, they are all...no wait, I see the
			big one moving.  The one that's flat on
			top, what do they call it?...

	INT.  SURVEILLANCE BASE - DAY

	Some tired Army Intelligence types -- A LISTENER, a TRACKER,
	and an INTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR, are sitting at a bank of
	phones.  The LISTENER is a Japanese-American.

					LISTENER
			Here's something, over the line from
			Tokyo.

	He switches on the recording equipment and looks to the
	TRACER, sitting at a battery of equipment.

					TRACER
			It's connected to a local dentist.  His
			office is beside Pearl Harbor.

					INTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR
			This dentist, is he a spy?

					LISTENER
			Sounds too innocent.  His accent is from
			the old country.  Somebody official-
			sounding calls, he thinks it's
			discourteous not to respond.

	INT.  BARBER SHOP - DAY

	Admiral Kimmel is settling into the barber chair when his
	AIDE enters and nods for the barber to move a few paces away,
	so that he can speak privately.

					AIDE
			Sir, we just had an intelligence
			intercept.  Someone from Tokyo called a
			local dentist whose office looks over
			Pearl.  They wanted to know the exact
			location of the ships.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			Someone from Tokyo asks a dentist how the
			ships are sitting... What are we supposed
			to do about that?

					AIDE
			I...don't know, Sir.  But it just seemed
			significant.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			Have intelligence keep monitoring him.

	The Admiral sinks back into the chair.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	A young amateur PHOTOGRAPHER, about 16, wearing a hat with
	"PICTURES OF PARADISE" printed on it's crown is ready to snap
	a shot of Evelyn and her nurse friends having a picnic lunch
	on the lawn outside the hospital.

					PHOTOGRAPHER
			Closer, ladies!  Closer!  Now smile!...
			Great!  Next week I'll show you a print
			and you can order your Pictures of
			Paradise!

	He hustles off.  Betty hands out picnic baskets.

					BETTY
			Barbara, here's yours...and Evelyn, here
			you are.

	Evelyn opens her basket, and finds a lei of Hawaiian flowers
	stuffed in the top.  Betty scoots over and puts the flowers
	around Evelyn's neck.

					BETTY
			It's been a month and you haven't smiled.
			We just want you to know we love you.

	Evelyn's touched -- but before she can react two P-40's zoom
	out of the skies, wings clipping the tops of the palm trees
	as they blast over head.

	INT.  COCKPIT'S OF THE P-40'S - DAY

	Danny and Anthony are the pilots; as they pull up and away,
	they pass over some officers on the golf course, scaring the
	shit out of them as they putt.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	The nurses have sprawled to the ground; now even Evelyn is
	smiling.

					BARBARA
			What is it with nurses and pilots?

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - EVENING

	Evelyn walks out of the hospital.  She's still wearing her
	lei.  The sun is going down in a spectacular sunset.

	She stares at the orange glow at the edge of the world.  She
	breathes in the sea air, and tries to breathe out the
	sadness.  The water of the harbor laps close to where she
	stands, the sunset polishing its surface.

	She takes the lei from her neck, plucks a single flower, and
	holds it like the rose Rafe once gave her.  Then she tosses
	the rest of the lei into the ocean and watches it float away,
	as the sun sinks behind the horizon.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Evelyn finds her purse, and tucks the flower into it.  She's
	alone in the hospital, everyone else has gone; she turns her
	mind toward work, something to lose herself in.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE - NEAR THE PILOTS' BARRACKS - DAY

	Danny is walking toward the barracks when a COLONEL hopping
	mad, confronts him.

					COLONEL
			You're Walker, right?

					DANNY
			Yes Sir.

					COLONEL
			That was a nice little stunt you pulled,
			buzzing the base.

					DANNY
			You liked that?

					COLONEL
			Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting
			you out of the squadron.

					DANNY
			Sir?

					COLONEL
			I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you
			and your buddies are gonna transfer your
			planes up to Haleiwa.

					DANNY
			Hale-what?

					COLONEL
			You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just
			lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.

					DANNY
			Sir, I --

					COLONEL
			Too late for apologies, Walker.

					DANNY
			I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was
			just gonna say it was worth it to feel
			like a real pilot again, even if it was
			only for five seconds.

	The Colonel glares at him and stalks away.

	INT.  BASE CANTEEN - NIGHT

	Danny and Evelyn are having coffee at the base canteen.

					DANNY
			How's everything?

					EVELYN
			We got some soldiers in traction from a
			jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except
			for the occasional fighter plane buzzing
			us.

					DANNY
			That might not have been such a good
			idea.  They're making us fly out of a
			half-paved airfield.  The real punishment
			is that I won't be back to the barracks
			till it's too late for dinner or coffee.
			So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.

					EVELYN
			I was just thinking that war is a series
			of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why
			we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to
			Rafe?

					DANNY
			I swore not to talk about him tonight,
			but there's all this stuff I think I
			ought to tell you, that he didn't get a
			chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He
			had such high expectations of himself
			that he always felt empty.  The week he
			met you he told me he felt his heart had
			always lived in winter, and for the first
			time in his life he has seen the spring.

	He's been lost in his own thoughts of Rafe; now he notices
	the tears welling up in her eyes.

					DANNY
			Sorry.

					EVELYN
			He told me he didn't want to leave me
			with regret.  Now that's all I have.

					DANNY
			Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?

					EVELYN
			Well...sure.

					DANNY
			From the air?

	EXT.  HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT

	A P-40 takes off from the remote airfield, lit only by the
	full moon.

	INT.  P-40 - NIGHT

	Evelyn sits on Danny's lap, like Rafe sat in his Daddy's lap
	years before.  Danny flies easily, the cockpit open, his arms
	slipped under hers.

	The sky above them is startlingly clear; a billion stars
	dancing around a full moon.

					EVELYN
			So beautiful!

					DANNY
			Hang on.

	He spins the plane in an easy half turn, inverting their
	heads above Pearl Harbor, gorgeous in the moonlight, the
	battleships aglow, the moon reflected in the peaceful water,
	embraced by the island of Oahu.

	EXT.  HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT

	The P-40 soars easily in and settles to earth.  Danny shuts
	down the engine.  Danny carefully removes the harness around
	her.  She looks overhead.  The stars are still bright above
	them.

					EVELYN
			I didn't realize until tonight that I've
			stopped wanting to live.

	She turns in his lap, and looks at him.  Their eyes connect.
	Tentatively, almost reluctantly, they kiss.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	The POV of someone moving through the gathering darkness
	approaches the hospital.

	The lights from within the hospital, and the pristine white
	beds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow,
	where Evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina in a
	giant's jewel box.

	Now we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and can
	tell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't tell
	who.  He's standing dead still, transfixed in watching Evelyn
	through the windows.

	INT.  BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Evelyn moves to her desk, and sits down.  She looks at the
	calender turning back to October, where she wrote on the
	square of October 22, "Order supplies" -- she counts the
	weeks from then to today, December 6.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	We see the full figure of the man watching her.  And now we
	see his face.  It is Rafe.

	His left hand is bandaged, but he is very much alive --
	though seeing Evelyn has taken his breath, and even seems to
	have robbed him of the power to move.  His eyes pick up every
	detail of her -- her face...her hands.

	And as Rafe watches Evelyn, he has the SUDDEN JOLTS OF
	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS...punctuated by fragments of the letter
	she wrote to him, and INTERCUT with Rafe in the present,
	watching Evelyn.

					EVELYN'S VOICE
			Dearest Rafe --

	IN SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK, RAFE'S SPITFIRE, crippled and
	trailing smoke, passing through a patch of cloud as Rafe
	hurls himself from the cockpit and jerks the ripcord of his
	chute.

	IN THE PRESENT...Rafe's face winces with the memory, and he
	rivets his eyes on Evelyn, as if to force himself to know
	that this moment is real.

	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK...RAFE LANDS IN THE WATER, and the shock
	of its coldness travels up his body faster than his body
	sinks into the water.  He's cloaked in the fog; his
	parachute, pushed by the wind, is pulling him along face
	down.  He fights with the straps, flips himself over, and
	pulls the release...

	But he's still in desperate trouble; in his flying clothes,
	his heavy leather jacket soaking with sea-water, he's going
	down; his body sinks beneath the surface...

					EVELYN'S VOICE
			...Every sunset...

	IN THE PRESENT, Rafe's chest trembles... Is it from the
	memory of the frozen water, from the emotion of seeing Evelyn
	again -- or both?

	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS -- Below the surface of the North Sea,
	Rafe's body drifts, but he fights his way back up...he kicks
	off his shoes, sheds the jacket, strips off his pants and
	starts tying the cuffs into knots.

	Then, in a CUT, he is floating in the water, his pants turned
	into a makeshift life preserver, his body shaking
	convulsively from the cold.

	Then in another CUT we see him after he's been in the water
	for so long that his body no longer trembles; he's lost
	consciousness.  He has no strength, no will to live... His
	face settles into the water...his body slips from his
	preserver, and drifts beneath the surface...

					EVELYN'S VOICE
			...gather it's heat into my heart, and
			send it to you...

	IN FLASHBACK, Rafe beneath the surface... His eyes come open.
	From his POV beneath the water, he sees something above the
	surface.  It's only in his mind, but that makes it no less
	real...an orange glow, the warmth of the sunset, and her face
	above the surface... His limbs come to life, and he fights
	his way up, breaking the surface.  The whole sea around him
	is dark and empty, but he grabs his makeshift preserver and
	holds on for dear life...and for Evelyn.

	IN THE PRESENT Rafe stares through the window, at Evelyn, but
	he can't go in.  He backs away from the window.

	INT.  PILOT'S BARRACKS - NIGHT

	A Japanese-American MESSAGE BOY parks his motorbike outside
	and enters the barracks.

					MESSAGE BOY
			Daniel Walker?...

	Danny rises from his bunk and accepts the telegram.  As the
	message boy leaves, Danny reads... The news he learns stuns
	him...

	EXT.  BENCH - OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Rafe is still lost in thought.  He hears steps running up --
	and sees Danny -- who spots him at the same moment.

					DANNY
			Rafe!

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Evelyn puts away the calender.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Rafe is sitting at the bench, his head down.

	ANGLE - Evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench,
	his form hauntingly familiar.  He hears her, and looks up.
	It's Rafe.

	From Evelyn's POV, the whole world spins.  She faints.

	Rafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground.  He
	gathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face.
	He's real, very real.

					RAFE
			Evelyn.

	She's trembling, shaking.  He lifts her to her feet, and
	moves her to the bench.

					RAFE
			I sent telegrams, I guess the military
			traffic held them up.

					EVELYN
			Why were you sitting here, instead of...

					RAFE
			I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just
			stood there wondering if you knew.  You
			looked...sad, and I had to sit down a
			minute.

					EVELYN
			How did you?...

					RAFE
			...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog,
			and nobody could see me.  I hit the water
			hard.  And it was so...cold.

	He looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades
	to black.  There's something he thinks about saying, and
	doesn't.  Then...

					RAFE
			I don't know how long I was in the water.
			A Norwegian freighter picked me up.  They
			were headed to Spain.  They docked in La
			Rota, right beside a German ship, and
			told me to stay hidden below.  I was
			afraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some
			clothes, jumped ship, and found a church,
			where the priest contacted the
			resistance, and got me on a freighter to
			New York.

	He looks at her, then looks down again.

					RAFE
			I called my folks, then Colonel
			Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to
			pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me.
			I told the Colonel I needed to see
			somebody first, and he had a supply
			flight heading out in an hour.
				(beat)
			I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't
			said anything.

					EVELYN
			I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know
			that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't
			you?

					RAFE
			Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.

	At these words, she looks at him for a long, long moment.

					EVELYN
			It's been...so different, being so sure
			you were dead.

					RAFE
			I'm so sorry for what you must've gone
			through, but I'm back.

	He sees the troubled look on her face.

					RAFE
			Maybe I've assumed too much.  Has
			something changed?
				(beat)
			I'm afraid to ask what.  And I'm afraid
			not to.
				(beat)
			Have you fallen in love?

	She nods; she can't even say it.  Rafe's dying inside.

					RAFE
			It's all right.  Danny always said I see
			things with my emotions instead of my
			eyes.

					EVELYN
			It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I
			wrote you, they --

					RAFE
			Don't worry about that.  Guys away from
			home, lonely, good-hearted women try to
			cheer them up.

					EVELYN
			It's not that I didn't mean everything I
			wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you
			were dead.  And now --

	Danny runs up, through the darkness.

					DANNY
			You're alive!

	Rafe and Danny stare at each other; Danny hesitates, looking
	from Rafe to Evelyn, wondering what they've said.  Then Rafe
	looks at Evelyn, and picks up the look on her face.  In that
	moment he puts it all together.

					RAFE
			Aw, God.  Oh my God.

	Danny's speechless, and for a moment Evelyn is too.

					EVELYN
			Rafe --

	He puts up a hand, to silence her, and walks away suddenly.
	Evelyn and Danny are left frozen.

	EXT.  SHORE OF PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe stares out at the harbor, seeing nothing.  As he stands
	there alone and shattered, he has one more

	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK

	Rafe is in the water of the North Sea; he seems dead, but his
	makeshift preserver is keeping his face above the surface.
	Something slides through the water and stops beside him; it's
	a dinghy, and behind it is a trawler.

	Hands grab Rafe and drag him onto the dinghy...

	In a QUICK CUT, Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the
	trawler.  The crewmen think he's dead.  His body is stiff,
	his lips white; and they say so, in Norwegian...

	But one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid,
	then quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses
	back an eyelid to see his pupils.  Rafe's white lips move.
	The crewmen realize he's trying to say something.

	And Rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the
	Norwegian crewmen don't understand.

					RAFE
			Evelyn...

	IN THE PRESENT Rafe struggles to bury that memory so far that
	he'll never feel it again.

	EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Danny escorts Evelyn back to her quarters.

					DANNY
			Don't worry.  I'll find him.

	He hugs her; their embrace earnest yet tingled with guilt,
	and Danny leave quickly.  Betty steps out of the nurses'
	quarters and hands Evelyn a telegram.

					BETTY
			This came while you were gone.

	Evelyn knows it's the telegram from Rafe, to tell her he's
	alive.  Without opening it, she begins to cry, and hurries
	away from the barracks so the other nurses won't see.

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - NIGHT

	Danny crosses the tarmac toward the clustered P-40's.  He
	spots what he's looking for.  Sitting in the cockpit of one
	of the P-40's is Rafe.  Rafe won't look at him.  Danny climbs
	up on the wing, and sits down there.

					DANNY
			You'd always go sit in a plane whenever
			you were upset.

					RAFE
			Upset?  Why should I be upset?

					DANNY
			Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're
			scared to talk about it.

	CLOSE - A Mai-Tai volcano clunks onto a table.

	INT.  FUNKY OAHU BAR - DAY

					DANNY
			Drink up.  Then we'll talk.

	Rafe takes the challenge, and takes a long pull on one of the
	straws.  Red, Anthony, Billy, and several others enter the
	bar.

					ANTHONY
			Rafe?!

	They rush the table...

	INT.  FUNKY OAHU BAR - LATER

	They're all drinking, and the whole bar is rocking.  Rafe
	uses glasses to show his buddies tactics.

					RAFE
			They'll go under you because their planes
			are faster, then they run so you can't
			catch 'em.  But then they'll come around
			and take you from behind -- like some
			Americans will.

	The last words bring the group to silence.  The other guys
	drift away, to give them room.

					RAFE
			Sorry.

					DANNY
			Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's
			better to come out with it.

					RAFE
			I didn't mean it.

					DANNY
			Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you
			think.

					RAFE
			Waitress!  Four beers!

					DANNY
			You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.

					RAFE
			If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.

	The waitress delivers four bottles to the table.  Rafe takes
	a slow sip, then stares at Danny.

					RAFE
			We gotta face some facts here.

					DANNY
			What facts are those?

					RAFE
			I understand how it could happen.  I know
			why any guy would love her.  And I can't
			blame you that it happened.  You thought
			I was dead, she was grieving, you were
			trying to help her.

					DANNY
			I was grieving too.

					RAFE
			Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.

					DANNY
			So what are you saying?

					RAFE
			I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time
			for you to fuck off.

					DANNY
			You left her.  How's that for a fact?

					RAFE
			How's this for a fact?  I loved her
			first.

	Danny takes a long pull of beer, and Rafe does the same.

					DANNY
			You know, you're a lousy drinker.
			Drinking's supposed to make men feel
			bigger.  It only makes you stupid.  And
			weak.

	Rafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer.

					RAFE
			How's this?

	BAM!  He knocks Danny out of the chair, flat on his ass.
	Danny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth.

					DANNY
			You want it, you got it.

	He kicks Rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in
	the chest as he goes down, and the fight is on.

	The bar's bouncer, a big Samoan, moves over to break them up
	-- but Anthony steps in his way.

					ANTHONY
			Let 'em fight, they need it.

	The bouncer tosses Anthony aside, but before he can move in
	to interrupt the fight, Red breaks a lava volcano of Mai-Tai
	over the bouncer's skull.  The bartender picks up the phone
	to call the M.P.'s.

	Rafe and Danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the
	room.  Sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their
	stools to watch the action.  The other pilots are wincing
	with the punches their friends exchange, and bobbing and
	weaving as if in the fight themselves.  A SAILOR tapes Billy.

					SAILOR
			Is this a private fight or can anybody
			jump in?

	Billy hits him.  The whole bar erupts.

	Rafe and Danny are really having at it, fueled by so much
	emotion that nothing hurts.  They're on the floor now, trying
	to rip each other apart.  They struggle to their feet and
	Rafe manages to knee Danny in the balls.  Danny doubles over
	in pain.

					RAFE
			That hurt?  I didn't think you had any
			balls.

	Without looking up, Danny lunges at Rafe, tackling him around
	the waist, driving him at the wall.

	But they don't hit the wall; they tumble through the back
	window of the bar -- not covered in glass, but fronds and
	wood -- and out into the back alley.

	They're lying there in the debris when they see the M.P.
	jeeps coming.  They drag each other to their feet, and run
	away.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Japanese task force rumbles through the night, the bows
	of the great ships blasting through the crashing waves.

	INT.  AIRCRAFT CARRIER AKAGI - NIGHT

	Yamamoto's flagship.  The clock reaches midnight, and a
	sailor tears off it's calender.  It's December 7, 1941.

					YAMAMOTO
			The submarines will be reaching the
			harbor soon.  I hope they don't set off
			the alarm too soon.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	An American destroyer, the SELFRIDGE, leads a squadron of
	destroyers on patrol, near the entrance of Pearl Harbor.
	LOOKOUTS on the bridge think they spot something.

	INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DESTROYER SELFRIDGE - NIGHT

	The WATCH OFFICER listens to a report on his headset and
	turns to the CAPTAIN.

					WATCH OFFICER
			Captain, lookouts report a sighting, two
			points off the starboard beam.

	The sonar operator looks up and nods.

					SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN
			How big?

					SONAR OPERATOR
			...I've lost it.

					SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN
			Probably a blackfish.  I've seen them
			look like subs.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Another destroyer, the RALPH TALBOT, cruises behind the
	Selfridge.  On it's bridge, the DUTY OFFICER speaks to the
	CAPTAIN.

					DUTY OFFICER
			Sir, Selfridge reports a contact, then
			lost it.  Now our sonar reports the
			contact.

	The Captain looks toward the Selfridge, then trains his
	binoculars on the water were the Duty Officer points.  He
	sees something dark and black slipping along beneath the
	surface.  He gets onto his intercom.

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			Radio room!  Raise the Selfridge.  Tell
			the Squadron Commander we have spotted a
			sub and request permission to depth
			charge.

	He looks again at the black shape, passing a few hundred
	yards from them.

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			We're five miles from Pearl Harbor and
			it's moving in from the open sea.
			Prepare to move to attack speed.

	The INTERCOM comes alive.

					INTERCOM
			Sir, the Squadron Commander on Selfridge
			denies permission.

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			What?

					INTERCOM
			Denies, Sir.  He says it's a blackfish.

	The Captain chokes back his frustration and shuts down the
	intercom -- but then he says to the Duty Officer, as they
	watch the shape disappear toward Pearl Harbor...

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			If it's a blackfish, it has a motorboat
			up it's ass!

	EXT.  OAHU - ROAD - NIGHT

	Danny has pulled his Buick convertible off the road; Rafe is
	bent over, his head out of frame; he's throwing up.  Danny's
	banged up from the fight and still drunk himself; he waits
	beside Rafe, who chokes out between heaves --

					RAFE
			How come you're not pukin'?

					DANNY
			I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like
			throwing up every minute since you got
			back.

	Rafe straightens up, but the waves of sickness come back over
	him and he bends over again.  Danny looks at his friend, and
	the pain is written on Danny's face.

					DANNY
			Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like
			you're thinking.

					RAFE
				(between heaves)
			Fuck you.

					DANNY
			She loves you.  I know that.  And part of
			what she loves in me is how much of you
			she sees in me.

	Rafe doesn't seem to be listening; but Danny knows he is.

					DANNY
			We were both torn up.  I started dropping
			by to see her, because we understood what
			each other felt.  We'd have coffee and
			try not to talk about you, but we always
			would.

	Rafe stands to face Danny; this is hard for Danny to say.

					DANNY
			She said I was so much like you.  I said,
			No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of
			you, but I'm not you, not as good as you.
			Everybody else saw me as a loser with a
			big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw
			the better part of me, the part of me
			that could be like you, and changed me.
			You made me who I am.

					RAFE
			How sweet.  Is that when you put the move
			on her?

	Danny slams his fist into Rafe's sick gut.  Rafe doubles over
	again, coughing, nothing left in his belly to come up.

	Rafe stand slowly, nodding as if he knows the punch was what
	he deserved.  Danny's about to apologize when once more Rafe
	knees him in the balls.

	Danny folds up, drops to his knees, and starts to retch.

					RAFE
			That's better.

	Rafe crawls into the back seat of the car and passes out,
	Danny still collapsed at the side of the road.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

	The Japanese task force storms on.

	INT.  JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS - NIGHT

	A Japanese submarine with a midget sub attached to its hull
	runs silently toward Pearl Harbor.

	EXT.  OCEAN SURFACE - NIGHT

	The periscope of the submarine breaks the surface.

	INT.  JAPANESE SUB - NIGHT

	The sub commander looks through the periscope and sees the

					SUB COMMANDER
			Prepare to launch midget sub.

	INT.  BUNK AREA OF SUB, BETWEEN TORPEDOES - NIGHT

	The sailor who will drive the midget sub completes his

					SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)
			My revered father, I go now to fulfill my
			mission and my destiny.

	INT.  THE LAUNCH OF THE MIDGET SUB - NIGHT

	We see the sub surface, and the sailor exit the main hatch of
	the big sub, then force himself through the tiny hatch of the
	midget sub.

					SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)
			I hope it is a destiny that will bring
			honor to our family, and if it requires

	The plane climbs to a high altitude, toward the dawn and
	Pearl Harbor.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Japanese carriers turn into the wind and raise combat
	pennants.  A color guard raises the Japanese flag as the deck
	crew stand at attention, seeing the rising-sun flag snap
	potently in the wind.

	EXT.  JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS - NIGHT

	The first wave of Japanese planes begins to launch.  It is a
	stirring sight for the Japanese; the pilots waiting in their
	cockpits, the officers watching from the bridge, the seamen
	on the flight deck.

	The first plane taxis along the flight deck and lifts into
	the sky.  The seamen cheer and wave their caps.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	The American destroyer WARD cuts through the water, moving
	back into port after a night patrol.  It's CAPTAIN is on the
	bridge, and its lookouts are still scanning the waters.

					LOOKOUT
			Captain, do you see that, in our wake?

	The Captain raises his binoculars and looks out behind the
	ship.  He sees something small and black there.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
			That's a conning tower.

					OFFICER
			Could it be one of ours?

					CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
			He's trying to follow us through the sub
			nets, into the harbor.  Sink the son of a
			bitch.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE DESTROYER WARD - NIGHT

	The deck gun barks, aimed toward the conning tower of the

	INT.  THE SUB'S CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Japanese sub commander sees, through his periscope, the

					CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
			Fleet command, from destroyer Ward.  Have

	INT.  RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

	There are two guys left in the room, yawning over their new
	radar equipment.  The Officer, ELLIS, checks his watch; it's
	a few minutes after seven a.m.

					ELLIS
			Time to shut her down.  That was a good
			first session.  You'll get the hang of
			this new radar soon.

					PRIVATE
			Thank you, Sir.  Hey...what's this?

	His screen shows a huge cloud of blips, heading toward them.

					ELLIS
			I've never seen anything like that
			before.

	He gets on the telephone.

	INT.  ARMY HEADQUARTERS - DAWN

	The phone rings and an officer answers.

					OFFICER
			Watch command... Coming from which
			direction?... Hold on.

	He covers the phone and tells his commander --

					OFFICER
			Radar station has picked up a cloud of
			blips, coming in from the northeast.

	He switches on the radio, and tunes it to KGMB; hearing the
	Hawaiian music reassures him something...

					COMMANDER
			KGMB is on early.  That means we've got a
			flight of B-17's coming in from the
			mainland, they use the radio music for a
			homing beacon.

	INT.  RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

	Dismayed, Ellis listens to the response from the
	headquarters.

					ELLIS
			All right, Sir.
				(he hangs up)
			They say don't worry about it.

	He and the private look again at the cloud of blips --
	growing ever larger, and moving in fast.

	EXT.  THE SKIES ABOVE THE PACIFIC - DAY

	The Japanese formations are streaking through the sky.

	INT.  THE COCKPITS - DAY

	The Japanese bombers, with three-man crews, are listening to

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

	The Japanese scout plane is high in the air.  It radios --

					SCOUT PLANE PILOT

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE THE PACIFIC - DAY

	The Japanese planes increase throttle and nose down, diving
	toward the surface, hurtling into attack mode.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The harbor lies quiet.  It's a sleepy Sunday morning.
	Children are playing, officers are stepping from their houses
	in their shorts to get the morning paper...

	EXT.  MOUNTAINSIDE - OAHU - DAY

	Hawaiian Boy Scouts are hiking on a side of one of the
	mountains overlooking Pearl.

	Suddenly booming over the mountain, barely ten feet above the
	summit, comes a stream of planes.

	The boys are awed.  What is this?

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	QUICK INTERCUTS - Between the approach of the Japanese
	planes, and sleepy Pearl Harbor...

	-- The planes, in formation, their propellers spinning, their
	   engines throbbing...

	-- Pearl Harbor, with the ships silent, their engines cold,
	   their anchors steady on the harbor bottom.

	-- The Japanese submarines heading in.

	-- The American destroyers docking, instead of going out to
	   search for them.

	-- Another formation of Japanese bombers climbing high, into
	   attack position.

	-- The Japanese torpedo planes dropping down to the level of
	   the ocean, their engines beginning to scream.

	-- The American planes bunched on the airfields.

	-- ON THE JAPANESE CARRIERS, Yamamoto and his staff huddle
	   tensely, over their battle maps.

	ON THE JAPANESE CARRIER DECKS, the second wave of planes is
	being brought up and loaded with munitions...the Japanese
	flag snaps tautly in the wind...

	ON THE GOLD COURSE NEAR PEARL HARBOR, American officers are
	laughing on the putting green near the club house, where the
	American flag droops from the flag pole, limply at peace.

	-- The Japanese planes roaring down just over the wave tops
	   of Pearl Harbor itself.

	-- Children playing in the early morning sun, looking up as
	   they see the planes flash by.  The children look --
	   they've never seen this many, flying this low...but they
	   are not alarmed, only curious.

	The images come faster and faster, the collision of Japan's
	determination and American's innocence...

	EXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY

	Two sailors are standing on the deck, sharing a smoke,
	looking out over the quiet harbor.  One of them sees the
	first few planes streaking in.

					SAILOR 1
			Look at that.

					SAILOR 2
			It's the Army again, practicing on us.

	Something drops from the lead plane and splashes easily into
	the water; the plane banks away.

					SAILOR 2
			Practice torpedoes.

	A white streak runs through the water at them.

					SAILOR 2
			Now listen, you'll hear a little thud
			when it hits the side of the ship.

	They watch it rush at them...then, a MASSIVE EXPLOSION!  It
	throws up a fifty foot wall of water, hurling the sailors and
	everything else on the deck into the sea.

	EXT.  THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	-- The first wave of planes drop more torpedoes; they plunge
	   BENEATH THE SURFACE, their wooden fins working perfectly,
	   the torpedoes speeding to their targets...

	We see their AWESOME BLASTS against the anchored ships as the
	torpedoes hit home.

	-- The Japanese LOW ALTITUDE BOMBERS come in; some drop their
	   bombs directly into the ships; some skip their bombs
	   across the water, the bombs glancing off the surface and
	   then slamming the sides of battleships with tremendous
	   explosions.

	-- INSIDE THE SHIPS, sleeping sailors are thrown from their
	   bunks; those already awakened run for their battle
	   stations, and try to make it up to the deck; but there's
	   no escape there, as...

	-- Zero fighter planes strafe the ships, raking the decks and
	   killing sailors with MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	EXT.  ON THE AMERICAN SHIPS - DAY

	Fire and smoke are turning everything into chaos.  some
	sailors rush to man the guns, they find the ammo boxes
	locked.

	Under the bombing and strafing, they find a wrench and start
	pounding on the lock, trying to break open the ammo box.
	Then they break open the lock -- and find the ammo box empty.

					SAILOR
			Shit!  I'll get some ammo!

	He runs for the ladders, and is shot down before he gets
	there.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The dive bombers scream in.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Bombs are hitting the deck.  Sailors are blown into the air

	INT.  BELOW DECKS OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie Miller, the boxing champion/kitchen helper, is working
	picking up the breakfast trays when he feels the ship
	shudder.  The intercom comes alive --

					INTERCOM
			Battle stations!  Battle stations!  This
			is not a drill!

	Men run to the ladders, and the shaking of the ship from a
	bomb blast tosses them off; Dorie's at the foot of the ladder
	when men fall back on top of him.

	EXT.  BRIDGE OF WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	The Captain of the ship has reached the command bridge, where
	most of his staff is lying wounded from a bomb blast.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Stay calm!  Find your positions.  Medics,

	MORE TORPEDOES and BOMBS blast into the ship.  A big chunk of

	The medics he was just directing to other men now run to him,
	as the men they were going to help have been blown apart.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Sailors run up from below and are gunned down and blasted
	down before they can reach their weapons.

	Dorie Miller emerges from below decks and sees the carnage,
	the confusion.  A bloody OFFICER grabs him.

					BLOODY OFFICER
			Boy!  We need stretcher bearers on the

	Dorie runs into the fire and smoke, toward the bridge.

	EXT.  BRIDGE OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie arrives to see the medics crouched over the
	disemboweled Captain, who is still giving orders.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Radio for air cover.  Organize the other
			medics.  Initiate fire control.

	Dorie helps the medic lift the Captain to take him below.

	INT.  BELOW DECKS OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie carries the Captain down the ladder by himself, using
	one arm to climb and one to hold the Captain like a child's
	teddy bear.  When they reach the bottom the pain has grown
	too much for the Captain; he know's he's dying.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Put me down here.

	Dorie puts him down; the medic jumps down the ladder and
	reaches the Captain, who tells him --

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Find my executive officer and tell him
			he's in command.  Tell him to fire the
			boilers and...

	He trembles in death throes...

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Make sure the gunners have enough
			ammuni --

	He's dead.  The Medic runs toward the ladder, reaches the
	hatch, and is blasted back to the bottom by an explosion
	overhead.

	Dorie runs for the ladder, and climbs out into hell.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie emerges into even greater carnage and confusion.  A
	sailor, his body on fire, runs past and leaps into the oily
	water -- but it is in flames too.

	Then Dorie sees it:  an unmanned anti-aircraft gun.  He runs
	to it, through the strafing.

	The gun already has a belt of ammo in it -- apparently loaded
	by the gunner who lies beside it with his chest shot open.
	Dorie swings the business end of the gun toward the Zeros
	coming in out of the smoke, and he begins to fire.

	The Zeros keep coming and he keeps firing; nothing on earth
	will knock him from that gun.

	INT.  NURSES' BARRACKS - DAY

	Evelyn is up, dressed; her roommates are just stirring.

	EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - DAY

	Evelyn has stepped to the door when she hears a distant
	rumble and looks across the harbor to see smoke rising, ships
	taking hits.

					EVELYN
			Oh my God... EVERYBODY TO THE HOSPITAL!

	As she runs, Japanese planes are coming toward the base.

	EXT.  THE MESS HALL AT HICKAM FIELD - DAY

	The men were sitting down to breakfast, but the machine gun
	bullets tearing up the outer walls have them clogging the
	doors, and it's so clogged they can't all get out.

	A steel bomb crashes through the roof and slams through the
	room, taking out tables and chairs before bouncing off the
	wall and coming to a stop.

	TWO SOLDIERS, trapped within the mess hall, see it stop
	without detonating.  They are bug-eyed, hearts stopped.

					MESS HALL SOLDIER
			Dud.

	The bomb detonated, blowing everything to bloody dust.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

	Evelyn reaches the hospital first and runs to the cabinet,
	withdrawing supplies.

	Barbara and Sandra appear at the far door, both terrified.

					EVELYN
			Get everything out!  Bandages, sutures --
			oh God, the men in traction... Come with
			me!

	She races into the hallway, the other two following.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - TRACTION WARD - DAY

	Four men from a jeep accident are lying in traction, their
	casted limbs roped in the air.  Evelyn runs in, grabbing a
	razor blade from the medical cabinet -- and telling Barbara
	and Sandra.

					EVELYN
			Cut them down, and take cover!!  Hurry!

	Bombs are falling outside, on the airfield this wing of the
	hospital faces.  Evelyn slices the traction ropes of a man
	with both legs broken; ignoring his groans, she rolls him out
	of the bed and covers him with the mattress.  The other
	nurses follow her lead.  The bombs are coming toward the
	hospital ward; Evelyn finishes with the fourth man and covers
	him and herself with the mattress, just as a bomb craters
	outside the window.

	The nurses and patients look up after the explosions have
	passed; there's a chunk of smoking shrapnel lying on the
	springs of the bunk where the last man had been lying.

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - DAY

	The Japanese low-altitude bombers, with Zero escorts, zoom in
	over the field, blasting the clusters of American warplanes,
	whole squadrons taken out with one bomb.

	The mechanics and pilots, caught in the open, run from the
	strafing.  The Zeros rake them down with machine gun fire.
	It's carnage.

	EXT.  PHOTOGRAPHER'S HOUSE - DAY

	Sammy, the amateur photographer, is leaving his house for a
	morning of working his "Pictures of Paradise" business, when
	he sees the Japanese formations rumbling toward Pearl.  He
	races back inside.

	INT.  PHOTOGRAPHER'S HOUSE - DAY

	He fishes into his drawer for a film camera, and digs out
	cans of film, struggling to load it as he runs back out.

	INT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY

	The pilots of Danny's squadron have returned from their night
	of drinking and brawling and are crashed on their bunks.  Red
	stirs and staggers toward the head; he bumps into the wall,
	backs up like a wind-up toy and lurches blindly forward
	again, into --

	INT.  BARRACKS - THE HEAD - DAY

	Red sleepwalks to the urinals and unleashes a marathon piss
	stream, still in his sleep.  A rumble penetrates his brain,
	and his eyes come open a fraction.  Through the window slits
	above the urinals, he can see a cloud of Japanese planes
	rushing past.

	He squeezes his eyes shut, and looks again; the planes start
	bombing the distant hangers.

	Red pisses along the wall as he races to the barracks, trying
	to get his pecker back into his drawers.  He shouts to the
	sleeping guys --

					RED
			Th-th-th-th-th-

	He slaps his face with both hands, and stomps his feet...

					RED
			Th-th-th-th-Dammit!  Th-th-th-

	He still can't get it out, can't wake them; bursting with
	frustration, he suddenly blasts out singing --

					RED
				(singing)
			The Jaaaps!!  The Jaaaps!!

	He's belting it like a baritone in a bizarre opera.  His
	friends stir; what the hell?  Red points outside and tries to
	talk, but now he can't mutter a syllable.  The guys hear the
	explosions, and realize...

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY

	The pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed.  Seeing
	what's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the
	clustered American planes are blowing up in groups, and the
	pilots are knocked to the ground.

					BILLY
			Goddamn Japs!

	Billy jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of
	fighters that hasn't gone up yet.

					ANTHONY
			Billy!

	Anthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he
	misses; Billy gets a few steps before the fire from a
	strafing Zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror
	as Billy gets shorter as he runs; the Zero's machine gun fire
	is sawing his legs off from the feet up.

	Billy falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls
	almost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots.

	Their innocence, like America's, is gone in that moment.

	EXT.  ROAD TO MAIN AIRFIELD - DAY

	Danny and Rafe are in Danny's Buick, hung over and asleep,
	Danny in front, Rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight
	-- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one
	side of Rafe's nose and the corner of Danny's mouth.

	The rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the
	rumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation
	makes the sunlight flicker.  Danny and Rafe squint up, their
	heads pounding, and realize what they're seeing.  Suddenly
	their headaches are gone, and Danny's gunning the Buick down
	the road, toward the base.

	EXT.  AIR BASE - DAY

	Danny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy
	taking cover and haven't even closed the barrier.

	He races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still
	undamaged.  Rafe is out the door before the car stops
	rolling, and Danny's right behind him.

	They're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up
	with a bomb blast.  Rafe and Danny dive at each other; their
	first instinct is to cover their best friend with their own
	bodies.

	They look at each other on the ground.  They see machine gun
	bullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and
	ripping along the walls of the buildings.  It's as if the
	whole Japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not
	leaving a single plane airworthy.

					RAFE
			Get me into a plane!

					DANNY
			Come on!

	Danny sprints; Rafe follows.  Danny reaches a phone booth,
	and digs a dime from his pants.

					RAFE
			You're making a phone call?!

	Danny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more
	planes blow up on the flight line.  Rafe thinks he's lost his
	mind.

					DANNY
				(into phone)
			This is Walker!  We're under attack!  Get
			those planes fueled and armed RIGHT NOW!

	He runs back toward the car; Rafe, in the nonsense of battle,
	reaches in to hang up the receiver, before Danny grabs him
	and leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth
	shatters behind them from the strafing.

	On the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid
	strafing -- and see their friends lying nearby, in shock.

					ANTHONY
			They got Billy.

					DANNY
			Come with us!

	He and Rafe jump up and run again.  Anthony, Red, and several
	other pilots reach the Buick and dive in.  Danny drives away,
	through the strafing.

					RAFE
			Where are we going?

					DANNY
			Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles
			north of here.

					RAFE
			What's there?

					DANNY
			Six P-40's.

	As the Zero pilots see the Buick moving, they go after it.
	Danny drives like a madman through the strafing, zigzagging
	and gunning the Buick's V-8.

	EXT.  THE OKLAHOMA - STILL AT ANCHOR - DAY

	The number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their
	strategy flawless.  Torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull
	with a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush
	under and hit the next ship anchored behind.  The American
	battleships are bobbing like see-saws.

	The OKLAHOMA takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing
	thirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately
	begins to list.

	INT.  THE OKLAHOMA - DAY

	Doors are wedged shut by the deformation of the structure;
	vertical ladders are becoming horizontal, and water is
	pouring in.  Men fight their way up against the water.

	INT.  INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE OKLAHOMA - DAY

	Water is up to the trapped sailor's waists when they grab a
	wrench and start taking turns pounding S.O.S. in Morse code
	on the bulkhead.

	EXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY

	As the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from
	the deck into the water.  Still the Marines on deck are
	firing back at the planes; some Marines are even using
	handguns.  But courage does not save them...

	THE OKLAHOMA ROLLS OVER

	The men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the
	fires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400
	pound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and
	tumble through everything like massive wrecking balls.

	The sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to
	get away from the suction as the giant battleship turns
	turtle.

	BELOW THE WATER men are sucked down with amazing force, every
	hair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched
	to the depths.

	INSIDE THE OKLAHOMA, everyone and everything is spilling
	upside down.  The ship's generators sputter out and the
	lights go out.  The flashlights of the few sailors who can
	find them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills
	in.  There is no escape.

	BELOW THE WATER, the Oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom;
	some men are crushed there.  For others it's salvation, as
	the BACKWASH blows them toward the surface.

	ON THE SURFACE the men are launched almost completely out of
	the water, before splashing back into the water and burning
	oil.  A few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the
	propeller protrude above the surface, but most of the
	Oklahoma is under water.

	Men in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying
	wounded away from the wreckage.  A bomb hits the launch and
	blows body parts everywhere.

	INT.  OKLAHOMA - REAR COMPARTMENT

	In one compartment there are a dozen trapped men.  They've
	survived the roll-over, and are in a chaotic world where the
	floor is now the ceiling.  The water is up their waists.
	Some of the SAILORS are panicking.

	One sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the
	light from face to face.

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			Don't panic!  Don't panic!

					PANICKED SAILOR
			The water's rising!  It's coming up,
			we're all gonna drown!

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			The air pressure will equalize it!

	But the water keeps rising, along with their fears.  Several
	of the sailors are still screaming...

	The water's already to their bellies.  One of them grabs a
	wrench and starts slamming Morse code against the bulkhead.

	One sailor in the middle of the room is particularly
	panicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering --

					TERRIFIED SAILOR
			Get me out!  Get me out!

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			Stop it!  Come on!  Save your air!

					TERRIFIED SAILOR
			MY FOOT'S CAUGHT!

	He's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is
	deeper -- the ship's nose is lower than her stern.  The
	water's up to the guy's neck.

	The man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys
	foot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling -- now
	their floor.

	He pops up again.  The water's up to the trapped guy's mouth;
	he's already gagging.

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			Is there a hacksaw in that locker?!

	They open it; tools spill out -- among them is a hacksaw.
	They hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the
	guy's foot.

	The trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream.  He comes
	free, and surfaces gasping.  His severed foot floats to the
	surface and then the horror really hits them.  The sailor
	with the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood.  He
	and another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop
	the bleeding.

	The drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop
	their signaling.  Now they start banging, twice as loudly as
	before.

	EXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY

	Haleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic
	hills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is
	a quonset hut.  A mechanic named EARL, is out with the
	P-40's; and these are spread out, not bunched.

	EARL AND THE P-40'S

	The planes here have received loving care from Earl -- which
	means lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo
	belt, he yells.

					EARL
			Sum-bitch!

	The Buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to
	a stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out.

					DANNY
			They ready, Earl?

					EARL
			They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

	What stops him is the cloud of Zeros and dive bombers,
	shrieking in.

					DANNY
			Cover!

	The guys scatter.  There are sandbags around the hut, and
	they run there, diving into it's shelter just before the
	first strafing pass, when a Zero strafes one of the P-40's
	and a dive bomber blasts another.  Earl stands up in shock
	and fury.

					EARL
			You absolute mother-fuckin' son of a
			bitch!  You shot one of my planes!

	Danny pulls him down, as the Zeros roar overhead.

					DANNY
			This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's
			World War Two!

					RAFE
			They're coming around for another pass.
			You got extra weapons and ammo?

					EARL
			Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun
			lockers!

					DANNY
			You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come
			with me!

	Danny, Rafe and Earl run to the planes that got hit and strip
	out the 20mm cannons and ammo.

	INT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY

	The other pilots run in, throw open the gun locker, and start
	grabbing weapons -- aircraft machine guns, ammo belts, one
	even grabs a rifle.

	SANDBAGS BY THE SHED

	The two groups run back and start to set up.

					RAFE
			Danny, over there!  We're in a canyon,
			they'll come straight down it, we'll get
			'em in a crossfire.

	Danny, Rafe and Earl run to a gully opposite the shed and set
	up there, as the other pilots brace the machine guns against
	the sandbags.

	The Japanese planes attacks again.  This time the lead plane
	hits a wall of steel fired from the combined guns; the
	bullets chew into the bomb it carries and the plane EXPLODES.
	The airborne debris makes the following planes shear off.

	Red's standing, firing; he yells at the Zeros --

					RED
			D-don't like it when we fight back, do
			ya!

	Red runs out with his machine gun and keeps firing even when
	the planes have passed, trying to shoot them right up the
	ass.

					DANNY
			Earl!  You said the planes were ready
			but -- but what?

					EARL
			Of the four left, only one is full of
			fuel.

					RAFE
			Will the others get into the air?

	Earl shoots a look to Rafe, then turns to Danny.

					EARL
			Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.

					DANNY
			Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma,
			you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come
			with us!  Earl, you get on the radio!
			We're gonna fight these fuckers.

	Two of the pilots, Joe and Theo, run to Danny.

					JOE
			How do we do it?

					DANNY
			Your call, Rafe.

					RAFE
			Get rolling as fast as you can.  Stay
			low!  We'll use the topography to
			separate them and then we can take 'em
			one on one.

	They race toward the planes, and the Japanese attack again.
	Seeing the pilots running for the P-40's, the Zeros aim for
	them; Rafe and Danny race for the most distant of the planes;
	Joe and Theo run for the closer planes, through the dusty
	bullet hits.

	Theo makes his plane and is just strapping himself in when
	bullets stitch his fuselage, wounding him.  He still forces
	the plane forward.  He taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets
	chopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters
	to a stop, Theo dead at the controls.

	Joe doesn't bother to strap in; he hits the throttle hard and
	heads down the runway...

	The Zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120 M.P.H.
	The Zero's bullets eat his canopy and plane skin; the plane
	breaks apart in mid air, spilling in gouts of flame as it
	smashes down on the tarmac.

	Rafe and Danny have reaches the more distant P-40's and are
	revving their engines as they see Joe and Theo's fate.  They
	throw on their radio headsets.

	Their way seems blocked:  they've got no runway behind them,
	the wreckage of four P-40's scattered ahead of them, and the
	Zeros screaming over the low hills to attack them.  Now Rafe
	and Danny talk through the radio.

					DANNY
			It's tight.

					RAFE
			Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season.
			Don't hit the barn.

	They gun their engines and roll through the grass on either
	side of the runway, dodging the burning planes; they lift
	off, clearing the quonset hut by a couple of inches.  They
	blow right through the strafing fire, and into the sky.

	Eight Zeros are all over them.

	Earl is in the hut, on the radio and watching through
	binoculars.

					EARL
			I see six...seven...eight of the
			cocksuckers!  Don't let 'em hurt my
			planes.

	Danny's swiveling in his seat, looking left, right, back.

					DANNY
			They're all over us!

					RAFE
			Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.

	Danny understands immediately, following Rafe's tactic as he
	breaks into a sharp turn and uses the hut, palm trees, and
	low hills to shake the Japs.  They fly like crop dusters,
	skimming down a foot from the ground, then bobbing up,
	banking left and right.  The Zeros have divided into two
	groups to chase them, their wings clipping tree tops as they
	try to follow the Americans.

	It feels like a 200 M.P.H. car chase, 20 feet off the ground,
	Rafe and Danny skimming and bobbing over the terrain, but
	there are too many Japanese.

					RAFE
			Danny!  Let's play some chicken!

	Danny banks in one direction, Rafe in another...

	EXT.  OVER THE LANDING STRIP - DAY

	The two P-40's are screaming, rushing at each other like they
	did at the training base back in the states, flying right
	into each other's propellers; the Japanese heading after them
	realize they're rushing headlong at the other group...

					EARL
			Oh shit, oh shit...

	He can't even watch.

	At the last instant Rafe and Danny snap a quarter spin so the
	planes flash by belly to belly.

	Two of the Zeros collide in mid-air, exploding, as the other
	Zeros scatter.

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Danny and Rafe rejoin each other in the open sky; they've
	lost the Zeros.  The P-40's are flying smoothly, side by
	side.  The two pilots look across at each other, going into
	battle together.  They speak through their radios.

					RAFE
			You hear my okay?

					DANNY
			Yeah.  So you can call me if you need
			help.

					RAFE
			I got a half a tank.  You?

					DANNY
			Little less.

	He fires a short burst to see if his guns work; they do.
	Rafe does the same.  Up ahead they see a formation of
	Japanese planes, headed toward Pearl.

					RAFE
			They're in strafing formation, we'll blow
			right through their line.

	They look across at each other.

					RAFE
			Land of the free.

					DANNY
			Home of the brave.

	Side by side the P-40's scream in.

	EXT.  ABOVE OAHU - THE DOGFIGHT - DAY

	The Japanese planes are in tight, disciplined formation,
	their minds on the targets below them in the harbor.  But
	their day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two P-40's
	blast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into Two Zeros.  Both
	Zeros falter and begin to lose altitude.  The P-40's make
	almost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go
	after the two plane they crippled on the first pass.

	Rafe finishes one Zero, making it explode in a ball of flame
	in the air.  Danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing
	so that it spirals into the sea and crashes there.

	The P-40's swoop up again.

					RAFE
			They're trying to hold formation.  We can
			chew 'em up!

	The P-40's dig in again, swooping down on the line of Zeros.
	Rafe hits first, machine gunning one plane, and Danny comes
	in behind it, finishing it off.

	The Japanese pilots are screaming at each other over their
	radios, but their SQUADRON COMMANDER sees Pearl Harbor ahead,
	and tells them --

					JAPANESE SQUADRON COMMANDER
			Hold the line!

	The P-40's come through again, their guns spitting fire.

	EXT.  ANOTHER JAPANESE FORMATION OF BOMBERS - DAY

	These planes are different -- high altitude bombers with
	three-man crews, high above the harbor.  The bombardier looks
	through his sight and the bomb bays open.

	THROUGH THE BOMBARDIER'S SIGHT, the ships look like tops, far
	below.  The bombardier is ticking off the targets as they
	pass, the first two he mentions already burning.

					JAPANESE BOMBARDIER
			West Virginia... Oklahoma... Ah, Arizona.

	He flips his bomb switch, and a HUGE STEEL BOMB falls away.

	EXT.  THE FLIGHT OF THE BOMB - DAY

	We stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky.  The small
	propeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the
	arming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core.  The bomb
	wobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins
	stabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying
	rate, toward the Arizona.

	It slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like
	matchsticks.

	It's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next
	deck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship...toward
	the powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are
	waiting.

	The bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond
	comprehension.  Over 1400 men die instantly.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The battleship Arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine
	is broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant.
	Men on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already
	floating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but
	there are almost no survivors.

	The concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship
	Vestal, next to the Arizona, saving Vestal, as the explosion
	snuffs out the fires on Vestal; it also sends tons of debris
	down on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads
	of men, all sorts of bodies.

	Debris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does
	more damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Medics have already started bringing in the wounded.  Evelyn
	is like a frantic traffic cop.

					EVELYN
			Put criticals in ward one, stables in
			two!  Barbara!  Fill every syringe you
			can find with stimulant and antibiotic --

					MEDIC
			Where are the doctors?

					EVELYN
			On the third tee.

					SANDRA
			Evelyn!  Where's the morphine?

	THE FRONT WARD

	Evelyn runs in, snaps open the cabinet, grabs a bag of
	morphine sticks, and is about to run out again when she sees
	the Arizona go up.

	For a moment she's frozen, then she actually sees the shock
	wave traveling across the bay and through the trees like an
	invisible wall.  She's trying to cross her arms over her
	face, and dive to the floor, just as the windows blow out
	from the concussion, and glass flies over everything.

	INT.  JAPANESE BOMBER - DAY

	They see the results of their bomb, and are ecstatic.

	EXT.  AIR ABOVE OAHU - DAY

	The nose of Danny's plane is pointed right at the harbor and
	he sees the sudden devastation of the Arizona.  It is a sight
	so awesome it freezes him for a moment.

	A Zero comes up behind him, firing.  Danny jerks his stick to
	maneuver but he's caught...

	Rafe comes in behind the Zero, chopping it up, even as he
	yells at Danny over the radio --

					RAFE
			Ain't no time for spectatin'!

	They turn back after the line of Zeros.  There are some
	Japanese planes coming after them now, but the P-40's head at
	their noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and
	turn right back into the Japanese formation.

	Rafe has a plane in his sights, but his guns fire only a
	short burst before stopping.

					RAFE
			I'm out of ammo!

					DANNY
			I'm out of fuel!

	They head back.  A single Zero is on their way.  Rafe charges
	it and draws its fire; Danny comes in behind the Zero and
	rakes its cockpit; the Japanese pilot backs off.

	The P-40's dive back toward Haleiwa.

	A handful of Zeros returning from Pearl see them and follow.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - JAPANESE CARRIERS - DAY

	The second wave of planes takes off from the carriers.

	INT.  FLIGHT CONTROL CENTER - CARRIER AKAGI - DAY

	Genda reports to Yamamoto.

					GENDA
			Second attack wave is in the air.

	INT.  RADIO STATION KGBM - DAY

	The DISC JOCKEY, handed a message by the army officer, stops
	playing the soothing Hawaiian music and announces...

					DISC JOCKEY
			All Army, Navy, and Marine personnel to
			report to duty.

	INT.  GENERAL SHORT'S OFFICE - DAY

	General SHORT is in his office; he and his aides are working
	frantically.

					GENERAL SHORT
			Mobilize everything!  We're at war!  Send
			a message to Washington:  Hostilities
			with Japan commenced with an air raid on
			Pearl Harbor.

	INT.  WHITE HOUSE - OVAL ROOM - DAY

	President Roosevelt is having lunch in the Oval Room study
	with Harry Hopkins.  The phone RINGS and Hopkins answers.

					HOPKINS
			Oval Room... Yes, he is.
				(to Roosevelt)
			It's Knox, Mr. President.

					ROOSEVELT
				(taking phone)
			Yes?

	He listens, then puts the receiver down, shaken.

					ROOSEVELT
			The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor.

					HOPKINS
			My God.  Do we have damage estimates?

					ROOSEVELT
			Our Pacific Fleet, at anchor, unprepared?
			It's terrible.  It has to be.  And it's
			not over.

	EXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY

	The two P-40's drop out of the sky and bounce to a landing;
	Anthony and Red have been pushing the wreckage off the field
	with the Buick.  Danny and Rafe pull the P-40's behind the
	burning quonset hut, and it's like a pit stop at a race
	track; Earl rushes up and starts fueling the planes, their
	engines still running.

					DANNY
			We need ammo too!

	Earl shouts instructions to the pilots.

					EARL
			Strip it from the wrecks!

	The other pilots race to the wrecked P-40's and start pulling
	out ammo belts.  Earl glares at the smoking engine of Danny's
	plane, and the bullet holes.

					EARL
			Who the fuck taught you to fly?

					DANNY
			He did.

	Earl looks at Rafe's plane, more shot-up and abused than
	Danny's.  Rafe grins and waves to him.  Earl mumbles a stream
	of guttural and unintelligible obscenities.

	The Zeros that followed them sweep down, strafing.  One
	mechanic, running across the field with a belt of ammo, goes
	down.  Coma, running behind him, picks up the fallen man's
	ammo and his own, bringing both to the planes behind the hut.
	He, Red, and Anthony reload the machine guns in Rafe and
	Danny's planes.

	Rafe and Danny gun their engines and head back into the air,
	the grounded pilots firing a covering barrage and Earl even
	coming up with a 12-gauge shotgun to fire at the Zeros as
	they rush past.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - DAY

	The Second Wave of Japanese planes is in tight formation.

	INT.  LEAD PLANE OF SECOND WAVE - DAY

	Lt. Commander SHIMAZAKI, leader of the second attack wave,
	says calmly into his radio...

					SHIMAZAKI
			Second wave, deploy over the military
			bases.  High level bombers to the air
			stations, dive bombers attack ships in
			harbor.  Fighters strafe and cover.

	He leads the second wave in on their attack run...

	EXT.  NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

	The navy's planes, bunched up on the naval airfield, are
	destroyed without ever getting into the air.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The harbor is already a mass of destruction and panic;
	screaming everywhere, men trying to fight fires, move the
	wounded; the second wave of planes hits, and tremendous
	explosions now rock the secondary ships like the destroyer
	SHAW, blasting it apart.

	But the Japanese pilots are now having trouble with the thick
	black smoke coming out of the damaged ships, and off the oil
	fires along the water.  One torpedo plane, its pilot flying
	blind, clips the superstructure of a battleship and spins to
	a crash.

	Still, even IN THE CHAOS ON THE SHIPS, the sailors struggle
	to survive, inventively.  Men trapped on one burning ship use
	the severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to
	cross to the less damaged ship anchored beside them.

	Others jump into the water and swim through the burning oil,
	towing buddies too wounded to swim themselves.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Below decks, sailors have organized a line and are passing
	ammunition from the ammo lockers, hand to hand up to the guns
	on deck.  Blasts from bombs hit them and ignite the ammo
	they're holding, setting off a chain reaction of explosions.

	On the deck, the sailors are out of ammo.  An OFFICER grabs a
	SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SAILOR.

					OFFICER
			Grab a dinghy and get ammo from the base
			ammo storeroom.

	The young sailor jumps to a dinghy and launches it through
	the oily waters and thick black smoke.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The sailors in the boat get strafed, the rounds cutting
	between them and blasting their boat in two.  They jump into
	the oily water and swim toward shore.

	Other sailors are in the water with them, struggling,
	swallowing the vile black liquid as they battle to swim.
	Errant bombs and shrapnel hit beside them, killing some;
	other lose strength and slide beneath the surface.

	The sailors from the ammo boat make it ashore; it's hot there
	too, with bullets and bombs all around.  One sailor has to
	stop and puke from the oil; his buddy grabs him and they run
	for cover; they find it in the dugout of the baseball
	diamond.

	EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

	A MARINE GUNNERY SERGEANT leads men in a race through
	strafing fire to the bases ammo storeroom.

	INT.  AMMO STOREROOM - DAY

	The SUPPLY SERGEANT is at his post.

					GUNNERY SERGEANT
			We need weapons and ammo!

					SUPPLY SERGEANT
			You need authorization.

					GUNNERY SERGEANT
			The fuck I do!

	He pushes the man out of the way and starts grabbing weapons.

	EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

	The gunnery sergeant and his marines run with a water-cooled
	machine gun, across the open ground, under fire.

	BARRACKS

	The Marines set up in the windows of their already-strafed
	barracks, and start firing there, as the Zeros scream past.

	EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

	Trucks are moving dependents -- women and children -- from
	the dependents' housing area.  The Japanese strafe the
	trucks, dependents diving for cover.

	NAVAL STATION

	A fire engine from the Honolulu Fire Department races up to
	the sight of buildings burning from the air attack.  As the
	firemen jump out, a Zero strafes them, gunning down the
	firemen.

	As the strafing Zero starts to bank away, two P-40's come in
	behind it, both of them gunning away.  The Zero comes apart
	under the barrage, and crashes in a ball of flame.

	It's Rafe and Danny, back in the air.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	The once-pristine hospital with its glowing white beds is now
	a bloody chaos.  Every bed is already full; there are burned
	and broken people on the floor -- soldiers, sailors,
	civilians, firemen, all mixed in together.  People are dying
	everywhere, and screaming in pain, or moaning and begging for
	help.  At first we don't see Evelyn, and wonder if she
	survived the glass; then we see her, flecks of her own blood
	dotting her face and arms.  The blood of soldiers on her
	surgical apron.  A steel calm has replaced her earlier
	frenzy, even as the other nurses are breaking down.

					SANDRA
			I can't tell who's gotten morphine and
			who hasn't!

					EVELYN
			Take a grease pencil and mark an M on the
			forehead of everyone you stick.

	A young doctor is trying to give an intravenous injection to
	a man who's badly charred; the doctors hands are shaking.

					EVELYN
			Don't look for a vein, just poke.

					SANDRA
			My pen's dry!

					EVELYN
			Use lipstick.  Use ammo belts for
			tourniquets, use your own nylons if you
			have to!  Barbara!  Grab anything that
			will hold a pint of blood and sterilize
			it.

	The doctors are amputating limbs right there in the hallway.
	A SENIOR DOCTOR calls --

					SENIOR DOCTOR
			Evelyn!  You have to do the triage!
			They're bringing them in with trucks!

	Evelyn moves to the door.  Trucks are pulling up, loaded with
	the wounded, young terrified soldiers bringing them inside;
	Evelyn does quick triage as they pass.

					EVELYN
			Critical -- front ward!... Give him
			morphine, he can't wait...

	The next body through is a pilot, wings on his uniform, his
	chest riddled with bullets -- and his face shot off.  For a
	moment Evelyn falters, then she forces herself to check the
	dog tags...

	It isn't Rafe or Danny.  Evelyn sags in guilty relief.

					EVELYN
			Take him outside and cover him; he's
			dead.

	She steadies herself as the next body comes through, a woman
	on a stretcher, her stomach shot open, pale hands clutching
	at the open wound.  Evelyn feels for a pulse.

					EVELYN
			She's gone too, take her --

	It's Betty.

	And though the bombs are blasting and guns booming
	everywhere, the world goes silent for Evelyn.

	One of the sailors outside the door is pointing to the
	harbor, the Nevada has begun to move.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The battleship NEVADA is underway, plowing through the
	harbor, as the water erupts with bombs.

	INT.  THE NEVADA'S BRIDGE - DAY

	The Captain is struggling to save his ship.

					CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA
			We can save her if we make the open sea!

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - POV THE ATTACKING PLANES - DAY

	The lead pilot in the next squad of Japanese planes spots the
	moving battleship, and leads his squadron on it.

	They come whipping in over the waves, dropping torpedoes and
	bombs.

	INT.  THE NEVADA'S BRIDGE - DAY

	The Nevada's Captain feels the ship shudder as it takes hits
	amidships.

					CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA
			We're not gonna make it -- and if we go
			down here we block the channel... Beach
			her, there!

	His officers relay the order to the helm, and the ship's
	rudder turns as more blasts rip her hull.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The Nevada swings off its course and runs aground.

	INT.  THE NEVADA'S DYNAMO ROOM - DAY

	The impact jolts the boilers, already bursting with the steam
	pressure; gouts of steam from rupturing pipes scalds and
	blinds the engine room crew.

	EXT.  THE NEVADA - DAY

	The Nevada, run aground at the shoreline, is now like a beast
	cut from the herd; the predators swarm after it with
	torpedoes and bombs.

	One torpedo, missing the Nevada, skims right up the beach
	itself and blasts a house on the shore to fragments.

	Bombs detonate along the Nevada, engulfing the entire upper
	deck in flames, ravaging the sailors.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

	The Nevada is grounded near the hospital; from the doorway
	Evelyn can see the whole ship on fire, burning sailors
	leaping off the decks.  Her hearing, her presence of mind,
	returns; she lets Betty go, and grabs an ORDERLY.

					EVELYN
			Go to the base hardware store and get
			some of those canister spray things they
			use for killing bugs.

					ORDERLY
			Insecticide?...

					EVELYN
			No, just the sprayers.  We'll fill them
			with tannic acid, it'll sterilize them
			and cool the burns!  GO!

	The orderly races away.  They can still hear the bombs
	falling outside.

	A sailor staggers toward the hospital from the Nevada.  He is
	completely gray.  Everyone stares at him, and then realizes
	he is nude, burned gray, his skin ash.

	Evelyn rushes to help him, shouting back over her shoulder to
	the other nurses --

					EVELYN
			We're gonna need every bed.  If they can
			breathe, make 'em get up and move
			someplace else!

	EXT.  JAPANESE CARRIER - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

	The first wave of planes lands on the carrier.  The flight
	leader rushes to the bridge.

	INT.  JAPANESE CARRIER - BRIDGE - DAY

	Yamamoto's advisors are exultant.

					GENDA
			We have achieved complete surprise!  The
			first wave is returning, the second is
			attacking now, and we have lost only a
			few planes.  We can launch a third wave,
			Admiral.

					YAMAMOTO
			The second wave has not returned.  And we
			have no idea where their carriers are.
			What is the damage report?

					COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
			We have Commander Fuchida on the radio
			now, Admiral.

	Yamamoto nods and Fuchida's voice comes over the intercom.

					FUCHIDA'S VOICE
			I am over the harbor now...

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Fuchida is in a scout plane, high over Pearl.  His vision is
	hampered by the thick black smoke, but he can tell there has
	been awesome devastation.  He uses a diagram of the ships at
	anchor to note the damage to each ship.

					FUCHIDA
				(into radio)
			We have a tremendous victory.  Many ships
			damaged, some totally destroyed.  But the
			Second Wave's attack is being hindered by
			the smoke.

	INT.  WAR ROOM OF THE AKAGI - DAY

					YAMAMOTO
			The more we attack, the harder it is to
			find targets.  And we no longer have
			surprise.

					GENDA
			If we launch the third wave and
			annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy
			their ability to operate in the Pacific
			for at least a year!

					YAMAMOTO
			And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we
			destroy our ability to fight them at all.
				(beat)
			As soon as the second wave returns, we
			will withdraw.

	EXT.  JAPANESE CARRIER AKAGI - DAY

	The last planes touch down, and the lead carrier and the
	other ships in the Japanese assault fleet turn back toward
	home.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - DAY

	The harbor is a place of shattered bodies and shattered
	ships.  Blood, body parts, debris everywhere, and all of it
	made more hellish by the oil fires on the water and the
	choking black smoke those fires produce.

	Every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher
	bearer, medic, iron worker.  They fish men from the water,
	extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships.
	Everyone is screaming and yelling -- the wounded for help,
	the helpers for more help.

	Local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the water
	mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base
	swimming pool toward the burning ships.

	The PHOTOGRAPHER records this with his black-and-white film
	camera.  He is shaken, and yet he understands the magnitude
	of what he is recording -- the loss of America's innocence.

	EXT.  ARMY BASE - AFTERMATH - DAY

	In one place, outside a barracks, soldiers hit by the bombs
	are just becoming conscious.  One of them comes to.

					CONSCIOUS SOLDIER
			Sarge?!  Where are you, Sarge?

	He's crawling around toward the bushes; his legs are
	shattered, but he's spotted a body.  He reaches it, turns it
	over -- and it's headless.

	He turns away in horror...and finds himself staring at the
	severed head.

	The medics appear.

					MEDIC
			We've got two more over here!

	EXT.  GENERAL SHORT'S OFFICE - DAY

	The Western Union messenger, Tadao Fuchikami, delivers the
	telegram from Washington.

	INT.  GENERAL SHORT'S OFFICE - DAY

	Short and his staff are assessing damage.

					SHORT
			I want lookouts and sentries everywhere,
			with orders to shoot first and ask
			questions later.

					COLONEL
			You think an invasion possible, General?

					SHORT
			After this morning, we better not
			consider anything impossible.

	An aide hands Short the telegram.  He reads it --

					SHORT
			From Washington.  "Intelligence reports
			an ultimatum from Japan to be given
			precisely at one p.m.  Washington time.
			Just what significance the hour set may
			have we do not know, but be on alert
			accordingly."

	The irony is bitter in his throat.

	EXT.  JAPANESE EMBASSY - OAHU - DAY

	The Honolulu police roar up to the embassy in squad cars, and
	burst through the doors.

	INT.  JAPANESE EMBASSY - OAHU - DAY

	The police storm through the embassy and find the Japanese
	there burning documents.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - DAY

	Divers are going down, trying to save the trapped men.  But
	the tangle of the Arizona is horrific.  One diver gets
	trapped, and another tries to extricate him, and the steel
	shifts and falls on them both.

	ON THE DECK OF BOMB-SHATTERED BATTLESHIP, a naval CAPTAIN
	oversees rescue efforts.  The 17-year-old sailor he sent off
	for ammo now approaches him, with great concern.

					SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD SAILOR
			Sir, I...I lost the dinghy.

	The captain looks out over the wreckage, great battleships
	devastated in every direction.

					CAPTAIN
			Well, son, we won't worry about the
			dinghy today.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Danny and Rafe arrive at the hospital.  Their fears of what
	they might find aren't helped when they see the stairs into
	the hospital covered in blood.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny enter.  It's a scene from hell.  Doctors are
	doing amputations in the hallway.  The once-pristine hospital
	is now all red, with blood dripping through the mattresses,
	onto the floor...

	In the main ward, Evelyn and the other nurses are using the
	fly sprayers to spritz cooling antiseptic on the charred
	bodies.  Evelyn looks up and sees both Rafe and Danny.  Her
	eyes register relief, but they are the only part of her that
	can show emotion now; the rest of her is covered in blood.
	Rafe and Danny move to her.

					RAFE
			How can we help?

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny sit quietly as Evelyn adjusts the tubes
	conducting blood from their arms into sterilized Coke bottles
	for transfusion.

					RAFE
			What else can we do?

					EVELYN
			There's nothing you can do here, they'll
			die or they won't, we just --

	She stops, afraid if she says more, she'll lose grip on her
	emotions.  She can see the wreckage out in the harbor.

					EVELYN
			There was a sailor, a black man on the
			West Virginia, named Dorie Miller.  I'd
			like to know if he's alive.

	She goes back to her work.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Rafe and Danny hop from the ambulance in which they've
	hitched a ride to the harbor.  They see the awful
	devastation.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny reach the West Virginia's pier, but in the
	darkness, they can't find anything.  They stop a NAVAL
	OFFICER.

					DANNY
			Where is the West Virginia?

					OFFICER
			There.

	He points; the battleship has sunk, its superstructure barely
	showing above the water.

	It looks hopeless to find a single sailor here; but then they
	see a powerful black sailor, pulling to the dock with a
	dinghy full of dead men retrieved from the water.  As workers
	unload the bodies, the black sailor sits down, exhausted
	physically and emotionally, his head in his hands.  Rafe and
	Danny approach him.

					DANNY
			We're looking for Dorie Miller.

					DORIE
			That's me, Sir.

					RAFE
			A friend of ours wanted to be sure you're
			alive.  Evelyn.  A nurse.

					DORIE
			How is she?

					DANNY
			Like we all are.

	Miller nods, and looks out over the harbor, a hellish place
	where black smoke still hangs over everything, the shattered
	remains of men and ships still in the harbor.  It's total
	devastation.  And yet something about that scene stirs
	something else in Dorie Miller.

					DORIE
			There's something out there I need to
			get.  Will you help me?

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - NIGHT

	Dorie pilots the dinghy through the floating debris.  Rafe
	and Danny sit with him.  He stops over a dangerous pile of
	superstructure wreckage.

					DORIE
			The Arizona.  Hold the dinghy steady, so
			it doesn't bust open.

	Rafe and Danny brace the dinghy so it doesn't move; but they
	still don't see what Dorie is after as he fishes down in the
	water, for something barely at the surface; he works for a
	moment, then pulls it up.

	It's the oil-soaked flag of the Arizona.

	EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

	Men are working through the night to save the sailors trapped
	in the hull.

	INT.  OKLAHOMA - THE TRAPPED SAILORS

	are in total darkness.  From it we hear GASPING, then --

					SAILOR
			What's that?

	The light comes on and sweeps around the faces.  The water is
	up to their chests, but it's stopped rising.

					SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
			Just hand on.  They'll find us.

					SAILOR
			How do you know?

					SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
			Because we would find them.

	He switches the light off again.

	EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

	The welders are cutting away, the torches sending showers of
	sparks everywhere.

	INT.  OKLAHOMA - THE TRAPPED SAILORS

	They are gasping, running out of air.

					SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
			Breathe easy.  Stay calm.

					SAILOR
			You hear something?

	Something stirs in the ship; a noise...from where?  Then a
	point of light; sparks fly into the room; somebody's cutting
	through the wall.  And the sparks illuminate faces suddenly
	filled with hope.

	But as the cut enlarges, the trapped air, compressed by the
	water, starts rushing out -- and the water starts rising
	again.  The trapped sailors hope turns to terror.

					SAILOR
			It's letting out air, and letting in
			water!

	The steel circle pops out, and they knock the welders down in
	their hurry to escape.

	Some of the sailors who were trapped are naked.  They fight
	their way toward the escape hole cut into the hull, assisted
	by rescue workers.

	EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

	The trapped sailors emerge, and they can barely take in the
	devastation.  Destroyed ships everywhere, the smoking
	wreckage... The rescued sailors gaze around them in shock.
	They are shivering, and other sailors put blankets around
	them.

	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	The entire Washington press corps is waiting, with fresh
	bulbs in the flash attachments of cameras that are already as
	big as a shoe box.  The President is wheeled out of the White
	House, and not a single photographer takes a picture...not
	yet.

	Aides help Roosevelt from the chair, and the press people all
	see the President struggle on legs that have no strength, to
	the podium.  His aides lock the steel clasps at the knees of
	his braces into place, and the President stands at the
	microphone.  And suddenly, from the front, Roosevelt looks
	powerful, even majestic.

	Now all the bulbs pop and flash.  He looks into the cameras.

					ROOSEVELT
			Yesterday, December 7, 1941 -- a date

	OVER THIS, we see the bombing, the aftermath, the bodies
	being fished from the oil-soaked harbor.

					ROOSEVELT
			The distance of Hawaii from Japan makes
			it obvious that the attacks was planned
			many days or even weeks ago.  During the

			has deliberately sought to deceive the
			United States by false statements and

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

	The Japanese fleet steams back toward Japan.  The young

					ROOSEVELT
			...I regret to tell you that many

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	We see rows of bodies outside the hospital where Evelyn
	works.

	The mess hall has been converted to a silent morgue, with
	bodies on every table.

					ROOSEVELT
			Yesterday the Japanese Government also
			launched an attack against Malaya.  Last

	OVER THIS, EXT.  ISLANDS - NIGHT

	We see Japanese planes bombing islands, and soldiers
	attacking amphibious landings.

	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

					ROOSEVELT
			The facts speak for themselves.  With

			triumph -- so help us God.  I ask that
			the Congress declare that since the

			on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of

	The words echoes out across America --

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			War...war...war...

	It rings through the radios of farm houses, to country boys
	gathered round; in the pool halls of big cities; in the fire
	houses and high schools...

	THE LINES AT RECRUITING STATIONS all across America -- men
	line up faster than the recruiters can handle them.

	INT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	Roosevelt meets with his advisors.

					ROOSEVELT
			Gentlemen, the crisis we face is not the
			fact that our enemies believe they can
			defeat us -- it's the fact that our people
			believe it too.  I want a plan -- a
			workable plan -- to hit the heart of
			Japan, to bomb them the way they have
			bombed us.

					ADMIRAL
			Mr. President, Pearl Harbor caught us
			because we didn't face facts.  This isn't
			a time for ignoring them again.  There
			are no planes in the entire American
			arsenal capable of covering the distance
			to Japan from any land base we control
			while carrying enough bombs to do any
			damage whatsoever.

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			He's right, Mr. President.  The Army has
			long range bombers, but no place to
			launch them from.  Midway's too far,
			China is overrun by Japanese forces, and
			Russia refuses to go to war with Japan
			and won't allow us to launch a raid from
			there.

					ADMIRAL
			The navy's planes are small, carry light
			loads, and have short range.  We would
			have to get them within a few hundred
			miles of Japan, and therefore risk our
			carriers.  And if we lose our carriers,
			we have no shield against invasion.

					ROOSEVELT
			What if the Japanese did invade?

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			We've done studies.  We're confident we
			would turn them back eventually...after
			they'd gotten as far as Chicago.

					ADMIRAL
			Mr. President...with all respect...what
			you are asking can't be done.

	Roosevelt places his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and
	struggles to lift himself.  Aides jump to help him, but he
	waves them off.  With inhuman physical effort, that has his
	neck veins bulging and sweat popping on his face, Roosevelt
	stands on his withered legs.

					ROOSEVELT
			Do not tell me...it can't be done.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - HICKAM BASE - DAY

	There is a mass memorial service going on, with caskets
	draped in flags.

	There are also coffins covered in Japanese flags, their
	drowned fliers being treated now with respect.

	Everyone is in their best uniforms.  The pilots -- Rafe,
	Danny, and the other guys -- are looking at Billy's coffin;
	Evelyn, next to Danny, on his appropriate side is looking at
	one that belongs to Betty.  So is Red; he's grieving.

					MINISTER
			...Where is God in this?  Our enemies
			believe a divine wind protects them.  We
			see our friends laid out before us, and
			find it hard to believe in anything at
			all.

	Rafe and Evelyn exchange a glance, past Danny.

					MINISTER
			Though we cannot understand why our
			friends should die while we live, we can
			affirm our truest selves in our belief
			that any God worth divinity would choose
			both justice and mercy, and would take
			these fallen brothers and sisters into
			eternal peace.  Amen.

	As the mourners disperse, Evelyn puts a lei on Betty's
	casket; Red does the same, then breaks down beside Danny.  As
	Danny comforts him, Evelyn moves to Rafe.

					EVELYN
			Rafe --

					RAFE
			I need to tell you something.  I didn't
			know what it was to lose somebody, to see
			death and find how much it scares you.
			That you haven't lived and loved enough.
			I didn't understand.  Forgive me.

					EVELYN
			Rafe... No.  You forgive me.

					RAFE
			Of course I forgive you.  I know what you
			feel for Danny is real.  And your choice
			is your choice.

					EVELYN
			That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It
			wasn't a choice.  It --

	An Army Corps MAJOR steps up and interrupts.

					MAJOR
			Lieutenant Rafe McCawley?

					RAFE
			Yes, Major.

					MAJOR
			Lieutenant Daniel Walker here too?

	Danny sees him and moves up.

					DANNY
			I'm Walker.

					MAJOR
			You're going Stateside.  We fly out in
			half an hour.

	He hands them both orders.

					RAFE
			What for, Sir?

					MAJOR
			Ask Colonel Doolittle.  Those orders are
			from him.

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - DAY

	The wrecked planes have been pushed off the runway and lie in
	piles.  A transport plane is fueling, and Rafe and Danny wait
	in the shade of a shelter.

					DANNY
			I told her not to come.

	The Major, watching the fueling, gets a wave from the ground
	crew and turns and motions to Rafe and Danny that they're
	ready.  They pick up their duffel bags -- and then Evelyn
	comes around the corner of the shelter.

	Rafe sees her first, but stops and looks away as Danny moves
	to her.  For a moment he studies her eyes, and she does not
	look away.

					DANNY
			This hasn't been easy for any of us.  I
			feel awful for how it's happened.  But
			I've seen my first spring too.  Thanks
			for knowing that's true.

	He takes her into his arms, kisses her tenderly but briefly,
	a final time.  Evelyn's eyes find Rafe, but he can't look at
	her until the embrace is over.

	Rafe and Danny move to the plane and hurry up the steps.
	They turn before the door closes and wave to her.

	Evelyn's still standing there as the plane lifts away.

	INT.  U.S. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT

	The transport has landed and taxied right to the door of a
	low, dark bunker, mostly underground.  The Major leads Rafe
	and Danny inside.

	INT.  BUNKER

	Rafe and Danny follow the Major down a spartan corridor; the
	whole place reeks of secrecy.

	INT.  BUNKER - SECRECY ROOM - NIGHT

	The Major opens the door for Rafe and Danny, then leaves,
	closing it behind him.  Doolittle is alone at a desk.  Rafe
	and Danny walk in and salute.  Doolittle motions to the two
	chairs in front of the desk without looking up from the
	papers he's studying.

					DOOLITTLE
			I heard what you did.

					RAFE
			We can explain, Colonel.

					DOOLITTLE
			Explain what?

					DANNY
			Whatever is was you heard about us.

					DOOLITTLE
			You mean the hula shirts you were flying
			in?... Or the six planes you shot down?
			You're both being awarded the Silver
			Star, and promoted to captain.

					RAFE
			Is that the good new, Sir, or --

					DOOLITTLE
			You're just about the only pilots in the
			Army with actual combat experience, so
			you're volunteering for a mission I've
			been ordered to put together.  Do you
			know what top secret is?

					RAFE
			Well sure, Colonel --

					DOOLITTLE
			Top secret means you help me pick the
			other pilots, train, and go -- without
			knowing where you're going until it's too
			late.

					DANNY
			You can count on us.

					DOOLITTLE
			There's only one other thing I can tell
			you.

	Doolittle looks up from his paperwork for the first time.
	His eyes are fierce.

					DOOLITTLE
			You won't need any goddamn hula shirts.

	EXT.  ESTABLISHING EGLIN FIELD, FLORIDA - DAY

	Eglin Field is on the gulf coast of Florida.

	INT.  BRIEFING ROOM - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	A room full of PILOTS are assembled, with and other CREWMEN.
	Danny and Rafe are there; Red and Anthony too.

					VOICE
			Attention!

	Colonel Doolittle strides into the room as all the men snap
	to attention.

					DOOLITTLE
			Be seated.  The mission you've
			volunteered for is dangerous.  How
			dangerous?  Look at the man beside you.
			It's a good bet that six weeks from now,
			either you or he will be dead.

	Danny and Rafe whisper to each other --

					DANNY
			Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna
			make it.

					RAFE
			What color flowers you want me to bring
			to your funeral?

					DOOLITTLE
			In flight school you qualified in single
			and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be
			flying multi-engines here.

					RAFE
				(whispering)
			Bombers.

					DOOLITTLE
			I want to introduce a couple of people.
			Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has
			volunteered for gunnery training so that
			he can go on the mission, because we
			can't spare the weight of an extra man.

					DANNY
				(whispering)
			A long range bomber mission.

					DOOLITTLE
			...And Ross Greening, who will oversee
			your equipment.  Any questions?

					DANNY
			Who'll be the first one in, Colonel?  I'd
			like to volunt --

	Rafe elbows his ribs so hard it takes his breath away.

					DOOLITTLE
			I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not
			just putting this mission together -- I'm
			leading it myself.

					RAFE
			I take it back, about the flowers.  We're
			all gonna die.

	EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - RUNWAY - DAY

	CLOSE - A B-25 bomber, from different angles.

	The pilots look them over, liking what they see.

					DOOLITTLE
			This is what we'll fly -- the B-25.
			There's one thing you have to be aware of
			from the very beginning.  You see that
			private?

	They look down the runway a few hundred feet.  A private
	waves, and starts painting a red line across the runway.
	Another private, close by, paints a green line.

					DOOLITTLE
			Green means go.  Red means dead.

	MONTAGE - THE TRAINING - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	The pilots practice takeoff's.  Red is Rafe's copilot;
	Anthony is Danny's.  Nobody can get airborne before the red
	line.

	INT.  EGLIN FIELD - LECTURE ROOM - DAY

	Doolittle is instructing the men.

					DOOLITTLE
			You're having trouble getting airborne in
			the shorter space because you're not
			revving the engines enough.  You've got
			to push them to the limit before you ever
			start to move.

	Rafe is distracted; he's lost in though, looking at Danny --
	and looks away just before Danny realizes it.

	MONTAGE CONTINUES - EXT.  EGLIN FIELD RUNWAY - DAY

	Pilots practice hard, revving the engines, taking off
	hard...all of them crossing the red line, takeoff after
	takeoff.  Rafe pushes his engine hard and still crosses by
	twenty feet; Danny pushes even harder, and misses by ten
	feet.

	Doolittle watches with Greening from the edge of the runway.

					DOOLITTLE
			We've got to get the weight down.

	INT.  HANGER - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	Greening has removed the intensely complex Norden sight from
	a bomber and put in on a table for Doolittle.

					GREENING
			Okay, forty pounds gone.  And in it's
			place, this.

	He shows Doolittle an aluminum strip on a swivel.

					GREENING
			Weight, 3 ounces.  Cost, 20 cents.

					DOOLITTLE
			Does it work?

	EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	Doolittle pilots a B-25 at treetop level onto a practice
	bombing range.  Greening uses the makeshift sight, and drops
	a 500-lb sack of flour, right in the middle of the bull's-eye
	target chalked on the ground.

	EXT.  FLORIDA COAST - DAY

	The B-25's are practicing, flying at treetop level.  Red is
	Rafe's copilot, Anthony is Danny's.  Doolittle is flying the
	lead bomber.

					DOOLITTLE
			Right down to the treetops.  Low as you
			can.

	Rafe brings his plane down, smoothly.  Then Danny's plane
	appears -- under him.  Rafe jerks his nose up quickly.
	Rafe's angry; Danny's laughing -- but he scares the shit out
	of his crew.

	EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - NIGHT

	Danny's outside, looking up at the moon.  Rafe appears and
	moves up beside him.

					DANNY
			Fun today.  Like old times.

					RAFE
			Danny, what the hell are you trying to do
			out there?

					DANNY
			What do you mean?  I'm just doing what
			we've always done.

					RAFE
			No.  You're trying to beat me.

					DANNY
			We've always tried to beat each other.

					RAFE
			Bullshit.  We've played with each other,
			pushed each other.  This is different.
			Like you want to prove that you're
			better than me.  Who's that for --
			Evelyn?

	Danny's anger flares for a moment -- but Rafe's hit home.

					DANNY
			Maybe just trying to measure up.

					RAFE
			What's between you and her is between you
			and her.  But here's what's between you
			and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny.
			And you're mine.

	Danny's caught off-guard.

					RAFE
			When we were growing up, I had
			everything.  You had nothing.  You
			climbed out of a hole I couldn't even see
			the bottom of.  I think maybe when I went
			off to England, I was trying to measure
			up to you.  Measuring up's over.  Let's
			just look out for each other.  Okay?

	They embrace, closer now than ever.

	MONTAGE - INTERCUT

	with the planes practicing their short takeoffs, we see
	Roosevelt in one of his fireside chats, his voice broadcast
	across America...

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			Good evening, America...

	Families all across America are gathered around radios,
	listening.

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			I'm told that 80% of American families
			are listening to these fireside chats of
			ours, and I'm happy we can come together,
			as one great American family.  I'd like
			each of you within the sound of my voice
			to find a map...

	The FAMILIES do, gathering around encyclopedias, school
	books, any reference they have, spread on kitchen tables,
	suburban living room rugs, or farmhouse hearths...

	And the B-25's, all sixteen of them, begin a journey in
	formation, flying at treetop level across America:
	Mississippi delta land, Texas plains, Arizona mesas...

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			Look at the Pacific Ocean.  It covers
			half the surface of the earth.  And look
			at the great Atlantic.  The oceans both
			divide and connect us to our enemies, and
			either they will come to us, or we will
			go to them...

	The formation of B-25's reaches San Francisco.

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

	Doolittle leads the bombers to a landing.  IN RAFE'S PLANE,
	everybody's wondering why they're here.

					RED
			N-naval station?  What's g-going on?

					RAFE
			Wish I knew, Red.

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO AIR FIELD - DAY

	The crews climb from their planes, and almost before they're
	out, teams of men use straps and cranes to hoist the bombers
	onto flatbed trucks.  Doolittle walks up to Rafe and Danny,
	watching the baffling operation.

					DOOLITTLE
			Want to see where they're going?

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - EVENING

	Cranes lift the planes from the trucks and hoist them onto
	the flight decks of the carrier USS HORNET.  The pilots stand
	on the pier, watching.

					ANTHONY
			I guess that settles it.  Somewhere in
			the Pacific.

					RED
			With a s-short r-runway.

	They all gather around Doolittle as he moves up to them.

					DOOLITTLE
			You have rooms at the Biltmore.  I
			suggest a nice meal and a good night's
			sleep.  We leave tomorrow.

	Doolittle walks to join a captain.

	INT./ EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL - NIGHT

	The pilots get off the bus and carry their duffels into the
	lobby.

					ANTHONY
			San Francisco, here we are!

					DANNY
				(grinning)
			I don't reckon we can get hogbrains and
			grits, but I hear a man can eat good in
			this town.

					RAFE
			I'm gonna turn in.  I hate being on the
			water.  I think this is the last sleep
			I'll get for awhile.

	INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT

	The other guys drop their duffels with the bell hops; Rafe
	moves to the reception desk.

					RAFE
			McCawley.

	The manager hands him a key, and smiles curiously.

					MANAGER
			Have fun.

	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Rafe enters his room and finds the light on...and Evelyn's
	there waiting.

					RAFE
			What?...

					EVELYN
			They were bringing back a ship full of
			wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I
			wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I
			needed to see you before you go.

					RAFE
			It must of been a convincing letter.

					EVELYN
			It was.  I couldn't have you go away,
			wherever it is...to war...without knowing
			something.  You think I made a choice, of
			Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have
			a choice.  I'm pregnant.

	The blood drains from Rafe's heart.  Yet he finds the
	strength to move to her.  She turns away, so she won't throw
	her arms around him.

					RAFE
			Does Danny know?

	She shakes her head, refuses to cry.

					EVELYN
			I wasn't sure, until the day you turned
			up alive.  I never had a chance to tell
			him.  Now I can't have him thinking about
			this when he needs to be thinking about
			his mission, and how to come back from
			it.

	She turns and faces him again.

					EVELYN
			I want you thinking about that too.  Just
			come back.
				(beat)
			Rafe, I see it in your face.  You're
			thinking you don't have anything to live
			for.  Don't you dare think that way.
			I'll never write a letter, or look at a
			sunset, without thinking of you.  I'll
			love you my whole life.  And I want you
			to live.

	She looks at him, her eyes bright with tears, but still she
	refuses to cry.  They both know they can't touch, or they'll
	never let go.  She walks past him, out of the room, closing
	the door softly behind her.

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - DAY

	The USS HORNET clears the Golden Gate Bridge, with cruisers
	and destroyers rounding out its battle group.

	Rafe and Danny stand on the flight deck, watching the city
	recede behind them.

	Evelyn is on a hilltop watching them go.  Danny can't see
	her, doesn't know she's there.  Rafe can't see her either --
	but he knows.

					SHIP'S INTERCOM
			Army pilots to the briefing room.

	INT.  THE CARRIER HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	The pilots are gathered expectantly in the carrier's
	conference room.  Doolittle strides in.

					DOOLITTLE
			Gentlemen, I can now tell you that the
			target of this mission is Tokyo.

	The pilots love it.  The ones who have not seen battle are
	grinning and vocal.  Rafe, Danny, Anthony, and Red are
	quieter, savoring the prospect of revenge.

					RED
			And where's the secret base, Sir?  The
			one we t-takeoff from.

					DOOLITTLE
			The navy will get us to within 400 miles
			of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off
			the carriers from there.

	Suddenly the pilots don't like the sound of this.

					ANTHONY
			Sir, has this ever been done, launching
			an army bomber off a navy carrier?

					DOOLITTLE
			No.  Any other questions?

					RED
			C-Colonel, we been p-practicing
			takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land
			on these carriers d-decks.

					DOOLITTLE
			We won't have the fuel to get back to the
			carriers; they'll turn and run back to
			Hawaii the minute we're airborne.

					RED
			Then wh-where do we land?

					DOOLITTLE
			I have a phrase I want you all to
			memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It
			means "I am an American."  In Chinese.

	Absolute silence among the pilots.

	EXT.  FLIGHT DECK OF THE HORNET - DAY

	The sailors who man the flight deck look at each other with
	bafflement as the worried pilots pace from one end of the
	deck to the other.  They're in a line like ducks, Rafe in the
	lead and the others following, counting steps, each man
	measuring the distance.  Shaking their heads, worrying.

	They stop at the end and look down at the sea far below them;
	it's dizzying.  Anthony shoves Red for fun before grabbing
	his shoulder to stop him from falling.

					RED
			A-a-asshole!... Maybe it's l-longer
			going this way.

	He starts pacing back the other way, as if the ship's longer
	in that direction.  The other pilots watch him for a moment,
	then follow him, counting again.

	Rafe and Danny are left standing alone at the end of the
	flight deck.  Far over the surging sea.

					DANNY
			It's shorter than our practice runway.

					RAFE
			They'll turn the ship into the wind
			before we launch.  That'll help.

					DANNY
			We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of
			bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got
			another Chinese phrase for Doolittle.
			"Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It
			means "Who the fuck thought up this
			shit?"

	Doolittle appears right beside them.

					DOOLITTLE
			He was a navy man.

	Doolittle walks away.

					RAFE
			Maybe we'll be lucky with the weather.

								SMASH TO:

	EXT.  PACIFIC - A FEROCIOUS STORM - NIGHT

	The Hornet tosses, bashed by a vicious storm.

	INT.  CARRIER HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	The ships is rolling; most of the fliers are green.
	Doolittle stands at the podium.

					DOOLITTLE
			Since we'll be on our own once we're in
			the air, I thought I had a good idea
			letting each crew select it's own target.

	He looks at a pile of paper slips in front of him.

					DOOLITTLE
			Now we have fifteen requests for the
			Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo
			baseball stadium.

					RED
			I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed
			to p-play baseball.

					DOOLITTLE
			I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But
			I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The
			idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge.
			We're here to prove to them that they're
			neither invincible nor superior.  So
			let's try this again.  Military targets
			only.

					RED
			Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy.
			To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And
			to practice it, ya gotta play --

					DOOLITTLE
			No baseball diamonds, Red.

					RED
			Y-Yes Sir.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

	The storm is subsiding, but it's still raining.  From the
	bridge of the Hornet, they spot the ENTERPRISE.

					ADMIRAL
			The Enterprise will ride shotgun when we
			launch the bombers.  They wanted our
			carriers at Pearl, and now we've come to
			them.  If the Japanese get us, they'll be
			having dinner in San Francisco next
			month.

	EXT.  FLIGHT DECK - THE HORNET - DAY

	The preparations begin.  Deck crews move the B-25's to the
	rear of the flight deck.  Fueling teams top off the bomber's
	gas tanks.  Ordnance men hoist four bombs into each aircraft,
	and the army gunners load ammunition for the machine guns.
	Greening checks the planes' mechanical and hydraulic systems.

	And once again the pilots are out pacing the deck distance.
	It's turned into a game for them, walking off nerves.  As
	Rafe and Danny pass.

					RAFE
			It's not getting any longer.

					DANNY
			Longer?  It's getting shorter.

	INT.  HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	Doolittle is laying out the plan for all the pilots.

					DOOLITTLE
			We'll take off late this afternoon.  I'll
			hit Tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary
			bombs.  You'll come after me at night,
			guided by the fires.  Then it's on to
			China, where you'll arrive at dawn,
			guided to their airfields by the homing
			beacons the Chinese are going to switch
			on for us.  That's if everything is
			perfect -- like every other military
			mission I've ever been involved with.

	Doolittle looks around the room.  No one's smiling.

					DOOLITTLE
			Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane --
			then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you.
			I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't
			make it, you don't go.

					RAFE
			Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you
			make it or not.

					DOOLITTLE
			I know.

	EXT.  BRIDGE OF THE CRUISER NASHVILLE - DAY

	The cruiser Nashville is at the perimeter of the task force.
	It's lookouts spot Japanese patrol boats ahead.

	INT.  BRIDGE OF THE ENTERPRISE - DAY

	The message is handed to Admiral Halsey.

					OFFICER
			Sir, lookouts on the cruisers report
			patrol boats, ten miles away!

					HALSEY
			The Japs have set up a picket line!
			Order the cruisers to open fire!  We've
			got to sink them before they get a
			message away.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

	The cruiser NASHVILLE begins firing rounds at the Japanese
	patrol boat; round after round misses.

	INT.  HORNET'S RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The operators hear the excited voices of Japanese radio
	traffic.

					RADIO OPERATOR
			They've reported our position!  Tell the
			Admiral.

	EXT.  HORNET - DAY

	Doolittle hurries up to the command bridge, with the naval
	officers sent by the Admiral to fetch him.  Doolittle sees
	the cruisers next to the carrier firing its guns -- at
	Japanese boats in the distance.

	INT.  BRIDGE OF THE HORNET - DAY

	Doolittle finds the Admiral gathered with his staff, their
	mood is grim.

					DOOLITTLE
			How far are we from Tokyo?

					ADMIRAL
			Seven hundred miles.

	INT.  PILOT'S WARD ROOMS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES

	Rafe, Danny, and the other pilots are alone at their bunks,
	taking advantage of the lull before the mission.

	Rafe has paper and pen to write a letter, but he can't think
	of anything to write.

	Danny holds the "Picture of Paradise" that Sammy took, of
	Evelyn and the nurses in the sun.  He tucks it inside his
	shirt, when he hears --

					LOUDSPEAKER
			Army pilots, man your planes!

	EXT.  FLIGHT DECK - THE HORNET - DAY

	The pilots run onto deck.  The cruiser next to the Hornet is
	still firing away at the Japanese patrol boat.

	Doolittle runs onto deck, shouting orders.

					DOOLITTLE
			Load in every bit of extra gas you can
			carry!  And strip everything you don't
			need out of the planes.  I mean
			EVERYTHING!

	EXT.  HORNET - FLIGHT DECK - STRIPPING THE PLANES - DAY

	It's starting to rain but the guys don't notice at all.
	They're stripping seats out of the planes, tossing out their
	own gear.

	Greening pulls the machine guns out of the rear of the planes
	and puts in broomsticks painted black.

	Off in the distance the Japanese patrol boat takes a hit and
	explodes.  Rafe and Danny meet between their bombers.

					DANNY
			Broomsticks instead of tail guns.

					RAFE
			We'll get separated over the target, but
			you and I will rendezvous for the run to
			China.  I'm on your wing.

					DANNY
			And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.

					RAFE
			Home of the Brave.

	They climb into their bombers.

	EXT.  HORNET - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

	The engines are revving.  The tachs are showing redline.  The
	crews are in their planes.  Doolittle is first, just ahead of
	Rafe and Danny's B-25's.

	The battle pennants whip, the props blur, the wheels strain
	against the brakes; from the cockpits the flight deck looks
	impossibly short...and the American flag cracks in the wind.

	And now every pilot looks at Doolittle's plane...

	Doolittle starts the run down the flight deck...faster...the
	end looming.  He turns the plane almost vertical, standing it
	on its props...and lifts away smoothly.

	The sailors on deck cheer, like the Japanese did before Pearl
	Harbor.

	Rafe, Danny, and the others take off too.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	The B-25's head toward Japan.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - THE AMERICAN TASK FORCE - DAY

	Admiral Halsey, on the deck of the ENTERPRISE, watches as the
	last plane takes off.  The planes recede in the distance,
	racing just a few feet over the water, toward Japan.

					HALSEY
			Of all the other things this mission is
			doing that have never been done before...
			I've never sent out planes that I wasn't
			going to see safely home.  Let's get out
			of here.

	The task force runs for home.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	At first the planes are together; Rafe and Danny can see each
	other off each other's wing, and Doolittle's plane is ahead.
	The others are grouped after them.  They maintain strict
	radio silence, and can communicate only with gestures, hand
	signals, or a flasher for Morse code.  When Rafe speaks to
	the crew of his own plane, it's by pressing an intercom
	sender to his throat.

					RAFE
			What's our ETA for Tokyo?

	The bombardier/navigator is already working out the numbers
	at his plotting table in the center of the plane.

					NAVIGATOR
			Almost exactly at 12 noon.

					RED
			High n-noon.  I k-kinda like that.

	Rafe looks over to Danny and gives him a thumbs up.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

	Danny calls back to his GUNNER, who is watching the fuel
	supply.

					DANNY
			We got a 25-mile-an-hour head wind.  How
			we doing with fuel?

					GUNNER
			How do you think?

	The gunner is already pouring gas into the tanks from the
	extra cans.

	Anthony stands and moves back to the rear of the plane, pulls
	a piece of chalk from his pocket and writes on the nose of
	the bombs -- "For America,"  "For Pearl Harbor,"  "For the
	Arizona,"  "For Billy."

	-- Rafe flies, lost in thought...

	-- Evelyn is back at Pearl, struggling to keep her mind on
	   her work.

	-- Danny is looking at his gauges, then at the picture in
	   his shirt.

	EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	It's a pleasant day, and the people of Tokyo are in a
	confident, happy mood.  They're shopping, smiling, enjoying
	beautiful spring weather.  The Emperor is on the garden of
	his palace having lunch.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	The American planes are coming.

	INT.  DOOLITTLE'S PLANE - DAY

	He and his navigator confer.

					DOOLITTLE'S NAVIGATOR
			Time for the others to break off.

	His copilot uses the flashes to signal the other planes.
	They break off for their individual targets, every plane now
	on it's own.

	INT.  JAPANESE AIR DEFENSE STATION - DAY

	This is the nerve center of Tokyo's defense.  An OFFICER
	receives a message and reports to his supervisor.

					JAPANESE DEFENSE OFFICER
			Coastal stations report a low flying
			plane coming in off the sea.

					SUPERVISOR
			From the sea?... That couldn't be right,
			it must be part of the air raid practice
			this morning.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	The planes reach the Japanese coastline, and start skimming
	over treetop level.

	EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

	The office of an anti-aircraft battery blows its whistle; his
	crew mount their guns and swerves them around.  The officer
	whistle's again and checks his watch.

					ANTI-AIRCRAFT OFFICER
			Not bad.

	The crew dismount their guns; just a drill.

	EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	The Japanese people are unaware of the drill.  People are
	browsing through open-air shops, where new radios are turned
	on, playing music.  And Tokyo Rose is talking -- in English
	and Japanese.

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			It is another beautiful day in Tokyo, as
			all of Japan basks in a new day of
			victory.

	INT.  THE PLANES - DAY

	Coma, Danny's navigator, picks this up.

					COMA
			Listen to this -- it's Tokyo Rose.

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			Our brave sailors and soldiers, inspired
			by our divine Emperor, have pushed the
			Americans from the Pacific.

	These words go through the plane; and in the other planes
	they hear it too.

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			But hiding at home will not save them.
			Each time the Americans have tasted the
			samurai spirit, they have learned the
			bitter taste of defeat, while Japan is
			embraced by the divine wind that has
			protected our island for seven centuries.

	EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

	The planes reach Tokyo, and flash across the rooftops.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

					ANTHONY
			We'll give that bitch something to
			announce.

	Danny and Rafe give each other a wave, and divert toward
	their separate targets.  Each plane is on its own now.

	EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

	Doolittle's plane flashes right over the Emperor's palace.
	The Emperor sits in the garden, meditating.

	EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	Mothers walking their children see the planes flash by
	overhead, and like the people at Pearl, they think they are
	friendlies.  A toddler points up and smiles.  His mother
	picks him up and hugs him happily.

					JAPANESE MOTHER
			Yes!  So beautiful!

	INT.  THE PLANES - DAY

	Rafe's bombardier works his 20-cent bombsight, as Rafe holds
	the plane steady, bringing it up to 200 feet.

	They scan for fighter or anti-aircraft fire.  There isn't
	any.

					RAFE
			Open bomb bay doors.

	DANNY'S PLANE runs toward its target...

	DOOLITTLE'S PLANE races over Tokyo...

					GUNNER
			Bomb bay doors open, sir.

					RAFE
			It's all yours.

	The bombardier hits the first switch.  The bomb falls toward
	a factory.

	It strikes home, right on target.  The blast is shocking --
	it blows debris higher than the plane.

	EXT.  TOKYO - THE BOMBING - VARIOUS SHOTS

	The individual planes drop their bombs, four per plane, on
	shipyards, factories, oil supplies, weapons facilities.
	Their bombing is highly accurate.

	On the ground, at the open-air market, for a brief moment
	Radio Tokyo goes silent; then --

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			We interrupt this broadcast... Tokyo is
			being bombed!

	EXT.  THE EMPEROR'S PALACE - DAY

	The Emperor looks up at the sound of air raid sirens and
	distant explosions.

					EMPEROR'S ATTENDANT
			Surely just a drill, Divine One.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - DAY

					NAVIGATOR
			Last bomb away.

	It slams into a factory, blowing debris everywhere and
	turning the factory into an inferno.

	Rafe's tail gunner sees Zeros swarming in with vengeance.

					GUNNER
			We got Zeros!  And they're pissed off!

	Rafe changes course quickly.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

	Anti-aircraft FLAK bursts in the sky in front of them; Danny
	takes evasive action.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - ABOVE TOKYO - DAY

	Rafe pushes the engines to top speed and changes course
	again; but the B-25's can't outrun the Zeros.  Their fire
	chews into the bomber's tail, hitting the gunner.  Red
	scrambles back to find the gunner dead.

					RAFE
			Can you get 'em off us?

	Red reacting to bullets coming through the rear of the
	fuselage, looks at the brooms protruding from the rear of the
	plane.

					RED
			Whatta ya want me to do, sweep 'em!

	As the bombardier, navigator, and Red jump onto the other
	machine guns, Rafe looks for a way out.  He dives down toward
	the city.  The Zeros follow.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER TOKYO - DAY

	Rafe takes the B-25 right down among the buildings, sometimes
	even having to spin the wings to get through.  The Zeros
	can't keep up with this...

	But Rafe can't keep it up long, either; they break out into
	open ground rail yards, where there's no place for him to
	hide...

	The Zeros come in to chew him up...

	But they take fire from another B-25 -- Danny's -- coming in
	to save Rafe's plane.  Rafe now uses the radio.

					RAFE
			Danny, get the hell out of here!

	But Danny stays, mixing it up with the Zeros; with both
	B-25's together, their machine guns down one Zero and damage
	another.  But there are too many.

	Rafe sees clouds coming in, and fog.

					RAFE
			Danny, run for the clouds!

	The bombers race toward the clouds, and make it; the Zeros
	lose them.

	EXT.  SKIES - BROKEN CLOUDS - DAY

	Rafe and Danny keep broken contact through the clouds, and
	settle in for the long run to China.

	INT.  RAFE'S COCKPIT - DAY

					RAFE
			We burned a lot of fuel back there.
			Flash them and ask about their supply.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

	Anthony reads the Morse code.

					ANTHONY
			"How's your fuel?"

	Danny looks across to Rafe and shakes his head.

	INT.  ROOSEVELT'S RESIDENCE - HYDE PARK, NY - DAY

	Roosevelt is at his desk when General Marshall enters.

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President.
			Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own
			broadcast to make the announcement.

					ROOSEVELT
			Have the planes made it to China?

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			There've been some complications, Sir.
			The Chinese didn't receive our request
			for homing beacons until is was too late
			to get them set.  And the planes had to
			take off so early they may lack fuel to
			make the mainland anyway.

					ROOSEVELT
			So those brave men are flying blind and
			running out of fuel.

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			The Chinese are sending out search
			parties to try to find the crews before
			the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes
			make it.

					ROOSEVELT
			God help them.

	EXT.  SEA OF JAPAN - DUSK

	They've climbed above the clouds; the fliers are exhausted.

	The sun is beginning to set.  Rafe stares at it...

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DUSK

	The place is white again -- the white of bandages and casts.
	Everyone is busy, and even the wounded are looking out for
	each other; a man with his arms in an airplane splint holds a
	spoon and feeds a badly burned buddy.  Evelyn and her
	overworked nurses are looking after the critical cases.  But
	as she covers the windows with blackout curtains, she stops
	for just a moment to stare at the sun's last rays.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - NIGHT

	Colonel Doolittle can make out mountains below them.

					DOOLITTLE
			We'll fly till we run out of fuel, then
			bail out.

	Just then his engines start to sputter.

					DOOLITTLE
			Chute!

	He puts the plane on auto-pilot and the men move to the
	hatches.  Three guys go out; it's just Doolittle and his
	copilot left.

					DOOLITTLE
			Nobody else is gonna make it either.  If
			I live through this, they're gonna put me
			in Leavenworth Prison.

	They jump.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

	Coma moves up to Danny.

					COMA
			We're running out of fuel.  And I can't
			find the beacon.

	Danny gestures across to Rafe that he hears nothing in his
	radio phones.  Rafe gestures the same thing back.

	They look down and the entire ground is covered with clouds.

					RAFE
			I don't know if we're over sea or land.
			Drop flares and try to spot something.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - NIGHT

	They drop flares; they disappear into the cloud cover and
	tell them nothing.

	EXT.  SKIES - RAFE AND DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

	Danny's engines are sputtering; his gunner pours the last
	drops of gas into the tanks.

					DANNY
			Flash Rafe.  We're gonna bail.

	Red sees Anthony signal.

					RED
			They've gotta jump.

					RAFE
			Not unless we know he's over land!

	Rafe yells at Danny, as if he could hear --

					RAFE
			You are not bailing out into water!

					RAFE'S NAVIGATOR
			Coastline below!

	Through a break in the clouds they spot a rocky shoreline.

					RAFE
			We've got coast!  Signal him to climb and
			jump.

	Red signals; Danny's plane signals back.

					RED
			They don't have fuel to make altitude.
			He's gonna set it down in the water.

	Rafe looks over at Danny, who is gesturing; he gives up on
	the hand signals and grabs the flasher; Red reads the Morse
	code...

					RED
			Y-O-U... G-O.  You go on.

	Rafe grabs the flasher and angrily flashes back two letters.

					RAFE
			N-O!  We stay together!  I'll go in
			first.

	Rafe turns his bomber and Danny follows, their planes arcing
	down toward the rocky coast; it's hairy, the clouds masking
	their view, as the altimeter winds down... At the last moment
	they see rocks looming out of the surf.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT

	He's shouting to his crew --

					RAFE
			Hang on tight!  I'll put her in the
			smooth water and we'll swim in!

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

	His engines are sputtering, catching, sputtering; he fights
	to stay in control.

	EXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT

	Rafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the
	engine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface;
	then the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a
	wall, flipping over it's nose.

	DANNY'S PLANE is struggling; when he tries to add throttle,
	the engines sputter out.  The plane drops, skips once on the
	surface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first.

	Danny and Anthony are ejected through the top of the
	fuselage; Coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose
	of the plane.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT

	Rafe and Red come to in the plane inverted and sinking.  They
	react, unbuckling, grabbing for their crewmates as the plane
	is quickly filling.  The navigator and gunner are
	unconscious; the bombardier is dead.  Red struggles with the
	hatch and can't make it budge.

					RAFE
			It won't open til the plane fills!

	They struggle to breath as the water envelops them.  But as
	the water reaches the top, Rafe takes a last breath and dives
	to the hatch; it comes open, and they swim up, dragging the
	rest of the crew.

	EXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT

	They break the surface, and struggle to shore with the
	unconscious navigator and gunner.

	Rafe's looking everywhere; he sees Danny's plane crashed
	against the rock.  He fights his way through the surf to
	Danny's plane, Red following.

	Rafe finds Danny face up in the water.

	Red finds Anthony on the rock.  He's face up, but as Red
	lifts him he finds the back of Anthony's head is gone.

	The rest of Danny's crew are floating in the surf, dead.
	Rafe and Red pull Danny to shore.

					RAFE
			Danny!  DANNY!

	Danny's eyes flutter open; he sees Rafe and mumbles --

					DANNY
			I've made better landings.

	Danny's hand gropes to his throat; Rafe finds a V shaped
	shard of the fuselage hooked into his neck.

	Rafe grabs it, trying to bend it open; the sharp metal cuts
	his hands, but he keeps straining.  It won't work, He pulls
	his .45 from his jacket and tries to pry the metal.  It works
	a bit; he tosses the pistol aside and grabs the shard again,
	and opens it.

					RAFE
			You hang on, Danny!  You hang on!  You're
			gonna make it!

	Rafe's head snaps forward, crunched with the butt of a rifle;
	a Japanese patrol, four men, have arrived.  They're angry,
	scared, hyped.  They knock Red down too, yelling and
	brandishing their rifles at the fliers on the beach, living
	and dead.

	The Japanese officer is barking orders.  They find the
	Captain's insignia on Danny's jacket, and begin binding him
	to a yoke, his wrists tied to the wood like a crucifixion, a
	wire around his neck.  They find the navigator unconscious,
	but alive.  The officer snaps a single word and a soldier
	shoots the navigator.

	The others wire Rafe's ankles together... Rafe is
	emotionless.

	RAFE'S CONSCIOUSNESS fades in and out.  He hears Danny
	choking, and his mind sees Danny as a boy those long years
	ago, being carried by the neck across the field by his
	father...

	Then Rafe sees THE PRESENT:  Danny being half-carried, half-
	dragged by the neck by two Japanese.  The officer is pulling
	Red along, hands bound behind him.  And Rafe starts moving,
	being dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky
	sand.

	His hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock.

	The whole world slows down.

	He clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny.  And as
	the man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the
	face.

	The officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling
	Red, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle
	too.  The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when
	Danny slams him down from behind.

	The fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim
	for Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from
	behind.

	The Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by
	scythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just
	arriving.

	Rafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside.  Danny
	lies on his back, clutching his wound as if to hold onto his
	life.

					RAFE
			Danny...

					DANNY
			I can't make it.

					RAFE
			Yes you can.

	But Danny is silent, his eyes drifting shut, and in that
	moment Rafe thinks he is gone already.  Then Danny's eyes
	drift open, finding him.

					DANNY
			Take care of Evelyn.

	The words almost kill Rafe, filling him with grief.  From
	somewhere he finds the strength to say --

					RAFE
			I will.  And your baby.
				(beat)
			You're gonna be a father.

	Did Danny hear?  His eyes are closed again.  But his head
	comes up; Rafe takes it, and Danny pulls him closer to
	whisper --

					DANNY
			No.  You are.

	Rafe cradles Danny in his arms.  Danny's eyes are open, but
	Rafe sees no light there.

					RAFE
			Danny... Land of the free... Land of the
			free...

	But Danny will never answer him again.  Rafe hugs Danny
	tight, and weeps.

	EXT.  VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	The news of the raid hits Washington...and the rest of
	America.  If it isn't wild celebration; when people see the
	headline:  AIR RAID ON TOKYO, and DOOLITTLE DOES MUCH; their
	faces change, as if finally told what they already knew --
	that America would prevail.

					VOICE OVER
			The Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment
			of America's war with Japan.  Before it,
			America knew nothing but defeat; after
			it, nothing but victory.
				(beat)
			One crew of Doolittle's raiders made it to
			Vladivostok, Russia, where they were
			interred for much of the war.  Thirteen
			planes crash landed in China, where the
			Chinese people helped the Americans
			escape, and had their villages destroyed
			and citizens executed by the Japanese
			forces of occupation.  Two crews were
			captured by the Japanese and three fliers
			were executed without trial, called "war
			criminals" by the Japanese.  Jimmy
			Doolittle was promoted to General, and
			given the medal of honor.

	We see the ceremony at the White House, as Roosevelt presents
	Doolittle with the metal.

	EXT.  TENNESSEE - DAY

	Out by the crop dusting landing field is a memorial to Danny
	Walker, with an American flag flying high above it.  Standing
	at the memorial are Rafe and Evelyn.  Rafe holds a child in
	his arms, a boy, named Danny.

								FADE OUT.

					THE END
PEARL HARBOR


                              by

                        Randall Wallace























                          EARLY DRAFT








	Out of BLACK we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by.

	EXT.  POV OF AN AIRPLANE

	Flying over American heartland.  We see the earth through the
	pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the
	plane swooping down and storming over the ground.

	THE PLANE

	is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants.  It
	releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again...

	Up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like
	honey over family farms stretching to the horizon.  Maybe
	it's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee.  But as long as
	there's been an America, men have fought and died for this
	place -- as volunteers.

	Far off, but visible from the plane is

	A BARN - DAY

	The barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says
	"McCawley Crop Dusting." Another plane noise, this one made
	by kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an
	old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats,
	and wheels.

	The boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg
	they've replaced the seat with.  They've even attached a 2x4
	as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help.  They
	wear overalls and have bowl haircuts:  RAFE and DANNY, 10
	years old.

					RAFE
			Bandits at 2 o'clock.

					DANNY
			Power dive!

	They buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls,
	Rafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other.

					RAFE
			It's Germans!

					DANNY
			Kill the bastards!

	Rafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go
	right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine
	gun and engine sounds.

					RAFE
			Good shooting, Danny!

					DANNY
			Good shooting, Rafe!

					RAFE
			Land of the free...

					DANNY
			Home of the brave!

					RAFE
			There's another one!

	Their vocal motors roar again... But a man's hand grabs Danny
	by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit.

	It's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his
	hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still
	left -- are rotting.  He's also missing an arm; but the one
	that's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it.

					DANNY'S FATHER
			You no count boy!  Johnson come lookin',
			said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel
			his pig shed, and I can't find you no
			place.

					DANNY
			Daddy, I told you I was comin' here.

	His father slaps him off his feet.  Rafe is so horrified he
	can't get a sound out.  Danny isn't even surprised.  But when
	his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps
	so tight they choke him, he struggles.  It does no good; his
	father starts marching across the field, dragging and
	strangling Danny.

					DANNY
			Da!... Dad...

	The father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until
	CRACK!  The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking
	him to the ground and making him drop Danny.

	The father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the
	2x4 like a bat.

					RAFE
			Let him alone!

	The father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet.

					DANNY
			Rafe... Daddy... No!

	The man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board.

					RAFE
			I'll bust you open, you...German!

	The words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken
	brain.  He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom
	of blood to his mouth.  He wipes it with his hand, but blood
	clings to his teeth.  He chokes out --

					DANNY'S FATHER
			I fought the Germans.

	He looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's
	just done.  He turns and staggers away.

	Danny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by
	something deeper than blood.  Then Danny runs off after his
	father.

					DANNY
			Daddy!  Daddy!  Wait.

	Danny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away
	with him.

	The crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind
	Rafe.  The pilot, RAFE'S FATHER, shuts off the engine.

					RAFE'S FATHER
			What's goin' on, son?

					RAFE
			Nothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get
			him.

	Rafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4
	propeller.  His father looks toward Danny and his father,
	walking away, then looks at his own son.

					RAFE'S FATHER
			Hey, boy -- you wanna go up?

	Rafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his
	father's lap.  As his father cranks the engine and tucks him
	into the harness, Rafe says --

					RAFE
			Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up
			too?

					RAFE'S FATHER
			Sure will, son.

	The engine races to life...and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  NEW JERSEY AIR BASE - DAY

	American P-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming
	and wind singing by their wings.

	There are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we
	focus on two:  RAFE MCCAWLEY has grown lean and handsome.
	And DANNY WALKER is very much the same.

	Their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while
	the other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and
	Danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high,
	the other diving and coming back up in his place,
	leapfrogging.

	It scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and
	out, so close.  The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through
	binoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			McCawley!  Walker!  Cut that out!

					RAFE
			I thought this was a training flight.
			I'm just trying to give Danny some
			training.

					DANNY
			Not on your best day, boy!

	Rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction
	he was moving before.  Danny reacts almost instantly...
	leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out
	of everybody else.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			That's it, get into a wedge!

	The squadron responds, forming up into a tight V, Rafe and
	Danny just behind and on either side of the center.

					RAFE
			Didn't you say test the limits?

					DANNY
			Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better
			line up a couple dozen women on the
			GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the
			air!

	Rafe grins, loving the challenge.  Then he and Danny do the
	leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the V.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Everybody down!

	EXT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - DAY

	The planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut
	down their props, slide back the canopies and hop down.  We
	see young pilots we'll get to know:  ANTHONY, BILLY, RED.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Where are McCawley and Walker?

	EXT.  RAFE AND DANNY - STILL IN THE AIR - DAY

	They've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now
	heading right at each other, like two bullets playing
	chicken.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Aw shit...

	INT.  THE COCKPITS

	From Rafe and Danny's POV, the rush is awesome.

	THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND watch in awe as the P-40's get so
	close they can't possibly get out of each other's way.
	Billy, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown
	out the sound of the collision...

	At the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that
	their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other
	belly to belly.

	IN THE COCKPITS

	Rafe and Danny burst out laughing.

	THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND

	laugh and congratulate each other.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			You know what they say... You can take the
			crop duster out of the country -- but
			don't put him in a P-40.

	Rafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him.  Danny has
	Rafe's plane in his sights.

					DANNY
			If I had guns I'd be chewing up your --

	Rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny.

					RAFE
			If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.

	They're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny.  But
	as Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and
	snaps the nose of his plane straight up.

	THE OTHER PILOTS stop laughing.

					ANTHONY
			He's doing an inside loop!

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Aw, shit...

	Danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come
	in behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.

					DANNY
			Yee-hawww!!!

	Danny taxis his plane over to join the others.  He's grinning
	as he slides back his cockpit cover; then --

					DANNY
			Where's Rafe?

	Red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the
	air.  Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to
	refasten his harness.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			You're down, Walker!  That's an order!

					DANNY
			What about him?

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			He's not taking my orders anymore.

	Danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he
	notices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.

					DANNY
			He's gonna do it.

					BILLY
			Do what?

					DANNY
			It.
				(beat)
			Aw, shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

	RAFE'S PLANE reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above
	them, and seems to pause in the air.

					DANNY
			I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.
			I shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

					BILLY
			Why?

					DANNY
			Cause now he's gonna do an outside loop.

					TRAINING CAPTAIN
			Aw shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

	Anthony and Billy join in, like an involuntary chant --

					ANTHONY & BILLY
			Aw shit shit shit...

	RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT, is tightly controlled, yet serene.  He
	noses the plane into a power dive.

	The P-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going
	so fast it begins to shudder.

	THE OTHER PILOTS are transfixed.  Red is so nervous he can't
	get the words out.

					RED
			Aw sh- sh- sh- sh-

					BILLY
			Shit.

					RED
			Yeah.

					DANNY
			You can do it, Rafe.  You can do it.

	The P-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed,
	snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the
	runway.  Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the
	asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his
	head.

	He pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside
	of the circle.  The plane reaches the top of its arc, and
	almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the
	earth, only this time he has very little altitude.  The plane
	hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the
	curve...

	And makes it full circle.  Rafe's head now is barely a foot
	off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted.

	THE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers.

	RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile.

	He lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for
	the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head.

	Danny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his
	canopy.  Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.

					DANNY
			You could've killed yourself, you stupid
			bastard!

	He dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe.

					DANNY
			That was the most beautiful thing I ever
			saw.

	INT.  COLONEL DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - DAY

	COLONEL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, mid-forties, is commander of the
	base.  He's as tough as he is good in the air.  And right now
	he's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before
	him.

					DOOLITTLE
			There are some people who think the
			outside loop is reckless and
			irresponsible.

					RAFE
			How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if
			you were the first man in the world to do
			it?

					DOOLITTLE
			Don't get smart with me, son.

					RAFE
			Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous
			only for the kind of pilot who wants to
			show off, rather than inspire the other
			pilots in his unit.  And all you've done
			for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I
			did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir.
			What the French call a "homage."

					DOOLITTLE
			That's bullshit, son.  But it's really
			good bullshit.

					RAFE
			Thank you, Sir.

	Doolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's
	hand.

					DOOLITTLE
			Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire
			your decision.

					RAFE
			Thank you, Sir.

	INT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - BARRACKS - NIGHT

	The pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town.
	Danny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on
	cologne, and looks terrific in his uniform.

	Anthony and Billy are combing their hair at the sinks.  Billy
	declares to his image in the mirror --

					BILLY
			You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you
			EVER die!

					ANTHONY
			That's your line for tonight, ya know.

					BILLY
			What, good-lookin' sumbitch?

					ANTHONY
			No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse
			alone, you look her in the eye, and say,
			"Baby, they're training me for war, and I
			don't know what'll happen.  But if I die
			tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all
			we could tonight."  I've never known it
			to fail.

	Red finishes brushing his teeth at the sink beside them.

					RED
			He's n-never known it to work, either.

	The guys head out laughing, running into Rafe coming in.

					DANNY
			Doolittle didn't kill you?  Attaboy!

	Rafe catches Danny's arm.

					RAFE
			Danny, there's something I gotta tell
			you...

	EXT.  NEW JERSEY BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny are walking on the parade ground; the other
	guys are already on the bus that will take them into town.
	Danny's upset by what Rafe just told him.

					DANNY
			How could you do this?

					RAFE
			The Colonel helped me work it out.

					DANNY
			I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork,
			I mean how the hell did you do it without
			letting me in on it?

					RAFE
			I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only
			accepting the best pilots.

					DANNY
			Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're
			talking about war, and I know what war
			does to people.

					RAFE
			Danny, you know how many times I saw you
			come to school with a black eye or a
			busted nose, and couldn't do a thing
			about it -- for you, or for your mother...
			or your father, with his lungs scorched
			out with mustard gas, and more left of
			his lungs than there was of his spirit?
			You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's
			time I made mine.

					BILLY
				(from the bus)
			The nurses are waiting!

					RAFE
			Let's go.

					DANNY
			Nah, you go on.

					RAFE
			I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you
			to meet her.

					DANNY
			Some other time.  I don't feel like a
			party.

	Danny walks away.  The bus driver's ready to leave, and Red
	is honking the horn for Rafe to come.  Rafe reluctantly lets
	Danny go, and heads for the bus, where the pilots are
	chanting --

					PILOTS VOICE
			Nurses!  Nurses!  Nurses!

	INT.  A MOVING TRAIN - DAY

	The trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats,
	shaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy
	section.  But the glow of the train is outshone by EVELYN
	STEWART.  She's one of ten young women, Army nurses, gathered
	at one end of the car as it rattles along the track.

	The other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too
	ripe.  Their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered,
	their spirits high.

	Evelyn listens in amusement to BETTY, a cute blonde with
	unmissable boobs, and BARBARA, a burnette equally endowed.

					BETTY
			Do you have trouble with your boobs in
			the uniform?

					BARBARA
			You mean hiding them?

					BETTY
			Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm
			talking about how you make them show!

	SANDRA, another nurse, speaks up.

					SANDRA
			Loan 'em to me, I'll make 'em show.

					BETTY
			The boobs or the pilots?

	The girls laugh and shove each others' knees; it's a party
	wherever they go.  But Evelyn can't keep her mind on the
	frivolity.  She looks out the window and her thoughts drift
	away.

					BARBARA
			We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!

					BETTY
			Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come
			on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want
			to know what we can expect.

	Suddenly all the girlish faces are looking at Evelyn.

					EVELYN
			I've been dating one pilot.  And only for
			a few weeks.  But I know he's different
			from all the others.

	Sandra throws up her arms and swoons onto her friends.

					SANDRA
			True love!...

					BETTY
			Morphine, give her morphine!

					BARBARA
			Give her an enema.

					EVELYN
			But I do have a warning for you.  There's
			one line you all need to know, and you're
			likely to hear it from any man in a
			uniform.  It goes like this:  "Honey,
			Baby... We never know what's gonna happen,
			and I may die tomorrow...so, let's live
			all we can tonight."

	A silence among the nurses.

					BARBARA
			I tell you.  Any one of those arrogant,
			leather-jacketed, slick-lookin' flyboys
			tries that line on me...he's gonna get
			anything he wants.

	As the nurses laugh --

	EXT.  NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	Our pilots -- indeed leather-jacketed and handsome -- are
	waiting on the platform.  Among then is Rafe, holding
	something behind his back, as the train pulls in and shudders
	to a stop, clouds of steam jetting onto the platform and
	giving the moment a dream-like haze.

	INT./ EXT.  TRAIN - NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	The nurses start stepping out; both pilots and nurses pretend
	surprise to see each.  At the door of the train, Evelyn
	whispers to Betty --

					EVELYN
			Stick with me, I'll find you somebody
			good.

	Betty spot's Rafe.

					BETTY
			I'll take that one.

					EVELYN
			He's taken.  But come on, I'll introduce
			you.

	They move to Rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his
	eyes holding Evelyn.

					RAFE
			Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.

					EVELYN
			You too, Lieutenant.

	Betty clears her throat.

					EVELYN
			Oh, this is Betty.

					RAFE
			Nice to meet you, Betty.

	He draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two
	roses.  He hands one to Evelyn and the second to Betty.

					RAFE
			Danny would'a brought this.

	He escorts them along the platform.

					EVELYN
			Danny's not coming?

					RAFE
			No, he...got some news today.  He'll be
			okay, he just didn't feel like coming
			tonight.

					EVELYN
			I was hoping to meet him.

					BETTY
			I was hoping to meet him.

					RAFE
			We'll just have to find a substitute,
			won't we?

	Betty stops, and faces Rafe.

					BETTY
			I just want to tell you one thing.  If
			you're thinking this might be your last
			night on earth?... I'm prepared to make
			it meaningful.
				(leaning close)
			Very meaningful.

					EVELYN
			At ease, Betty!

	INT.  CITY NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

	It's a party in full swing; swing music, jitterbugging,
	beautiful young men and women in high spirits.

	Rafe and Evelyn are sitting at a big table with the other
	pilots and nurses.  Anthony's paired up with Sandra, Billy
	with Barbara, and Red, shyest of the group, finds himself
	next to Betty.  Betty's already found a companion in Red
	Strange.

					RED
			He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.

					BETTY
			Red...Strange?

					RED
			You know the football player, Red G-
			Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red,
			cause you know, I'm red...and they
			thought I was strange, so, you know, Red
			G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.

					BETTY
			But...they called you Strange?  Because
			of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red
			Grange strange?

					RED
			How would I know.

	Beside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and
	swigs from that.  Rafe and Evelyn see this, and try to keep
	from laughing.

					BETTY
			Do you always stutter?

					RED
			Only when I'm n-n-n-

					BETTY
			Nervous?

					RED
			Yeah.  But if I have to get something
			out, I c-can always s-s-s-
				(he sings)
			SIIING!

	She covers his hand with hers.

					BETTY
			Don't be nervous.

	Red looks at Betty with love in his eyes.  Under the table,
	Rafe and Evelyn join hands too.

					EVELYN
			There shipping us out.  Hawaii.  The
			Germans are overrunning Europe, and we're
			sent to paradise.  How about you?  Have
			you heard anything?

	He hesitates; then Evelyn is distracted by the conversation
	beside them, between Barbara and Billy.

					BILLY
			You're a very special woman, and...well
			baby, they're training me for war, and we
			don't know what happens tomorrow.  So we
			gotta make tonight special.

	Barbara shoots a look at Evelyn, before she answers.

					BARBARA
			I hope you can back that up, flyboy.
			Cause you're not ever gonna forget
			tonight.

	She takes him by the hand and pulls him to his feet... They
	start dancing, sexy movements that won't stop till they've
	been in bed.

	Rafe pulls Evelyn to her feet, and leads her through the
	dancers, outside.

	EXT.  THE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

	They find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the
	river, and Manhattan beyond.  Evelyn takes in the view,
	breathes in the air; she still holds the rose.

					EVELYN
			Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't
			good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard
			to say.

					RAFE
			The only reason it's hard to say is that
			I keep thinking I don't have the right to
			say it.  But I've got to because it's
			true.  I love you.
				(beat)
			That must surprise you.

					EVELYN
			It surprises me that I'm not the only one
			on this balcony who feels that way.

	The power of hearing this from each other grips them both.

					RAFE
			There's one thing I have to say.  I'm
			going away.

					EVELYN
			We're all going away.

					RAFE
			I'm going to the war.  The real war.
			Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are
			hanging on by their fingernails, and If
			they lose, there'll be more people killed
			than anybody can imagine.  And not just
			there, but here.

					EVELYN
			But you're in the U.S. Army, how could
			you --

					RAFE
			Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and
			put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need
			pilots, and we need experience.  I leave
			tomorrow.

					EVELYN
			You waited til tonight to tell me?

					RAFE
			I had to tell you in person.  Because
			there's something else I need to say.

	He studies her face, burning it into his memory.

					RAFE
			Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make
			tonight memorable.  What I feel about you
			makes it impossible for me to say
			something like that.  If I don't come
			back, I don't want to saddle you with
			regret and sadness you'll carry the rest
			of your life.

					EVELYN
			I don't know if you can choose that,
			Rafe.

					RAFE
			Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I
			love you.  And I will come back.  I'll
			find a way.  And then we'll get a chance
			to know if what I felt the first moment I
			saw you, and every minute since then, is
			real.

					EVELYN
			Do one thing for me, before you go.

	She takes his hand and leads him inside.

	INT.  NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

	She leads him onto the dance floor, and they dance, among the
	others, yet in a world apart from everyone else.  And then
	they stop while all the others move around them, and kiss the
	kind of kiss that lasts a lifetime.

	EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

	The nurses are entering the hotel.  Pilots are going in with
	them.  But Rafe and Evelyn stop on the street.

	A last kiss.  Their hands touch a final time, and then part.
	She moves inside the lobby, and looks out the glass doors as
	he walks away.

	EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN

	Rafe and Danny stand on the platform.  Rafe's got his gear
	packed in a bag slung over his shoulder.

					CONDUCTOR'S VOICE
			All aboard!

	Rafe glances once more toward the revolving doors from the
	station that lead onto the platform.

					DANNY
			Didn't you say you told her not to come?

					RAFE
			Yeah.

					DANNY
			Then why are you looking for her?

					RAFE
			It's a test.  If I asked her to come and
			she came, it wouldn't tell me anything.
			If I tell her not to come, and she
			comes...then I know she loves me.

					VOICE
			ALL ABOARD!

					DANNY
			You're still a kid, ya know that?  Take
			care of yourself.

					RAFE
			You too.

	Rafe sticks his hand out to Danny.  Danny knocks it away, and
	hugs him.

	Rafe steps onto the train, and it pulls away.  Rafe waves.
	Danny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer...

					DANNY
			Give 'em hell, Rafe.

	INT.  TRAIN - DAWN

	Rafe finds a seat and sits down.  He's the only one in the
	car, and he's deeply alone.

	EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN

	Danny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the
	station.  He takes the one on the far right.  As he passes
	through it, he doesn't see Evelyn rushing through the door on
	the left side.  She's told herself she wouldn't come, but
	couldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the
	train disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits
	her.

	She stands on the empty platform, as lonely as Rafe.

	MONTAGE - THE JOURNEYS

	Rafe and Evelyn travel in opposite directions, toward
	opposite ends of the earth...

	EXT.  A GRAY, COLD, CANADIAN SEAPORT - DAY

	as Rafe boards a Canadian naval vessel headed into the North
	Atlantic.

	EXT.  TRAIN - TRAVELING THROUGH THE AMERICAN WEST - DAY

	Evelyn and her fellow nurses ride the train through the
	American southwest.  The scenery outside the window is
	beautiful, but her thoughts are far away...

	EXT.  NORTH ATLANTIC - DAY

	Rafe's ship is in a convoy through the rough gray waters.
	The deck is loaded with military supplies bound for Britain.
	Rafe stands among the drab crates and seems oblivious to the
	rain, his thoughts on Evelyn.

	He looks toward the eastern horizon, where his ship is
	heading.  A deep, dark storm is brewing before them...

	EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

	Evelyn stands on the deck of a ship headed in the opposite
	direction, on another ocean, the sky is clear, the breeze is
	warm, the light of a glowing sunset bathes her face.  The
	MONTAGE ENDS, with them heading to different ends of the
	earth.

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DUSK

	In the eternal dusk of England, everything is cold and gray.
	British fighter planes -- Spitfires and Hurricanes -- are
	surrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled
	fuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines.
	Rafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag.
	He moves up behind a slim, pale BRITISH AIR COMMANDER who is
	surveying engine damage on one of the Spitfires.

					RAFE
			Rafe McCawley, Sir.

	Rafe salutes as the Air Commander turns and then returns the
	salute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone.  Rafe
	freezes at the sight, reminded of Danny's father.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?

					RAFE
			That's me, Sir.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll
			get you situated in some quarters, and
			then introduce you to the equipment
			you'll be flying.

					RAFE
			If you're patching up bullet holes right
			here on the runway, maybe we should skip
			the housekeeping and get right to the
			planes.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are
			to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?

					RAFE
			Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to
			matter.

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY

	A Spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a
	string of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a
	shot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood
	still splattered over the inside of the cockpit.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Good lad.  Didn't die till he'd landed
			and shut down his engine.  Welcome to the
			war.

	He walks away, leaving Rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - MILITARY BASE - DAY

	Evelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps.
	As they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially
	Evelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other --

					GUARD
			I've died and gone to heaven.

	The guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses.  The jeeps
	drive through.  The nurses are loving this island paradise
	already.

					BARBARA
			You know the ratio of men to women on
			this island?  Four-thousand...to one.

	Barbara slides on a new pair of sunglasses with plastic palm
	trees glued on the sides, and calls back to the guards as the
	jeeps pull away --

					BARBARA
			See ya on the beach, boys!

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE - NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - DAY

	As the other nurses happily unpack, Evelyn leaves and crosses
	the grass in the drenching sunshine.  We follow her into --

	INT.  BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	She finds a small, immaculately clean hospital, twenty beds
	with luminous white sheets, all empty.

	Then she notices the view.  It's of Pearl Harbor, with the
	entire American Pacific fleet riding at anchor.  Battleships
	all in a row.  Aircraft carriers too, in perfect stillness on
	the aqua blue water with a white sand bottom.  The view is
	expansive and beautiful.

	The sound of an approaching fighter plane with wing guns
	firing as we --

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  THE DARK SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

	Rafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his
	Spitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again
	into a squadron of Messerschmidts; they outnumber the British
	planes, and they're tougher and faster.  Rafe darts through
	their line, machine guns blazing.

	One of the Spitfires in Rafe's squadron has taken hits in the
	engine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its
	pilot, NIGEL, frantic as the German planes swarm into finish
	him.

					BRITISH PILOT (NIGEL)
			I need help!  Someone get them off me!

	Rafe slams his control stick hard right and goes into a power
	dive at one of the Messerschmidts.  Rafe's bullets chew up
	its cockpit and the plane goes into a fast corkscrew spiral,
	down into the water.

	Rafe instantly climbs again.  Nigel, in the moment of safety
	Rafe has bought him, bails out, his chute blossoming and
	carrying him toward the water.  The OTHER BRITISH PILOTS are
	impressed.

					OTHER BRITISH PILOT
				(into radio)
			Nigel's out!  I'll call in the position!
				(to himself)
			That Yank is bloody good.

	Rafe swings his plane right back at the Germans; he attacks
	them head on, just like he went at Danny, only this time he's
	firing his machine guns.

	And OVER THIS ferocious dogfight, we hear his letter to
	Evelyn...

					RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
			Dear Evelyn... It is cold here.  So cold,
			in a way that goes deep into your bones.

	The Messerschmidt in Rafe's sights breaks apart with the
	stream of precise fire he pours into it, its prop flying into
	pieces, its disintegration accelerated by its airspeed.
	Before it completely comes apart, it explodes.

	Rafe goes into another tight turn, to get at them again.

					RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
			It's not easy making friends.  Two nights
			ago I drank a beer with a couple of the
			R.A.F. pilots -- beer's the only thing
			here that isn't cold -- and yesterday both
			of them got killed...

	As Rafe starts another attack we see him in the cockpit, in
	the trance of battle, as other Spitfires around him are
	getting shot out of the sky...as we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Evelyn, receiving the letter at mail call.

	She sits on the grass under a palm tree, in paradise, reading
	his letter.

					RAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
			There is one place I can go to find
			warmth, and that is to think of you.

	EXT.  OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - OAHU - DAY

	Evelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress.  She's
	let her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat
	in the tropical heat.

	The restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood
	posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor.
	Evelyn sits alone.  She's brought writing paper.  As the
	Hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with
	chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at
	the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen.

	But before she can start to write, three naval officers move
	over to her table from the bar.  They're out of uniform too,
	wearing garish tropical shirts.

					NAVY GUY 1
			A woman beautiful as you shouldn't be
			sitting alone.  Buy you a drink?

					EVELYN
			Thank you...Ensign.

	The guys look at each other, impressed that she could tell.

					NAVY GUY 1
			Ensign!  Smart too!

					NAVY GUY 2
			So how about that drink?  Or dinner?

					EVELYN
			Thank you, but...I really want to be
			alone right now.

					NAVY GUY 3
			Want to see something long and hard?

	He shows her the tattoo of an anchor on his forearm.  Evelyn
	looks away from them, toward the harbor.

					EVELYN
			I'm sorry.  I've got a letter to write.

					NAVY GUY 3
			Cold bitch.

	His friends start to pull him away, but Evelyn's eyes flare.

					EVELYN
			What did you say?

					NAVY GUY 3
			I said you're cold.

					EVELYN
			Cold?  No, I'm just thinking about a war.
			And maybe you should be too.

	They leave, shaking their heads.  Evelyn picks up her pen,
	and writes.

					EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)
			Dear Rafe... It's strange to be so far
			from you in body, and so close to you in
			spirit.  But if our spirits really give
			our bodies life, then you should know
			this:  Every night I look at the sunset,
			and try to draw the last ounce of heat
			from its long day...

	She looks toward the sunset now; then she writes again...

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - NIGHT

	Rafe brings his battered plane in for a landing...

	INT.  BRITISH AIRFIELD BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Rafe sits on his cot, reading her letter.

					EVELYN'S VOICE (LETTER)
			...and send it from my heart to yours.

	Rafe is startled as the Air Commander appears beside his
	bunk.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Air-Sea Rescue picked up Nigel.  He'll be
			back with us tomorrow.

	Rafe nods, glad to hear the news.  The Commander starts to
	walk away, then turns back.

					BRITISH AIR COMMANDER
			Some of us look down on the Yanks for not
			yet joining this war.  I'd just like to
			say that if there are many more back home
			like you, God help anyone who goes to war
			with America.

	The Commander salutes, with his left hand.  And Rafe salutes
	too -- with his left hand.

	EXT.  ESTABLISHING THE WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

	The White House looks somehow whiter and purer in the glow of
	1941.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	GENERALS, ADMIRALS, and other advisors sit around the
	polished table -- all males, in suits and in uniforms.  The
	door opens, and the men all stand.

	PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT appears, in a wheelchair, pushed
	by a huge black valet, GEORGE.  The President's legs are
	shriveled, braced with the iron supports that attach to his
	shoes and are apparent beneath the cloth of his pin-striped
	pants.  From the waist up Roosevelt is heavily muscled,
	powerful, and handsome even in his little spectacles.  The
	valet rolls him to the head of the table; he's speaking even
	before he settles in.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Please be seated, gentlemen.

	They sit, as one.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Churchill and Stalin are asking me what
			I'm asking you:  How long is America
			going to pretend the world is not at war?

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			We've increased supply shipments to them,
			Mr. President, and we're losing merchant
			vessels every day.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Shift in every destroyer and anti-
			aircraft weapon you can find.

					ADMIRAL
			Sir, our Pacific Fleet is already down
			to almost nothing.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Gentlemen, at this moment the nation of
			Hungry has a larger military then the
			United States.  We have no choice but to
			draw from whatever we can.

	EXT.  ESTABLISHING TOKYO - JAPAN - NIGHT

	INT.  JAPANESE HIGH COMMAND - NIGHT

	The Conference Room is similar to that of the White House.
	But this table is low and all the men sit on the floor.  And
	there are no civilians here; Japan is now a nation ruled by
	its warriors.

	The last man to enter the room and take his place is ADMIRAL
	YAMAMOTO.  Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of
	veneration and suspicion among the men of the war council.
	Yamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend
	Genda, who can't hide his fear.  Yamamoto glances to the far
	end of the table where NISHIKURA, chief of the War Council,
	sits glowering.  (Their discussion is in Japanese, with
	subtitles.)

					NISHIKURA
			So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us
			thought your education at an American
			university would make you too weak to
			fight the Americans.

					YAMAMOTO
			If knowledge of opponents and careful
			calculation of danger is taken as
			weakness then I have misunderstood what
			it means to be Japanese.

					NISHIKURA
			The time has come to strike!  Or to sit
			and let the Americans cut off our oil and
			our future.  I know what you whisper to
			the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans
			are strong.  Yet look at their leader.

	He motions to OYAMA, an intelligence analyst, who opens a
	file and lays out pictures of Roosevelt.

					OYAMA
			Franklin Roosevelt.  Born into great
			wealth.  Fifteen years ago, he was
			stricken with polio.  Now he cannot walk,
			or even stand without help.
			Photographers will not take pictures of
			him in his chair; Americans do not wish
			to know how weak their President is.

	Yamamoto makes a low grunt.

					NISHIKURA
			You have something to say, Yamamoto?

					YAMAMOTO
			The Council knows I have opposed fighting
			the Americans.  No matter how great our
			resolve, they have resources beyond ours.
			If we must go to war, there is only one
			way -- deal them a blow from which it will
			take them years to recover.  In that time
			we can conquer all of the Pacific, and
			they will have no choice but to ask for
			peace.

					NISHIKURA
			You see us as capable of such a blow?

					YAMAMOTO
			The Americans themselves have made it
			possible.  We will annihilate them in a
			single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

	The members of the war council are so pleased with Yamamoto
	that they bow to him.  Only Genda keeps his eyes raised long
	enough to see the sadness in Yamamoto's face.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AIR BASE - BARRACKS - DAY

	Danny Walker and his pilot buddies have just arrived; they
	enter the barracks, talking happily.

					RED
			If I ain't n-never on a b-boat again,
			it'll be too s-soon.

					BILLY
			Where are the women on this --

	Danny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that
	the other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their
	beds, sleeping off hangovers.  They wear Hawaiian shirts;
	they haven't shaved.

					RED
			They're s-still asleep!

	Danny pauses for a moment, then shouts --

					DANNY
			Drop your cocks and grab your socks,
			boys!  The terror of the skies are here!

	The sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their
	pillows.

					ANTHONY
			They're all drunk.

	One guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of
	the compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible
	taste from his mouth.  As his feet dangle over the side of
	the bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation
	reaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its
	bottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he
	blinks as if trying to remember how it got there.

	Danny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name, COMA.

					DANNY
			Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.

					COMA
			Where's that lizard?

					DANNY
			What lizard?

					COMA
			The one that slept in my mouth last
			night.

					DANNY
			What the hell happened to you guys?

	Coma is one of those drunks who speak as if he's always about
	to burp.

					COMA
			Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a
			big...pot.  Like...like...

					RED
			A m-missionary?

					COMA
			No, like...

	Coma emits a pukey, toxic burp that has Danny and his buddies
	wincing back from the fumes.

					DANNY
			This is an Air Base?  Where's your squad
			commander?

	The question soaks through to Coma's brain.  His right hand
	points...and his left hand points...in different directions.
	His hands float around in the air until finally both of them
	are indicating the same direction, behind his back.  In the
	bunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian
	shirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that
	protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him
	too.

	Danny and his buddies are speechless -- except for Red
	Strange.

					RED
			I th-think I'm gonna like it here.

					COMA
			You guys are new?

					DANNY
			Yeah.

					COMA
			Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about
			mai-tai's.

	Coma's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment
	he's looking for something under the bed.  Then he pukes.
	Danny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the
	barracks; his friends follow.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AIRFIELD - DAY

	Danny and his buddies stride up to the airfield.  It's full
	of fighter planes -- and they're all bunched together in
	clusters on the field.  Danny grabs a MECHANIC.

					DANNY
			Hey!  What is this, the planes all
			bunched up like that?

					MECHANIC
			The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This
			makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier
			to service.

					DANNY
			What about easier to hit in an air raid?

					MECHANIC
			Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four
			thousand miles away.  So you guys just
			arrived, huh?

					DANNY
			Yeah.

					MECHANIC
			We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!

	The mechanic walks off.  Danny and the guys are left standing
	on the tarmac.

					DANNY
			Well guys...I reckon there's just one
			thing to do...

	INT.  OAHU BAR - DAY

	Danny and the pilots are in Hawaiian shirts, their party in
	full swing.  A bucket-sized hollowed-out volcano sits in the
	middle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the
	crater.  It's full of booze -- or was; Danny and the other
	guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as
	the last liquid is sucked dry.

					RED
			More m-mai-tai's!

	Coma is sitting there with them, beside Red.

					COMA
			Absolutely right.

	Everybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in
	with the others.  Danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his
	own thoughts.  Billy and Anthony are doing the hula to the
	Hawaiian music playing.

					COMA
			No, you guys aren't doing it right.  It's
			in the hands.  They talk story.

	Coma stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures
	of his hula.

					COMA
			Fish swim in ocean... Happy in the Mother
			Sea... Girl, beautiful girl, with big
			jugs, walks into water...waves lapping at
			her thighs...

					ANTHONY
			I never knew those dances were so
			sophisticated.

					COMA
			...Fish nibble at her breasts...

	Coma's really into his dance, his hands over enormous
	imaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows --

					COMA
			A more beautiful girl walks by...

	The guys see Evelyn passing on the other side of the street,
	gorgeous in the sunshine.  Coma's hands start squeezing the
	imaginary breasts of his hula.

					BILLY
			Hey, isn't that Evelyn?

	Danny moves up to look.

					DANNY
			Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

					COMA
			You guys know her?!  I gotta have an
			intro!  Man, I'd like to --

	Danny's hand is suddenly around Coma's larynx.

					DANNY
			A friend of mine's in love with her.  So
			you don't even look -- not ever.

	Danny releases him and Coma staggers back to the table to
	nuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano.

	Danny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beautiful
	form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base
	hospital.  Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly
	Hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto
	the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full
	of the potent liquid.  He shouts to the whole room --

					DANNY
			I'm a better pilot than any son-of-a-
			bitch on this island!  So I'm the one to
			say this!  Here's to Rafe McCawley!  A
			better pilot...and a better man...than
			me.

	The other pilots drink up -- from glasses or from straws.

					OTHER PILOTS
			To Rafe.

	Danny drains the whole glass at one chug, and slams it down
	onto the table.  Then he blinks, puts a hand on his stomach,
	and frowns.  Coma recognizes the look.

					COMA
			Uh oh.  Volcanic eruption!

	Danny bends at the waist; his head obscured by the table.

					COMA
			Shit, he's puking on my feet!

					RED
			Well, you p-puked on his feet.

					COMA
			Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!

	INT.  ADMIRAL KIMMEL'S OFFICE - OAHU - DAY

	ADMIRAL KIMMEL is Commander of the American Pacific Fleet.

	Two members of his staff are standing uncomfortably in front
	of him, having delivered a message from the Joint Chiefs of
	Staff.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			...transfer twelve more destroyers to
			Atlantic Fleet, and all the available
			anti-aircraft weaponry?!  Washington has
			gone insane!

	Kimmel's STRATEGIC ANALYST speaks up.

					STRATEGIC ANALYST
			We've done what you ordered, Admiral, and
			war gamed the likely outcome of a
			Japanese attack against each of our major
			bases in the Pacific.  Wake, Guam,
			Midway, the Philippines.  In each case,
			we lose.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			You left out Hawaii.

					STRATEGIC ANALYST
			Pearl Harbor can't be attacked
			effectively from the air.  It's too
			shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.
			Pearl Harbor's safe.  It's everywhere
			else that we're vulnerable.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			Step up surveillance of Japanese
			communications.  They're gonna do
			something somewhere.  I can feel it.

	EXT.  THE SKIES ABOVE OAHU - DAY

	A seaplane takes tourists on an excursion above Pearl Harbor
	and around the island of Oahu.  One Japanese tourist shoots
	pictures rapidly...first of the ships as seen from overhead;
	then he leans to the other side of the plane and shoots
	pictures of the airfield below them.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Another Japanese tourist hikes through the hills above Pearl
	Harbor.  He takes an excellent camera from his picnic basket,
	and shoots pictures.

	CLOSE - THE PICTURES, being carried down a hallway, into --

	INT.  JAPANESE PLANNERS OFFICE - DAY

	The courier places the pictures onto the table in front of
	Yamamoto, Genda, and the other JAPANESE OFFICERS.

					GENDA
			Look at the ships -- all grouped.  Perfect
			targets!

					JAPANESE OFFICER
			And the planes!  They are -- what is that
			American expression?  Sitting geese?

					YAMAMOTO
			Sitting ducks.

					JAPANESE OFFICER
			How can they be so foolish?

					YAMAMOTO
			They think no one would be stupid enough
			to attack them at Pearl Harbor.

					GENDA
			Or perhaps they think no one is capable.
			Look at this...

	He moves to a diagram displayed on the wall -- a simple
	display showing water depth and ship displacement.

					GENDA
			Pearl Harbor's depth of only forty feet
			makes them feel safe.  A torpedo dropped
			from an airplane plunges to one hundred
			feet before it can level off.  That is a
			conventional torpedo.  But we have been
			experimenting.

	From a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden
	fins, attached to a circular metallic band.

					GENDA
			Wooden fins.  We are testing them
			tomorrow.

	EXT.  JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY

	Yamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet Japanese
	island, sunlit and pleasant.  They are gathered on the shore
	of the island's natural harbor.  Wooden targets -- basically
	huge plank barriers -- are sunk into the water like ships at
	anchor.  A squadron of Japanese planes zooms overhead, taking
	up attack positions.

					GENDA
			We have chosen this place because its
			depth is exactly the same as Pearl
			Harbor's.

	Genda speaks into a field radio.  A lone plane drops out of
	formation and goes into a low-level approach, speeding up and
	dropping its torpedo.

	BELOW THE SURFACE we see the torpedo as it plunges at two
	hundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea.  With the wooden
	fins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the
	sea floor.

	ABOVE THE SURFACE the planners see the path of the torpedo;
	it hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying THUNK.  The
	planners are impressed -- but Yamamoto is not satisfied.

					YAMAMOTO
			Uncharged torpedoes have different
			balance.

					GENDA
			I have arranged a live fire drill -- with
			your permission.

	Yamamoto nods; Genda speaks again into his radio, and another
	plane swoops down and drops a torpedo.  Genda holds his hands
	to his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though
	they wonder at the need.

	The torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening,
	and of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to
	toothpicks.

					GENDA
			Of course against a ship the explosion
			will not be dissipated, and will have
			more force.

	The planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they
	knew that all the time.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE - PILOTS' BARRACKS - NIGHT

	The pilots are getting slicked up.

					BILLY
			Are you sure they're here?

					ANTHONY
			If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!

	Red moves up beside him to frown at the mirror.  His hair is
	plastered down and parted, his uniform's immaculate.

					ANTHONY
			Looking good, Red.

					RED
			Shut up.

	Red moves away, to polish his shoes.

					ANTHONY
			What is it with Red?  I've never seen him
			this way.

					BILLY
			He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny,
			you coming?

					DANNY
			Nah, I'm gonna stay here.  Read.

	Anthony and Billy look at each other; Danny's in his bunk,
	and he's not reading, just staring at the ceiling.

	INT.  NURSES' BARRACKS - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	The nurses are primping to go out; Evelyn is in her uniform
	getting ready to go back to work.

					BARBARA
			Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I
			mean, you can put your hands on him if
			you want to, but then my hands will break
			yours.

					BETTY
			He was that good?

					BARBARA
			No, I was.

	EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - NIGHT

	Creeping through the vegetation, Red leads Anthony and Billy
	to a spot outside the nurses' barracks; they can see the
	girls through the barracks window.

					BILLY
			Red, Peeping Tom stuff can get us court-
			marshaled.

					RED
			Shhh!

	Anthony and Billy are baffled, even more so when Red strides
	into the open, right outside the nurses' window.

	And then, Red begins to sing.

					RED
				(singing)
			Oh...Betty, Betty, Betty, you're the one
			for me, Betty, Betty, Betty, Betty, can't
			you see...

	Anthony and Billy look at each other, dumbfounded.  The
	nurses move to the open windows.  Red's singing is pretty
	good -- though not that good.  But he doesn't stutter when he
	sings.

					RED
				(singing)
			I'll be yours for eternity, Betty, Betty,
			Betty, Betty, Betty!

	Anthony and Billy are hysterical, trying to keep their
	laughter hidden.  But then they see the effect this is having
	on the women -- especially on Betty.  She's smitten.

	Red repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he
	finishes, Betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses
	applaud.  They move off into the darkness, arm and arm.

	The nurses go back to their primping.

	Anthony and Billy are changed men.  Anthony stands up;
	Billy's baffled.  Anthony moves out and starts singing.

					ANTHONY
				(singing)
			Oh Sandra...I like you...love you...

	He's terrible.  The nurses pelt him with hairbrushes,
	curlers, shoes...

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY

	Coming out of the blustery skies at the end of another deadly
	day, a squadron of Spitfires chirps in for landings.  The
	planes are shot up and battered.

	Rafe is one of the pilots; the fuselage below his cockpit is
	marked with four swastikas, symbols of his victories.  He
	taxis to a stop, and is met by IAN, a Scottish mechanic, who
	is dismayed at the state of the plane.

					IAN
			Leapin' Jesus!

					RAFE
				(climbing down)
			The struts are loose, the hydraulics are
			leaking, and the electrical system's
			shorting out in the cockpit.

					IAN
			Well which of those three ya want fixed?

					RAFE
			All of 'em.

	Rafe starts away, and Ian calls to his back --

					IAN
			If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya
			should'a stayed in the bloody States!

					RAFE
			And if you don't give me a plane that can
			handle combat, you better start learning
			to speak German.

					IAN
			Fook ya!

					RAFE
			Learn English, then!

					IAN
			Fook ya dooble!

	Rafe moves to the barracks; Ian keeps the fueling hose going,
	and moves to help the armorers reload the guns.

	INT.  BRITISH AIRFIELD BARRACKS - NIGHT

	Rafe falls down onto his cot, exhausted.  The other pilots do
	the same, everybody spent from the day's combat.  Then they
	hear the SIREN.  Rafe's out of his bunk, with the others,
	everybody running.

					BRITISH PILOT
			Bloody Krauts!  Night raid!

	EXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - NIGHT

	They race across the runway.  Rafe reaches his Spitfire, just
	as Ian is removing the fueling hose.

					IAN
			I have'na been able ta --

					RAFE
			Crank her!

	Ian gives the prop a spin, and the engine roars to life.

					IAN
			God speed ya, laddie.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - NIGHT

	It's dark, but there are breaks in the clouds, giving way to
	patches of light from a full moon.  The squadron of Spitfires
	tightens up for battle.

	Rafe is positioned just right of the squad leader; he sees
	planes breaking out of the dark clouds ahead.

					RAFE
			Here they come.

	The clouds break, revealing a huge attack formation.

					BRITISH SQUAD LEADER
			Alpha group, on the bombers!  Beta group,
			take the fighters!

	They peel off, into action.

	EXT.  THE AIR BATTLE OVER THE CHANNEL - NIGHT

	We stay with Rafe as he and the Squad Leader rush side by
	side at the lead bomber, blasting away with their guns.

	INT.  GERMAN BOMBER - IN THE AIR - NIGHT

	The Spitfires' bullets rip into the pilot and also kill the
	nose gunner; the bomber dips as the copilot struggles to take
	control.

	INT.  RAFE, IN HIS SPITFIRE - NIGHT

	As he streaks past, Rafe sees the bomber wobble in the air.

					RAFE
			We've got him hurt, stay on him!

	Rafe throws his plane into an ultra-tight, high speed turn,
	right between the tails of the leader German group and the
	noses of the second.  His turn is so tight that the plane
	flexes with the g-force.

	Rafe comes out of his turn ahead of the Squad Leader, and
	races back up through the formation of German bombers, moving
	above them where their weapons and armaments are the weakest.
	He stitches a trail of bullets from tail to nose of the
	wounded lead bomber; it begins to smoke.

	The second Spitfire, the Squad Leader's, takes fire from the
	other German bombers, and shears off, heading through the
	smoke of the plane Rafe has on the ropes.

					RAFE
			We've got him going!

	Rafe does a half-loop and half-spin, to bring him around to
	face the bombers again.  This time the g-force of the turn
	pops an oil line inside Rafe's cockpit; hot, pressurized oil
	begins to spray everywhere -- all over Rafe, his controls,
	and worst of all, over the inside of his cockpit glass.

	He wipes at the oil with his hands and that just smears it
	and makes it worse.

	His wingman sees him veering away from the bombers...and sees
	the German fighters moving up to meet him.

					SQUAD LEADER
			McCawley!  Get to the clouds!  Get into
			the clouds!

	RAFE, IN HIS PLANE, is flying blind.

					RAFE
			I can't see the clouds!

	His problems are just beginning; the fluid is dripping down
	onto his cockpit's corroded electrical wiring; the fluid
	causes an arc...a spark...and suddenly a fire is spreading
	through Rafe's plane.

	He grabs his fire extinguisher and triggers a cloud that
	snuffs the fire but fills the entire cockpit with choking
	smoke; between that and the smeared fluid on his glass, he
	can't see a thing.

	And the Messerschmidts are swarming over him.

	Rafe's wingman dives in, raking the German planes as he
	passes.

	Rafe tries to open his cockpit cover to clear the smoke, but
	it's jammed; he pulls out his .45 pistol and BLAM!  BLAM!
	BLAM!  He blows out the glass; the smoke clears enough for
	him to take a breath and try to see.  He fights the stick,
	but the plane won't respond.

	The Messerschmidts rake him again, bullets riddling his
	engine.

					SQUAD LEADER
			Get out of there, McCawley!  Get out of
			there!

	Rafe's plane descends, ever faster, passing through clouds,
	then clear air again.  The Squad Leader tries to chase and
	cover him, but Rafe's dropping fast, and still isn't out of
	the plane as the Germans dive on him again, firing.

	Rafe's Spitfire hits the broken fog over the water -- the
	Squad Leader loses sight of it for a moment -- and then the
	plane hits, splashing and exploding all at once.

	The Squad Leader winces, and ducks into the clouds as he
	reports on his radio...

					SQUAD LEADER
			McCawley down.  No 'chute.

	EXT.  BATTLESHIP WEST VIRGINIA - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The sailors have assembled on deck for the ship's heavyweight
	championship fight, a contest made more interesting to the
	sailors because one of the combatants is white and the other
	is black.

	The battle is more toughness than technique.  The guys
	throwing haymakers and shoving each other around the roped
	area, as their shipmates cheer and make wild bets.  The white
	guy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the
	black guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's
	belly, making him back up and say --

					WHITE BOXER
			You hit hard -- for a cook.

	The black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right
	cross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a
	fresh cut over his right eye.  The white guy now rushes in,
	and the black guy (his name is DORIE MILLER) throws an upper
	cut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks.

	The sailors cheer wildly.  Dorie steps back, and rubs his
	glove across his brow.  It's really bleeding now.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE - DAY

	Evelyn is returning from church with six of her nurse
	friends.  It's very quiet on a Sunday morning, almost nobody
	at the base; they walk along the path.

					BARBARA
			Let's get into civvies and find a bar.

					MARTHA
			Right after church?

					BARBARA
			You've gotta sin some, to get
			forgiveness.  Come with us, Evelyn.  You
			need some sin.

					EVELYN
			I've got to write some requisitions.
			We're undersupplied with morphine.

					BETTY
			Morphine?  We've been here a month and
			nobody's had worse than a sunburn.

	Evelyn smiles softly and walks toward the base hospital.

					BETTY
			I wish she could forget him.

					BARBARA
			You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Evelyn approaches the hospital and finds the black boxer
	peering in the window.  He's in a T-shirt and navy pants.

					EVELYN
			Can I help you, sailor?

	As Dorie turns, she sees the cut on his head, closed only
	with a band-aid; it's dripping blood down his T-shirt.

					DORIE
			'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors
			is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to
			look at this.

					EVELYN
			Our doctor's gone too.

					DORIE
			Sorry to trouble you.

					EVELYN
			Wait, let me look at that... You better
			come in here.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	Miller is sitting on a stool; Evelyn bathes the wound.

					EVELYN
			How'd you get this?

					DORIE
			Boxin'.

					EVELYN
			Win?

					DORIE
			Yes'm.

	He says it without pride.  She puts down the basin.

					EVELYN
			What's your name?

					DORIE
			Dorie Miller, 'Mam.

					EVELYN
			I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But
			I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs
			sewing, or else it's gonna make a big
			lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - LATER

	Evelyn clips the ends of her carefully applied stitches;
	Dorie's eyes are rolled up as if he could watch from inside
	his skull.

					EVELYN
			How often you fight like this?

					DORIE
			Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight
			champion of the West Virginia.

					EVELYN
			What do you get for winning?

					DORIE
			Respect.

	She hands him a mirror.  He studies her work.

					DORIE
			No doctor would'a give me that good.

	She walks him to the door.

					DORIE
			Thank you, 'Mam.

					EVELYN
			Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big
			as you -- and smart too, you knew where
			to come when your ship couldn't help --
			do you still have to fight with your
			fists to get respect?

					DORIE
			I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be
			a man.  They made me a cook -- and not
			even that, really -- I clean up after the
			other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's
			shoes.  In two years, they've never even
			let me fire a gun.

	Now Evelyn understands.

					EVELYN
			You take care, Dorie.

					DORIE
			You too, 'Mam.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - SUNSET

	Dorie walks away, down the path between the palm trees.  She
	watches him go, and then is transfixed by someone else
	coming, silhouetted by the light of the setting sun.  She
	can't make out his face, but he's wearing a pilot's dress
	uniform, and coming to her right out of the warm orange
	sunset that she has stared at so many times.  Her heart slams
	against her ribs; she takes a few steps forward.

					EVELYN
			...Rafe...

	She moves toward him, and he draws near her, walking slowly.
	And then she sees his face...

	It's Danny.  His face as sad as death itself.

	And even before he tells her, she knows.

					DANNY
			Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe
			McCawley's best friend.

					EVELYN
			Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were.
			Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's
			why you've come.

	EXT.  A BENCH - OVERLOOKING PEARL HARBOR - SUNSET

	Evelyn and Danny sit on the bench, with a sweeping view of
	the harbor and the lights winking on all around it as the sun
	settles beyond the horizon.  Evelyn is stoic, numb; Danny is
	the one who is struggling.

					DANNY
			Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the
			one to tell you, if it happened.

					EVELYN
			He told me about you.  That he had no
			other friend like you.

					DANNY
			Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business,
			owned their own planes.  Real straight,
			frugal.  My father was the town drunk.
			Went to sleep one night on the railroad
			tracks and was still there when the Dawn
			Express came along.  Rafe and I were the
			only ones at the funeral.  He took me
			back to his house, and I never left.

					EVELYN
			You were more like brothers.

					DANNY
			I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me
			how to fly.

					EVELYN
			He said you're the only one he ever saw
			who was better in the air than him.

					DANNY
			...He said that?

	Evelyn nods, still staring away from Danny.  This pierces
	Danny; he looks away, struggling not to let the emotions pull
	him completely under.

					DANNY
			Look, uh...Rafe's dad...he wrote me with
			the news, and it took me a couple of days
			to work up the guts to come here and tell
			you.  I'm not as brave as Rafe, or as
			noble.  But if there's anything I can
			ever do to help -- you let me know, okay?

	She stares into the distance.  He stands and puts his hand on
	top of hers, as much for his comfort as for hers.

					DANNY
			I understand why Rafe loved you.  You're
			as strong as he was.

	Since she's still not looking at him, he starts to move away.
	When he reaches the turn in the path, he looks back, and sees
	her figure in the gathering darkness.  She's begun to break
	down; and as he watches, her whole body starts convulsing,
	and she doubles up in shattering grief.

	Danny can't just stand there; he moves back to her, and puts
	a hand on her shoulder.  He sits beside her again, and
	suddenly she turns to him and sobs upon him.  Danny wraps her
	gently in his arms, and then he breaks down, having found the
	first place he can truly grieve.

	EXT.  JAPANESE BOMBING PRACTICE - JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY

	The Japanese have constructed a replica of Pearl Harbor on
	their practice island; erecting new target barriers and
	silhouettes of the various ships anchored at Pearl.  Streams
	of Japanese planes skim overhead in practice bombing runs,
	dropping dummy torpedoes and bombs.  From a control platform
	erected on the beach, Yamamoto and Genda oversee it all.

					YAMAMOTO
			Everything real except the fact that no
			one is shooting back at us.

					GENDA
			If we achieve surprise, they will offer
			little resistance.

					YAMAMOTO
			Set up teams of radio operators to send
			out messages the Americans will
			intercept, concerning every potential
			American target in the Pacific.  Include
			Hawaii -- the clutter will be more
			confusing that way.

					GENDA
			Brilliant, Admiral.

					YAMAMOTO
			A brilliant man would find a way not to
			fight a war.

	He looks out at the planes roaring into his practice harbor
	at top speed...

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Roosevelt's valet leans over him.

	Roosevelt wakes; beside the valet is a Presidential AIDE.

					AIDE
			Mr. President, we've received a message
			from the Argentinian ambassador to Japan.
			His sources tell him the Japanese are
			assembling their fleet to attack us.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			We're picking up warnings for every
			American base in the Pacific.  Does this
			ambassador know the target?

					AIDE
			Not for sure.  But he thinks it's Pearl
			Harbor.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			Tell the Pentagon.

	The Aide leaves quickly and Roosevelt starts to get out of
	bed; his valet comes to help him.

					PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
			No, George, I need the practice, in case
			there's a fire.

	Roosevelt drags himself out of bed, crawling toward the
	bathroom, his powerful arms dragging his lifeless legs.

	INT.  PENTAGON - DAY

	ADMIRALS and other OFFICERS are gathered around a giant map
	of the Pacific.

					ADMIRAL
			The attack seems inevitable.  The
			question is where?  The way to answer
			that question is to ask:  if we were the
			Japanese, how would we do it?

	He nods to a VICE ADMIRAL, who stands over the map.

					VICE ADMIRAL
			Between America and the Far East are the
			sea lanes where the winds and the
			currents make the best route for
			shipping.  Far above is the northern
			route, between Canada and Russia.
			Between these two is something they call
			the Vacant Sea.  If I were the Japs, I'd
			send a task force there.  You could hide
			the entire land mass of Asia in the
			Vacant Sea, and nobody would know.

					ADMIRAL
			So they pop out and attack where?

					VICE ADMIRAL
			That's the problem, Admiral.  They could
			hit anywhere they want.

	Nobody has any solution.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

	A huge Japanese fleet steams toward Hawaii.  It is an awesome
	sight.  Carriers, battleships, destroyers, and entire battle
	group, traveling under complete radio silence, their hulls
	power through the waves.  On the lower decks of the carriers
	are hundreds of planes -- fighters and bombers.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The American ships are lined up at anchor, calm, placid.

	EXT.  BEACH - DAY

	The sailors and soldiers bask in the sun, play volleyball.

	The aircraft carrier Lexington steams past toward the harbor
	entrance.

					VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 1
			Where's the Lexington going?

					VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 2
			Out on maneuvers, like the Enterprise.

	EXT.  GOLF COURSES - OAHU - DAY

	Men in military haircuts -- officers -- stroll the golf
	courses, enjoying themselves.

	INT.  DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

	The DENTIST, an ethnic Japanese, is working on a patient with
	his mouth agape.  The DENTIST ASSISTANT intrudes.

					DENTAL ASSISTANT
			Dr. Takanawa, you have a call from Tokyo.

					DENTIST
			Please excuse me.  Just relax.

	Leaving his patient with a mouth full of instruments, the
	Dentist moves to his outer office, which looks directly out
	over Pearl Harbor.  He speaks in Japanese.

					DENTIST
			Takanawa... Yes?...

	He seems confused by the call, but he responds by looking out
	over the harbor, then saying into the receiver --

					DENTIST
			Yes, they are all...no wait, I see the
			big one moving.  The one that's flat on
			top, what do they call it?...

	INT.  SURVEILLANCE BASE - DAY

	Some tired Army Intelligence types -- A LISTENER, a TRACKER,
	and an INTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR, are sitting at a bank of
	phones.  The LISTENER is a Japanese-American.

					LISTENER
			Here's something, over the line from
			Tokyo.

	He switches on the recording equipment and looks to the
	TRACER, sitting at a battery of equipment.

					TRACER
			It's connected to a local dentist.  His
			office is beside Pearl Harbor.

					INTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR
			This dentist, is he a spy?

					LISTENER
			Sounds too innocent.  His accent is from
			the old country.  Somebody official-
			sounding calls, he thinks it's
			discourteous not to respond.

	INT.  BARBER SHOP - DAY

	Admiral Kimmel is settling into the barber chair when his
	AIDE enters and nods for the barber to move a few paces away,
	so that he can speak privately.

					AIDE
			Sir, we just had an intelligence
			intercept.  Someone from Tokyo called a
			local dentist whose office looks over
			Pearl.  They wanted to know the exact
			location of the ships.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			Someone from Tokyo asks a dentist how the
			ships are sitting... What are we supposed
			to do about that?

					AIDE
			I...don't know, Sir.  But it just seemed
			significant.

					ADMIRAL KIMMEL
			Have intelligence keep monitoring him.

	The Admiral sinks back into the chair.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	A young amateur PHOTOGRAPHER, about 16, wearing a hat with
	"PICTURES OF PARADISE" printed on it's crown is ready to snap
	a shot of Evelyn and her nurse friends having a picnic lunch
	on the lawn outside the hospital.

					PHOTOGRAPHER
			Closer, ladies!  Closer!  Now smile!...
			Great!  Next week I'll show you a print
			and you can order your Pictures of
			Paradise!

	He hustles off.  Betty hands out picnic baskets.

					BETTY
			Barbara, here's yours...and Evelyn, here
			you are.

	Evelyn opens her basket, and finds a lei of Hawaiian flowers
	stuffed in the top.  Betty scoots over and puts the flowers
	around Evelyn's neck.

					BETTY
			It's been a month and you haven't smiled.
			We just want you to know we love you.

	Evelyn's touched -- but before she can react two P-40's zoom
	out of the skies, wings clipping the tops of the palm trees
	as they blast over head.

	INT.  COCKPIT'S OF THE P-40'S - DAY

	Danny and Anthony are the pilots; as they pull up and away,
	they pass over some officers on the golf course, scaring the
	shit out of them as they putt.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	The nurses have sprawled to the ground; now even Evelyn is
	smiling.

					BARBARA
			What is it with nurses and pilots?

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - EVENING

	Evelyn walks out of the hospital.  She's still wearing her
	lei.  The sun is going down in a spectacular sunset.

	She stares at the orange glow at the edge of the world.  She
	breathes in the sea air, and tries to breathe out the
	sadness.  The water of the harbor laps close to where she
	stands, the sunset polishing its surface.

	She takes the lei from her neck, plucks a single flower, and
	holds it like the rose Rafe once gave her.  Then she tosses
	the rest of the lei into the ocean and watches it float away,
	as the sun sinks behind the horizon.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Evelyn finds her purse, and tucks the flower into it.  She's
	alone in the hospital, everyone else has gone; she turns her
	mind toward work, something to lose herself in.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE - NEAR THE PILOTS' BARRACKS - DAY

	Danny is walking toward the barracks when a COLONEL hopping
	mad, confronts him.

					COLONEL
			You're Walker, right?

					DANNY
			Yes Sir.

					COLONEL
			That was a nice little stunt you pulled,
			buzzing the base.

					DANNY
			You liked that?

					COLONEL
			Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting
			you out of the squadron.

					DANNY
			Sir?

					COLONEL
			I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you
			and your buddies are gonna transfer your
			planes up to Haleiwa.

					DANNY
			Hale-what?

					COLONEL
			You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just
			lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.

					DANNY
			Sir, I --

					COLONEL
			Too late for apologies, Walker.

					DANNY
			I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was
			just gonna say it was worth it to feel
			like a real pilot again, even if it was
			only for five seconds.

	The Colonel glares at him and stalks away.

	INT.  BASE CANTEEN - NIGHT

	Danny and Evelyn are having coffee at the base canteen.

					DANNY
			How's everything?

					EVELYN
			We got some soldiers in traction from a
			jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except
			for the occasional fighter plane buzzing
			us.

					DANNY
			That might not have been such a good
			idea.  They're making us fly out of a
			half-paved airfield.  The real punishment
			is that I won't be back to the barracks
			till it's too late for dinner or coffee.
			So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.

					EVELYN
			I was just thinking that war is a series
			of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why
			we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to
			Rafe?

					DANNY
			I swore not to talk about him tonight,
			but there's all this stuff I think I
			ought to tell you, that he didn't get a
			chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He
			had such high expectations of himself
			that he always felt empty.  The week he
			met you he told me he felt his heart had
			always lived in winter, and for the first
			time in his life he has seen the spring.

	He's been lost in his own thoughts of Rafe; now he notices
	the tears welling up in her eyes.

					DANNY
			Sorry.

					EVELYN
			He told me he didn't want to leave me
			with regret.  Now that's all I have.

					DANNY
			Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?

					EVELYN
			Well...sure.

					DANNY
			From the air?

	EXT.  HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT

	A P-40 takes off from the remote airfield, lit only by the
	full moon.

	INT.  P-40 - NIGHT

	Evelyn sits on Danny's lap, like Rafe sat in his Daddy's lap
	years before.  Danny flies easily, the cockpit open, his arms
	slipped under hers.

	The sky above them is startlingly clear; a billion stars
	dancing around a full moon.

					EVELYN
			So beautiful!

					DANNY
			Hang on.

	He spins the plane in an easy half turn, inverting their
	heads above Pearl Harbor, gorgeous in the moonlight, the
	battleships aglow, the moon reflected in the peaceful water,
	embraced by the island of Oahu.

	EXT.  HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT

	The P-40 soars easily in and settles to earth.  Danny shuts
	down the engine.  Danny carefully removes the harness around
	her.  She looks overhead.  The stars are still bright above
	them.

					EVELYN
			I didn't realize until tonight that I've
			stopped wanting to live.

	She turns in his lap, and looks at him.  Their eyes connect.
	Tentatively, almost reluctantly, they kiss.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	The POV of someone moving through the gathering darkness
	approaches the hospital.

	The lights from within the hospital, and the pristine white
	beds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow,
	where Evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina in a
	giant's jewel box.

	Now we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and can
	tell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't tell
	who.  He's standing dead still, transfixed in watching Evelyn
	through the windows.

	INT.  BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Evelyn moves to her desk, and sits down.  She looks at the
	calender turning back to October, where she wrote on the
	square of October 22, "Order supplies" -- she counts the
	weeks from then to today, December 6.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	We see the full figure of the man watching her.  And now we
	see his face.  It is Rafe.

	His left hand is bandaged, but he is very much alive --
	though seeing Evelyn has taken his breath, and even seems to
	have robbed him of the power to move.  His eyes pick up every
	detail of her -- her face...her hands.

	And as Rafe watches Evelyn, he has the SUDDEN JOLTS OF
	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS...punctuated by fragments of the letter
	she wrote to him, and INTERCUT with Rafe in the present,
	watching Evelyn.

					EVELYN'S VOICE
			Dearest Rafe --

	IN SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK, RAFE'S SPITFIRE, crippled and
	trailing smoke, passing through a patch of cloud as Rafe
	hurls himself from the cockpit and jerks the ripcord of his
	chute.

	IN THE PRESENT...Rafe's face winces with the memory, and he
	rivets his eyes on Evelyn, as if to force himself to know
	that this moment is real.

	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK...RAFE LANDS IN THE WATER, and the shock
	of its coldness travels up his body faster than his body
	sinks into the water.  He's cloaked in the fog; his
	parachute, pushed by the wind, is pulling him along face
	down.  He fights with the straps, flips himself over, and
	pulls the release...

	But he's still in desperate trouble; in his flying clothes,
	his heavy leather jacket soaking with sea-water, he's going
	down; his body sinks beneath the surface...

					EVELYN'S VOICE
			...Every sunset...

	IN THE PRESENT, Rafe's chest trembles... Is it from the
	memory of the frozen water, from the emotion of seeing Evelyn
	again -- or both?

	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS -- Below the surface of the North Sea,
	Rafe's body drifts, but he fights his way back up...he kicks
	off his shoes, sheds the jacket, strips off his pants and
	starts tying the cuffs into knots.

	Then, in a CUT, he is floating in the water, his pants turned
	into a makeshift life preserver, his body shaking
	convulsively from the cold.

	Then in another CUT we see him after he's been in the water
	for so long that his body no longer trembles; he's lost
	consciousness.  He has no strength, no will to live... His
	face settles into the water...his body slips from his
	preserver, and drifts beneath the surface...

					EVELYN'S VOICE
			...gather it's heat into my heart, and
			send it to you...

	IN FLASHBACK, Rafe beneath the surface... His eyes come open.
	From his POV beneath the water, he sees something above the
	surface.  It's only in his mind, but that makes it no less
	real...an orange glow, the warmth of the sunset, and her face
	above the surface... His limbs come to life, and he fights
	his way up, breaking the surface.  The whole sea around him
	is dark and empty, but he grabs his makeshift preserver and
	holds on for dear life...and for Evelyn.

	IN THE PRESENT Rafe stares through the window, at Evelyn, but
	he can't go in.  He backs away from the window.

	INT.  PILOT'S BARRACKS - NIGHT

	A Japanese-American MESSAGE BOY parks his motorbike outside
	and enters the barracks.

					MESSAGE BOY
			Daniel Walker?...

	Danny rises from his bunk and accepts the telegram.  As the
	message boy leaves, Danny reads... The news he learns stuns
	him...

	EXT.  BENCH - OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Rafe is still lost in thought.  He hears steps running up --
	and sees Danny -- who spots him at the same moment.

					DANNY
			Rafe!

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Evelyn puts away the calender.

	EXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Rafe is sitting at the bench, his head down.

	ANGLE - Evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench,
	his form hauntingly familiar.  He hears her, and looks up.
	It's Rafe.

	From Evelyn's POV, the whole world spins.  She faints.

	Rafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground.  He
	gathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face.
	He's real, very real.

					RAFE
			Evelyn.

	She's trembling, shaking.  He lifts her to her feet, and
	moves her to the bench.

					RAFE
			I sent telegrams, I guess the military
			traffic held them up.

					EVELYN
			Why were you sitting here, instead of...

					RAFE
			I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just
			stood there wondering if you knew.  You
			looked...sad, and I had to sit down a
			minute.

					EVELYN
			How did you?...

					RAFE
			...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog,
			and nobody could see me.  I hit the water
			hard.  And it was so...cold.

	He looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades
	to black.  There's something he thinks about saying, and
	doesn't.  Then...

					RAFE
			I don't know how long I was in the water.
			A Norwegian freighter picked me up.  They
			were headed to Spain.  They docked in La
			Rota, right beside a German ship, and
			told me to stay hidden below.  I was
			afraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some
			clothes, jumped ship, and found a church,
			where the priest contacted the
			resistance, and got me on a freighter to
			New York.

	He looks at her, then looks down again.

					RAFE
			I called my folks, then Colonel
			Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to
			pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me.
			I told the Colonel I needed to see
			somebody first, and he had a supply
			flight heading out in an hour.
				(beat)
			I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't
			said anything.

					EVELYN
			I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know
			that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't
			you?

					RAFE
			Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.

	At these words, she looks at him for a long, long moment.

					EVELYN
			It's been...so different, being so sure
			you were dead.

					RAFE
			I'm so sorry for what you must've gone
			through, but I'm back.

	He sees the troubled look on her face.

					RAFE
			Maybe I've assumed too much.  Has
			something changed?
				(beat)
			I'm afraid to ask what.  And I'm afraid
			not to.
				(beat)
			Have you fallen in love?

	She nods; she can't even say it.  Rafe's dying inside.

					RAFE
			It's all right.  Danny always said I see
			things with my emotions instead of my
			eyes.

					EVELYN
			It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I
			wrote you, they --

					RAFE
			Don't worry about that.  Guys away from
			home, lonely, good-hearted women try to
			cheer them up.

					EVELYN
			It's not that I didn't mean everything I
			wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you
			were dead.  And now --

	Danny runs up, through the darkness.

					DANNY
			You're alive!

	Rafe and Danny stare at each other; Danny hesitates, looking
	from Rafe to Evelyn, wondering what they've said.  Then Rafe
	looks at Evelyn, and picks up the look on her face.  In that
	moment he puts it all together.

					RAFE
			Aw, God.  Oh my God.

	Danny's speechless, and for a moment Evelyn is too.

					EVELYN
			Rafe --

	He puts up a hand, to silence her, and walks away suddenly.
	Evelyn and Danny are left frozen.

	EXT.  SHORE OF PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe stares out at the harbor, seeing nothing.  As he stands
	there alone and shattered, he has one more

	SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK

	Rafe is in the water of the North Sea; he seems dead, but his
	makeshift preserver is keeping his face above the surface.
	Something slides through the water and stops beside him; it's
	a dinghy, and behind it is a trawler.

	Hands grab Rafe and drag him onto the dinghy...

	In a QUICK CUT, Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the
	trawler.  The crewmen think he's dead.  His body is stiff,
	his lips white; and they say so, in Norwegian...

	But one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid,
	then quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses
	back an eyelid to see his pupils.  Rafe's white lips move.
	The crewmen realize he's trying to say something.

	And Rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the
	Norwegian crewmen don't understand.

					RAFE
			Evelyn...

	IN THE PRESENT Rafe struggles to bury that memory so far that
	he'll never feel it again.

	EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Danny escorts Evelyn back to her quarters.

					DANNY
			Don't worry.  I'll find him.

	He hugs her; their embrace earnest yet tingled with guilt,
	and Danny leave quickly.  Betty steps out of the nurses'
	quarters and hands Evelyn a telegram.

					BETTY
			This came while you were gone.

	Evelyn knows it's the telegram from Rafe, to tell her he's
	alive.  Without opening it, she begins to cry, and hurries
	away from the barracks so the other nurses won't see.

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - NIGHT

	Danny crosses the tarmac toward the clustered P-40's.  He
	spots what he's looking for.  Sitting in the cockpit of one
	of the P-40's is Rafe.  Rafe won't look at him.  Danny climbs
	up on the wing, and sits down there.

					DANNY
			You'd always go sit in a plane whenever
			you were upset.

					RAFE
			Upset?  Why should I be upset?

					DANNY
			Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're
			scared to talk about it.

	CLOSE - A Mai-Tai volcano clunks onto a table.

	INT.  FUNKY OAHU BAR - DAY

					DANNY
			Drink up.  Then we'll talk.

	Rafe takes the challenge, and takes a long pull on one of the
	straws.  Red, Anthony, Billy, and several others enter the
	bar.

					ANTHONY
			Rafe?!

	They rush the table...

	INT.  FUNKY OAHU BAR - LATER

	They're all drinking, and the whole bar is rocking.  Rafe
	uses glasses to show his buddies tactics.

					RAFE
			They'll go under you because their planes
			are faster, then they run so you can't
			catch 'em.  But then they'll come around
			and take you from behind -- like some
			Americans will.

	The last words bring the group to silence.  The other guys
	drift away, to give them room.

					RAFE
			Sorry.

					DANNY
			Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's
			better to come out with it.

					RAFE
			I didn't mean it.

					DANNY
			Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you
			think.

					RAFE
			Waitress!  Four beers!

					DANNY
			You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.

					RAFE
			If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.

	The waitress delivers four bottles to the table.  Rafe takes
	a slow sip, then stares at Danny.

					RAFE
			We gotta face some facts here.

					DANNY
			What facts are those?

					RAFE
			I understand how it could happen.  I know
			why any guy would love her.  And I can't
			blame you that it happened.  You thought
			I was dead, she was grieving, you were
			trying to help her.

					DANNY
			I was grieving too.

					RAFE
			Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.

					DANNY
			So what are you saying?

					RAFE
			I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time
			for you to fuck off.

					DANNY
			You left her.  How's that for a fact?

					RAFE
			How's this for a fact?  I loved her
			first.

	Danny takes a long pull of beer, and Rafe does the same.

					DANNY
			You know, you're a lousy drinker.
			Drinking's supposed to make men feel
			bigger.  It only makes you stupid.  And
			weak.

	Rafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer.

					RAFE
			How's this?

	BAM!  He knocks Danny out of the chair, flat on his ass.
	Danny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth.

					DANNY
			You want it, you got it.

	He kicks Rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in
	the chest as he goes down, and the fight is on.

	The bar's bouncer, a big Samoan, moves over to break them up
	-- but Anthony steps in his way.

					ANTHONY
			Let 'em fight, they need it.

	The bouncer tosses Anthony aside, but before he can move in
	to interrupt the fight, Red breaks a lava volcano of Mai-Tai
	over the bouncer's skull.  The bartender picks up the phone
	to call the M.P.'s.

	Rafe and Danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the
	room.  Sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their
	stools to watch the action.  The other pilots are wincing
	with the punches their friends exchange, and bobbing and
	weaving as if in the fight themselves.  A SAILOR tapes Billy.

					SAILOR
			Is this a private fight or can anybody
			jump in?

	Billy hits him.  The whole bar erupts.

	Rafe and Danny are really having at it, fueled by so much
	emotion that nothing hurts.  They're on the floor now, trying
	to rip each other apart.  They struggle to their feet and
	Rafe manages to knee Danny in the balls.  Danny doubles over
	in pain.

					RAFE
			That hurt?  I didn't think you had any
			balls.

	Without looking up, Danny lunges at Rafe, tackling him around
	the waist, driving him at the wall.

	But they don't hit the wall; they tumble through the back
	window of the bar -- not covered in glass, but fronds and
	wood -- and out into the back alley.

	They're lying there in the debris when they see the M.P.
	jeeps coming.  They drag each other to their feet, and run
	away.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Japanese task force rumbles through the night, the bows
	of the great ships blasting through the crashing waves.

	INT.  AIRCRAFT CARRIER AKAGI - NIGHT

	Yamamoto's flagship.  The clock reaches midnight, and a
	sailor tears off it's calender.  It's December 7, 1941.

					YAMAMOTO
			The submarines will be reaching the
			harbor soon.  I hope they don't set off
			the alarm too soon.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	An American destroyer, the SELFRIDGE, leads a squadron of
	destroyers on patrol, near the entrance of Pearl Harbor.
	LOOKOUTS on the bridge think they spot something.

	INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DESTROYER SELFRIDGE - NIGHT

	The WATCH OFFICER listens to a report on his headset and
	turns to the CAPTAIN.

					WATCH OFFICER
			Captain, lookouts report a sighting, two
			points off the starboard beam.

	The sonar operator looks up and nods.

					SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN
			How big?

					SONAR OPERATOR
			...I've lost it.

					SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN
			Probably a blackfish.  I've seen them
			look like subs.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Another destroyer, the RALPH TALBOT, cruises behind the
	Selfridge.  On it's bridge, the DUTY OFFICER speaks to the
	CAPTAIN.

					DUTY OFFICER
			Sir, Selfridge reports a contact, then
			lost it.  Now our sonar reports the
			contact.

	The Captain looks toward the Selfridge, then trains his
	binoculars on the water were the Duty Officer points.  He
	sees something dark and black slipping along beneath the
	surface.  He gets onto his intercom.

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			Radio room!  Raise the Selfridge.  Tell
			the Squadron Commander we have spotted a
			sub and request permission to depth
			charge.

	He looks again at the black shape, passing a few hundred
	yards from them.

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			We're five miles from Pearl Harbor and
			it's moving in from the open sea.
			Prepare to move to attack speed.

	The INTERCOM comes alive.

					INTERCOM
			Sir, the Squadron Commander on Selfridge
			denies permission.

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			What?

					INTERCOM
			Denies, Sir.  He says it's a blackfish.

	The Captain chokes back his frustration and shuts down the
	intercom -- but then he says to the Duty Officer, as they
	watch the shape disappear toward Pearl Harbor...

					CAPTAIN OF THE RALPH TALBOT
			If it's a blackfish, it has a motorboat
			up it's ass!

	EXT.  OAHU - ROAD - NIGHT

	Danny has pulled his Buick convertible off the road; Rafe is
	bent over, his head out of frame; he's throwing up.  Danny's
	banged up from the fight and still drunk himself; he waits
	beside Rafe, who chokes out between heaves --

					RAFE
			How come you're not pukin'?

					DANNY
			I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like
			throwing up every minute since you got
			back.

	Rafe straightens up, but the waves of sickness come back over
	him and he bends over again.  Danny looks at his friend, and
	the pain is written on Danny's face.

					DANNY
			Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like
			you're thinking.

					RAFE
				(between heaves)
			Fuck you.

					DANNY
			She loves you.  I know that.  And part of
			what she loves in me is how much of you
			she sees in me.

	Rafe doesn't seem to be listening; but Danny knows he is.

					DANNY
			We were both torn up.  I started dropping
			by to see her, because we understood what
			each other felt.  We'd have coffee and
			try not to talk about you, but we always
			would.

	Rafe stands to face Danny; this is hard for Danny to say.

					DANNY
			She said I was so much like you.  I said,
			No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of
			you, but I'm not you, not as good as you.
			Everybody else saw me as a loser with a
			big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw
			the better part of me, the part of me
			that could be like you, and changed me.
			You made me who I am.

					RAFE
			How sweet.  Is that when you put the move
			on her?

	Danny slams his fist into Rafe's sick gut.  Rafe doubles over
	again, coughing, nothing left in his belly to come up.

	Rafe stand slowly, nodding as if he knows the punch was what
	he deserved.  Danny's about to apologize when once more Rafe
	knees him in the balls.

	Danny folds up, drops to his knees, and starts to retch.

					RAFE
			That's better.

	Rafe crawls into the back seat of the car and passes out,
	Danny still collapsed at the side of the road.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT

	The Japanese task force storms on.

	INT.  JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS - NIGHT

	IN THE PREP DECKS, the planes are being armed with bombs and

	EXT.  UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE PACIFIC - NIGHT

	A Japanese submarine with a midget sub attached to its hull
	runs silently toward Pearl Harbor.

	EXT.  OCEAN SURFACE - NIGHT

	The periscope of the submarine breaks the surface.

	INT.  JAPANESE SUB - NIGHT

	The sub commander looks through the periscope and sees the
	lights of Oahu far in the distance.

					SUB COMMANDER
			Prepare to launch midget sub.

	INT.  BUNK AREA OF SUB, BETWEEN TORPEDOES - NIGHT

	The sailor who will drive the midget sub completes his

	his personal shrine.

					SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)
			My revered father, I go now to fulfill my
			mission and my destiny.

	INT.  THE LAUNCH OF THE MIDGET SUB - NIGHT

	We see the sub surface, and the sailor exit the main hatch of
	the big sub, then force himself through the tiny hatch of the
	midget sub.

					SAILOR'S VOICE (LETTER)
			I hope it is a destiny that will bring
			honor to our family, and if it requires

	EXT.  FLIGHT DECK, JAPANESE CARRIER - NIGHT

	A single scout plane launches into the air.

	INT.  SCOUT PLANE - NIGHT

	The plane climbs to a high altitude, toward the dawn and
	Pearl Harbor.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Japanese carriers turn into the wind and raise combat
	pennants.  A color guard raises the Japanese flag as the deck
	crew stand at attention, seeing the rising-sun flag snap
	potently in the wind.

	EXT.  JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS - NIGHT

	The first wave of Japanese planes begins to launch.  It is a
	stirring sight for the Japanese; the pilots waiting in their
	cockpits, the officers watching from the bridge, the seamen
	on the flight deck.

	The first plane taxis along the flight deck and lifts into
	the sky.  The seamen cheer and wave their caps.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - NEAR PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	The American destroyer WARD cuts through the water, moving
	back into port after a night patrol.  It's CAPTAIN is on the
	bridge, and its lookouts are still scanning the waters.

					LOOKOUT
			Captain, do you see that, in our wake?

	The Captain raises his binoculars and looks out behind the
	ship.  He sees something small and black there.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
			That's a conning tower.

					OFFICER
			Could it be one of ours?

					CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
			He's trying to follow us through the sub
			nets, into the harbor.  Sink the son of a
			bitch.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE DESTROYER WARD - NIGHT

	The deck gun barks, aimed toward the conning tower of the
	Japanese sub in the distance.  The first shot sails directly
	over the tower, missing.

	INT.  THE SUB'S CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Japanese sub commander sees, through his periscope, the
	flame erupt on the Ward's deck; he's being fired upon.  He
	snaps orders --

					JAPANESE SUB CAPTAIN
			Dive!  Dive!

	EXT.  THE DECK OF THE WARD - NIGHT

	The gunners snap in another shell and fire again.  It's a
	direct hit, the sub is ripped apart, it rolls over.

	INT.  WARD'S BRIDGE - NIGHT

	The Captain watches the sub sinking and snaps an order.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WARD
			Fleet command, from destroyer Ward.  Have
			fired upon and sunk enemy submarine

	EXT.  ESTABLISHING - RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

	INT.  RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

	There are two guys left in the room, yawning over their new
	radar equipment.  The Officer, ELLIS, checks his watch; it's
	a few minutes after seven a.m.

					ELLIS
			Time to shut her down.  That was a good
			first session.  You'll get the hang of
			this new radar soon.

					PRIVATE
			Thank you, Sir.  Hey...what's this?

	His screen shows a huge cloud of blips, heading toward them.

					ELLIS
			I've never seen anything like that
			before.

	He gets on the telephone.

	INT.  ARMY HEADQUARTERS - DAWN

	The phone rings and an officer answers.

					OFFICER
			Watch command... Coming from which
			direction?... Hold on.

	He covers the phone and tells his commander --

					OFFICER
			Radar station has picked up a cloud of
			blips, coming in from the northeast.

	He switches on the radio, and tunes it to KGMB; hearing the
	Hawaiian music reassures him something...

					COMMANDER
			KGMB is on early.  That means we've got a
			flight of B-17's coming in from the
			mainland, they use the radio music for a
			homing beacon.

	INT.  RADAR STATION - PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

	Dismayed, Ellis listens to the response from the
	headquarters.

					ELLIS
			All right, Sir.
				(he hangs up)
			They say don't worry about it.

	He and the private look again at the cloud of blips --
	growing ever larger, and moving in fast.

	EXT.  THE SKIES ABOVE THE PACIFIC - DAY

	The Japanese formations are streaking through the sky.

	INT.  THE COCKPITS - DAY

	The Japanese bombers, with three-man crews, are listening to
	the Hawaiian music of the radio station, using it for their

	beautiful, and resembles the Japanese flag.

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAWN

	The Japanese scout plane is high in the air.  It radios --

					SCOUT PLANE PILOT
			Harbor quiet.  Ships in place.  Carriers
			gone.

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE THE PACIFIC - DAY

	The Japanese planes increase throttle and nose down, diving
	toward the surface, hurtling into attack mode.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The harbor lies quiet.  It's a sleepy Sunday morning.
	Children are playing, officers are stepping from their houses
	in their shorts to get the morning paper...

	EXT.  MOUNTAINSIDE - OAHU - DAY

	Hawaiian Boy Scouts are hiking on a side of one of the
	mountains overlooking Pearl.

	Suddenly booming over the mountain, barely ten feet above the
	summit, comes a stream of planes.

	The boys are awed.  What is this?

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	QUICK INTERCUTS - Between the approach of the Japanese
	planes, and sleepy Pearl Harbor...

	-- The planes, in formation, their propellers spinning, their
	   engines throbbing...

	-- Pearl Harbor, with the ships silent, their engines cold,
	   their anchors steady on the harbor bottom.

	-- The Japanese submarines heading in.

	-- The American destroyers docking, instead of going out to
	   search for them.

	-- Another formation of Japanese bombers climbing high, into
	   attack position.

	-- The Japanese torpedo planes dropping down to the level of
	   the ocean, their engines beginning to scream.

	-- The American planes bunched on the airfields.

	-- ON THE JAPANESE CARRIERS, Yamamoto and his staff huddle
	   tensely, over their battle maps.

	ON THE JAPANESE CARRIER DECKS, the second wave of planes is
	being brought up and loaded with munitions...the Japanese
	flag snaps tautly in the wind...

	ON THE GOLD COURSE NEAR PEARL HARBOR, American officers are
	laughing on the putting green near the club house, where the
	American flag droops from the flag pole, limply at peace.

	-- The Japanese planes roaring down just over the wave tops
	   of Pearl Harbor itself.

	-- Children playing in the early morning sun, looking up as
	   they see the planes flash by.  The children look --
	   they've never seen this many, flying this low...but they
	   are not alarmed, only curious.

	The images come faster and faster, the collision of Japan's
	determination and American's innocence...

	EXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY

	Two sailors are standing on the deck, sharing a smoke,
	looking out over the quiet harbor.  One of them sees the
	first few planes streaking in.

					SAILOR 1
			Look at that.

					SAILOR 2
			It's the Army again, practicing on us.

	Something drops from the lead plane and splashes easily into
	the water; the plane banks away.

					SAILOR 2
			Practice torpedoes.

	A white streak runs through the water at them.

					SAILOR 2
			Now listen, you'll hear a little thud
			when it hits the side of the ship.

	They watch it rush at them...then, a MASSIVE EXPLOSION!  It
	throws up a fifty foot wall of water, hurling the sailors and
	everything else on the deck into the sea.

	EXT.  THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	-- The first wave of planes drop more torpedoes; they plunge
	   BENEATH THE SURFACE, their wooden fins working perfectly,
	   the torpedoes speeding to their targets...

	We see their AWESOME BLASTS against the anchored ships as the
	torpedoes hit home.

	-- The Japanese LOW ALTITUDE BOMBERS come in; some drop their
	   bombs directly into the ships; some skip their bombs
	   across the water, the bombs glancing off the surface and
	   then slamming the sides of battleships with tremendous
	   explosions.

	-- INSIDE THE SHIPS, sleeping sailors are thrown from their
	   bunks; those already awakened run for their battle
	   stations, and try to make it up to the deck; but there's
	   no escape there, as...

	-- Zero fighter planes strafe the ships, raking the decks and
	   killing sailors with MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	EXT.  ON THE AMERICAN SHIPS - DAY

	Fire and smoke are turning everything into chaos.  some
	sailors rush to man the guns, they find the ammo boxes
	locked.

	Under the bombing and strafing, they find a wrench and start
	pounding on the lock, trying to break open the ammo box.
	Then they break open the lock -- and find the ammo box empty.

					SAILOR
			Shit!  I'll get some ammo!

	He runs for the ladders, and is shot down before he gets
	there.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The dive bombers scream in.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Bombs are hitting the deck.  Sailors are blown into the air
	and out into the oily water.  Nearby ships are catching fire;
	the flames spread out onto the oily water itself.

	INT.  BELOW DECKS OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie Miller, the boxing champion/kitchen helper, is working
	picking up the breakfast trays when he feels the ship
	shudder.  The intercom comes alive --

					INTERCOM
			Battle stations!  Battle stations!  This
			is not a drill!

	Men run to the ladders, and the shaking of the ship from a
	bomb blast tosses them off; Dorie's at the foot of the ladder
	when men fall back on top of him.

	EXT.  BRIDGE OF WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	The Captain of the ship has reached the command bridge, where
	most of his staff is lying wounded from a bomb blast.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Stay calm!  Find your positions.  Medics,
			get the wounded to sick bay!  Load and --

	MORE TORPEDOES and BOMBS blast into the ship.  A big chunk of
	shrapnel tears into the Captain and rips his stomach open.
	The medics he was just directing to other men now run to him,
	as the men they were going to help have been blown apart.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Sailors run up from below and are gunned down and blasted
	down before they can reach their weapons.

	Dorie Miller emerges from below decks and sees the carnage,
	the confusion.  A bloody OFFICER grabs him.

					BLOODY OFFICER
			Boy!  We need stretcher bearers on the
			bridge!

	Dorie runs into the fire and smoke, toward the bridge.

	EXT.  BRIDGE OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie arrives to see the medics crouched over the
	disemboweled Captain, who is still giving orders.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Radio for air cover.  Organize the other
			medics.  Initiate fire control.

	Dorie helps the medic lift the Captain to take him below.

	INT.  BELOW DECKS OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie carries the Captain down the ladder by himself, using
	one arm to climb and one to hold the Captain like a child's
	teddy bear.  When they reach the bottom the pain has grown
	too much for the Captain; he know's he's dying.

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Put me down here.

	Dorie puts him down; the medic jumps down the ladder and
	reaches the Captain, who tells him --

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Find my executive officer and tell him
			he's in command.  Tell him to fire the
			boilers and...

	He trembles in death throes...

					CAPTAIN OF THE WEST VIRGINIA
			Make sure the gunners have enough
			ammuni --

	He's dead.  The Medic runs toward the ladder, reaches the
	hatch, and is blasted back to the bottom by an explosion
	overhead.

	Dorie runs for the ladder, and climbs out into hell.

	EXT.  DECK OF THE WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

	Dorie emerges into even greater carnage and confusion.  A
	sailor, his body on fire, runs past and leaps into the oily
	water -- but it is in flames too.

	Then Dorie sees it:  an unmanned anti-aircraft gun.  He runs
	to it, through the strafing.

	The gun already has a belt of ammo in it -- apparently loaded
	by the gunner who lies beside it with his chest shot open.
	Dorie swings the business end of the gun toward the Zeros
	coming in out of the smoke, and he begins to fire.

	The Zeros keep coming and he keeps firing; nothing on earth
	will knock him from that gun.

	INT.  NURSES' BARRACKS - DAY

	Evelyn is up, dressed; her roommates are just stirring.

	EXT.  NURSES' QUARTERS - OAHU - DAY

	Evelyn has stepped to the door when she hears a distant
	rumble and looks across the harbor to see smoke rising, ships
	taking hits.

					EVELYN
			Oh my God... EVERYBODY TO THE HOSPITAL!

	As she runs, Japanese planes are coming toward the base.

	EXT.  THE MESS HALL AT HICKAM FIELD - DAY

	The men were sitting down to breakfast, but the machine gun
	bullets tearing up the outer walls have them clogging the
	doors, and it's so clogged they can't all get out.

	A steel bomb crashes through the roof and slams through the
	room, taking out tables and chairs before bouncing off the
	wall and coming to a stop.

	TWO SOLDIERS, trapped within the mess hall, see it stop
	without detonating.  They are bug-eyed, hearts stopped.

					MESS HALL SOLDIER
			Dud.

	The bomb detonated, blowing everything to bloody dust.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

	Evelyn reaches the hospital first and runs to the cabinet,
	withdrawing supplies.

	Barbara and Sandra appear at the far door, both terrified.

					EVELYN
			Get everything out!  Bandages, sutures --
			oh God, the men in traction... Come with
			me!

	She races into the hallway, the other two following.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - TRACTION WARD - DAY

	Four men from a jeep accident are lying in traction, their
	casted limbs roped in the air.  Evelyn runs in, grabbing a
	razor blade from the medical cabinet -- and telling Barbara
	and Sandra.

					EVELYN
			Cut them down, and take cover!!  Hurry!

	Bombs are falling outside, on the airfield this wing of the
	hospital faces.  Evelyn slices the traction ropes of a man
	with both legs broken; ignoring his groans, she rolls him out
	of the bed and covers him with the mattress.  The other
	nurses follow her lead.  The bombs are coming toward the
	hospital ward; Evelyn finishes with the fourth man and covers
	him and herself with the mattress, just as a bomb craters
	outside the window.

	The nurses and patients look up after the explosions have
	passed; there's a chunk of smoking shrapnel lying on the
	springs of the bunk where the last man had been lying.

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - DAY

	The Japanese low-altitude bombers, with Zero escorts, zoom in
	over the field, blasting the clusters of American warplanes,
	whole squadrons taken out with one bomb.

	The mechanics and pilots, caught in the open, run from the
	strafing.  The Zeros rake them down with machine gun fire.
	It's carnage.

	EXT.  PHOTOGRAPHER'S HOUSE - DAY

	Sammy, the amateur photographer, is leaving his house for a
	morning of working his "Pictures of Paradise" business, when
	he sees the Japanese formations rumbling toward Pearl.  He
	races back inside.

	INT.  PHOTOGRAPHER'S HOUSE - DAY

	He fishes into his drawer for a film camera, and digs out
	cans of film, struggling to load it as he runs back out.

	INT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY

	The pilots of Danny's squadron have returned from their night
	of drinking and brawling and are crashed on their bunks.  Red
	stirs and staggers toward the head; he bumps into the wall,
	backs up like a wind-up toy and lurches blindly forward
	again, into --

	INT.  BARRACKS - THE HEAD - DAY

	Red sleepwalks to the urinals and unleashes a marathon piss
	stream, still in his sleep.  A rumble penetrates his brain,
	and his eyes come open a fraction.  Through the window slits
	above the urinals, he can see a cloud of Japanese planes
	rushing past.

	He squeezes his eyes shut, and looks again; the planes start
	bombing the distant hangers.

	Red pisses along the wall as he races to the barracks, trying
	to get his pecker back into his drawers.  He shouts to the
	sleeping guys --

					RED
			Th-th-th-th-th-

	He slaps his face with both hands, and stomps his feet...

					RED
			Th-th-th-th-Dammit!  Th-th-th-

	He still can't get it out, can't wake them; bursting with
	frustration, he suddenly blasts out singing --

					RED
				(singing)
			The Jaaaps!!  The Jaaaps!!

	He's belting it like a baritone in a bizarre opera.  His
	friends stir; what the hell?  Red points outside and tries to
	talk, but now he can't mutter a syllable.  The guys hear the
	explosions, and realize...

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY

	The pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed.  Seeing
	what's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the
	clustered American planes are blowing up in groups, and the
	pilots are knocked to the ground.

					BILLY
			Goddamn Japs!

	Billy jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of
	fighters that hasn't gone up yet.

					ANTHONY
			Billy!

	Anthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he
	misses; Billy gets a few steps before the fire from a
	strafing Zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror
	as Billy gets shorter as he runs; the Zero's machine gun fire
	is sawing his legs off from the feet up.

	Billy falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls
	almost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots.

	Their innocence, like America's, is gone in that moment.

	EXT.  ROAD TO MAIN AIRFIELD - DAY

	Danny and Rafe are in Danny's Buick, hung over and asleep,
	Danny in front, Rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight
	-- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one
	side of Rafe's nose and the corner of Danny's mouth.

	The rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the
	rumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation
	makes the sunlight flicker.  Danny and Rafe squint up, their
	heads pounding, and realize what they're seeing.  Suddenly
	their headaches are gone, and Danny's gunning the Buick down
	the road, toward the base.

	EXT.  AIR BASE - DAY

	Danny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy
	taking cover and haven't even closed the barrier.

	He races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still
	undamaged.  Rafe is out the door before the car stops
	rolling, and Danny's right behind him.

	They're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up
	with a bomb blast.  Rafe and Danny dive at each other; their
	first instinct is to cover their best friend with their own
	bodies.

	They look at each other on the ground.  They see machine gun
	bullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and
	ripping along the walls of the buildings.  It's as if the
	whole Japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not
	leaving a single plane airworthy.

					RAFE
			Get me into a plane!

					DANNY
			Come on!

	Danny sprints; Rafe follows.  Danny reaches a phone booth,
	and digs a dime from his pants.

					RAFE
			You're making a phone call?!

	Danny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more
	planes blow up on the flight line.  Rafe thinks he's lost his
	mind.

					DANNY
				(into phone)
			This is Walker!  We're under attack!  Get
			those planes fueled and armed RIGHT NOW!

	He runs back toward the car; Rafe, in the nonsense of battle,
	reaches in to hang up the receiver, before Danny grabs him
	and leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth
	shatters behind them from the strafing.

	On the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid
	strafing -- and see their friends lying nearby, in shock.

					ANTHONY
			They got Billy.

					DANNY
			Come with us!

	He and Rafe jump up and run again.  Anthony, Red, and several
	other pilots reach the Buick and dive in.  Danny drives away,
	through the strafing.

					RAFE
			Where are we going?

					DANNY
			Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles
			north of here.

					RAFE
			What's there?

					DANNY
			Six P-40's.

	As the Zero pilots see the Buick moving, they go after it.
	Danny drives like a madman through the strafing, zigzagging
	and gunning the Buick's V-8.

	EXT.  THE OKLAHOMA - STILL AT ANCHOR - DAY

	The number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their
	strategy flawless.  Torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull
	with a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush
	under and hit the next ship anchored behind.  The American
	battleships are bobbing like see-saws.

	The OKLAHOMA takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing
	thirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately
	begins to list.

	INT.  THE OKLAHOMA - DAY

	Doors are wedged shut by the deformation of the structure;
	vertical ladders are becoming horizontal, and water is
	pouring in.  Men fight their way up against the water.

	INT.  INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE OKLAHOMA - DAY

	Water is up to the trapped sailor's waists when they grab a
	wrench and start taking turns pounding S.O.S. in Morse code
	on the bulkhead.

	EXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY

	As the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from
	the deck into the water.  Still the Marines on deck are
	firing back at the planes; some Marines are even using
	handguns.  But courage does not save them...

	THE OKLAHOMA ROLLS OVER

	The men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the
	fires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400
	pound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and
	tumble through everything like massive wrecking balls.

	The sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to
	get away from the suction as the giant battleship turns
	turtle.

	BELOW THE WATER men are sucked down with amazing force, every
	hair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched
	to the depths.

	INSIDE THE OKLAHOMA, everyone and everything is spilling
	upside down.  The ship's generators sputter out and the
	lights go out.  The flashlights of the few sailors who can
	find them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills
	in.  There is no escape.

	BELOW THE WATER, the Oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom;
	some men are crushed there.  For others it's salvation, as
	the BACKWASH blows them toward the surface.

	ON THE SURFACE the men are launched almost completely out of
	the water, before splashing back into the water and burning
	oil.  A few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the
	propeller protrude above the surface, but most of the
	Oklahoma is under water.

	Men in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying
	wounded away from the wreckage.  A bomb hits the launch and
	blows body parts everywhere.

	INT.  OKLAHOMA - REAR COMPARTMENT

	In one compartment there are a dozen trapped men.  They've
	survived the roll-over, and are in a chaotic world where the
	floor is now the ceiling.  The water is up their waists.
	Some of the SAILORS are panicking.

	One sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the
	light from face to face.

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			Don't panic!  Don't panic!

					PANICKED SAILOR
			The water's rising!  It's coming up,
			we're all gonna drown!

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			The air pressure will equalize it!

	But the water keeps rising, along with their fears.  Several
	of the sailors are still screaming...

	The water's already to their bellies.  One of them grabs a
	wrench and starts slamming Morse code against the bulkhead.

	One sailor in the middle of the room is particularly
	panicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering --

					TERRIFIED SAILOR
			Get me out!  Get me out!

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			Stop it!  Come on!  Save your air!

					TERRIFIED SAILOR
			MY FOOT'S CAUGHT!

	He's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is
	deeper -- the ship's nose is lower than her stern.  The
	water's up to the guy's neck.

	The man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys
	foot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling -- now
	their floor.

	He pops up again.  The water's up to the trapped guy's mouth;
	he's already gagging.

					SAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
			Is there a hacksaw in that locker?!

	They open it; tools spill out -- among them is a hacksaw.
	They hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the
	guy's foot.

	The trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream.  He comes
	free, and surfaces gasping.  His severed foot floats to the
	surface and then the horror really hits them.  The sailor
	with the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood.  He
	and another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop
	the bleeding.

	The drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop
	their signaling.  Now they start banging, twice as loudly as
	before.

	EXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY

	Haleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic
	hills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is
	a quonset hut.  A mechanic named EARL, is out with the
	P-40's; and these are spread out, not bunched.

	EARL AND THE P-40'S

	The planes here have received loving care from Earl -- which
	means lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo
	belt, he yells.

					EARL
			Sum-bitch!

	The Buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to
	a stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out.

					DANNY
			They ready, Earl?

					EARL
			They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

	What stops him is the cloud of Zeros and dive bombers,
	shrieking in.

					DANNY
			Cover!

	The guys scatter.  There are sandbags around the hut, and
	they run there, diving into it's shelter just before the
	first strafing pass, when a Zero strafes one of the P-40's
	and a dive bomber blasts another.  Earl stands up in shock
	and fury.

					EARL
			You absolute mother-fuckin' son of a
			bitch!  You shot one of my planes!

	Danny pulls him down, as the Zeros roar overhead.

					DANNY
			This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's
			World War Two!

					RAFE
			They're coming around for another pass.
			You got extra weapons and ammo?

					EARL
			Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun
			lockers!

					DANNY
			You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come
			with me!

	Danny, Rafe and Earl run to the planes that got hit and strip
	out the 20mm cannons and ammo.

	INT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY

	The other pilots run in, throw open the gun locker, and start
	grabbing weapons -- aircraft machine guns, ammo belts, one
	even grabs a rifle.

	SANDBAGS BY THE SHED

	The two groups run back and start to set up.

					RAFE
			Danny, over there!  We're in a canyon,
			they'll come straight down it, we'll get
			'em in a crossfire.

	Danny, Rafe and Earl run to a gully opposite the shed and set
	up there, as the other pilots brace the machine guns against
	the sandbags.

	The Japanese planes attacks again.  This time the lead plane
	hits a wall of steel fired from the combined guns; the
	bullets chew into the bomb it carries and the plane EXPLODES.
	The airborne debris makes the following planes shear off.

	Red's standing, firing; he yells at the Zeros --

					RED
			D-don't like it when we fight back, do
			ya!

	Red runs out with his machine gun and keeps firing even when
	the planes have passed, trying to shoot them right up the
	ass.

					DANNY
			Earl!  You said the planes were ready
			but -- but what?

					EARL
			Of the four left, only one is full of
			fuel.

					RAFE
			Will the others get into the air?

	Earl shoots a look to Rafe, then turns to Danny.

					EARL
			Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.

					DANNY
			Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma,
			you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come
			with us!  Earl, you get on the radio!
			We're gonna fight these fuckers.

	Two of the pilots, Joe and Theo, run to Danny.

					JOE
			How do we do it?

					DANNY
			Your call, Rafe.

					RAFE
			Get rolling as fast as you can.  Stay
			low!  We'll use the topography to
			separate them and then we can take 'em
			one on one.

	They race toward the planes, and the Japanese attack again.
	Seeing the pilots running for the P-40's, the Zeros aim for
	them; Rafe and Danny race for the most distant of the planes;
	Joe and Theo run for the closer planes, through the dusty
	bullet hits.

	Theo makes his plane and is just strapping himself in when
	bullets stitch his fuselage, wounding him.  He still forces
	the plane forward.  He taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets
	chopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters
	to a stop, Theo dead at the controls.

	Joe doesn't bother to strap in; he hits the throttle hard and
	heads down the runway...

	The Zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120 M.P.H.
	The Zero's bullets eat his canopy and plane skin; the plane
	breaks apart in mid air, spilling in gouts of flame as it
	smashes down on the tarmac.

	Rafe and Danny have reaches the more distant P-40's and are
	revving their engines as they see Joe and Theo's fate.  They
	throw on their radio headsets.

	Their way seems blocked:  they've got no runway behind them,
	the wreckage of four P-40's scattered ahead of them, and the
	Zeros screaming over the low hills to attack them.  Now Rafe
	and Danny talk through the radio.

					DANNY
			It's tight.

					RAFE
			Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season.
			Don't hit the barn.

	They gun their engines and roll through the grass on either
	side of the runway, dodging the burning planes; they lift
	off, clearing the quonset hut by a couple of inches.  They
	blow right through the strafing fire, and into the sky.

	Eight Zeros are all over them.

	Earl is in the hut, on the radio and watching through
	binoculars.

					EARL
			I see six...seven...eight of the
			cocksuckers!  Don't let 'em hurt my
			planes.

	Danny's swiveling in his seat, looking left, right, back.

					DANNY
			They're all over us!

					RAFE
			Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.

	Danny understands immediately, following Rafe's tactic as he
	breaks into a sharp turn and uses the hut, palm trees, and
	low hills to shake the Japs.  They fly like crop dusters,
	skimming down a foot from the ground, then bobbing up,
	banking left and right.  The Zeros have divided into two
	groups to chase them, their wings clipping tree tops as they
	try to follow the Americans.

	It feels like a 200 M.P.H. car chase, 20 feet off the ground,
	Rafe and Danny skimming and bobbing over the terrain, but
	there are too many Japanese.

					RAFE
			Danny!  Let's play some chicken!

	Danny banks in one direction, Rafe in another...

	EXT.  OVER THE LANDING STRIP - DAY

	The two P-40's are screaming, rushing at each other like they
	did at the training base back in the states, flying right
	into each other's propellers; the Japanese heading after them
	realize they're rushing headlong at the other group...

					EARL
			Oh shit, oh shit...

	He can't even watch.

	At the last instant Rafe and Danny snap a quarter spin so the
	planes flash by belly to belly.

	Two of the Zeros collide in mid-air, exploding, as the other
	Zeros scatter.

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Danny and Rafe rejoin each other in the open sky; they've
	lost the Zeros.  The P-40's are flying smoothly, side by
	side.  The two pilots look across at each other, going into
	battle together.  They speak through their radios.

					RAFE
			You hear my okay?

					DANNY
			Yeah.  So you can call me if you need
			help.

					RAFE
			I got a half a tank.  You?

					DANNY
			Little less.

	He fires a short burst to see if his guns work; they do.
	Rafe does the same.  Up ahead they see a formation of
	Japanese planes, headed toward Pearl.

					RAFE
			They're in strafing formation, we'll blow
			right through their line.

	They look across at each other.

					RAFE
			Land of the free.

					DANNY
			Home of the brave.

	Side by side the P-40's scream in.

	EXT.  ABOVE OAHU - THE DOGFIGHT - DAY

	The Japanese planes are in tight, disciplined formation,
	their minds on the targets below them in the harbor.  But
	their day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two P-40's
	blast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into Two Zeros.  Both
	Zeros falter and begin to lose altitude.  The P-40's make
	almost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go
	after the two plane they crippled on the first pass.

	Rafe finishes one Zero, making it explode in a ball of flame
	in the air.  Danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing
	so that it spirals into the sea and crashes there.

	The P-40's swoop up again.

					RAFE
			They're trying to hold formation.  We can
			chew 'em up!

	The P-40's dig in again, swooping down on the line of Zeros.
	Rafe hits first, machine gunning one plane, and Danny comes
	in behind it, finishing it off.

	The Japanese pilots are screaming at each other over their
	radios, but their SQUADRON COMMANDER sees Pearl Harbor ahead,
	and tells them --

					JAPANESE SQUADRON COMMANDER
			Hold the line!

	The P-40's come through again, their guns spitting fire.

	EXT.  ANOTHER JAPANESE FORMATION OF BOMBERS - DAY

	These planes are different -- high altitude bombers with
	three-man crews, high above the harbor.  The bombardier looks
	through his sight and the bomb bays open.

	THROUGH THE BOMBARDIER'S SIGHT, the ships look like tops, far
	below.  The bombardier is ticking off the targets as they
	pass, the first two he mentions already burning.

					JAPANESE BOMBARDIER
			West Virginia... Oklahoma... Ah, Arizona.

	He flips his bomb switch, and a HUGE STEEL BOMB falls away.

	EXT.  THE FLIGHT OF THE BOMB - DAY

	We stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky.  The small
	propeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the
	arming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core.  The bomb
	wobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins
	stabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying
	rate, toward the Arizona.

	It slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like
	matchsticks.

	It's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next
	deck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship...toward
	the powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are
	waiting.

	The bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond
	comprehension.  Over 1400 men die instantly.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The battleship Arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine
	is broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant.
	Men on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already
	floating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but
	there are almost no survivors.

	The concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship
	Vestal, next to the Arizona, saving Vestal, as the explosion
	snuffs out the fires on Vestal; it also sends tons of debris
	down on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads
	of men, all sorts of bodies.

	Debris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does
	more damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Medics have already started bringing in the wounded.  Evelyn
	is like a frantic traffic cop.

					EVELYN
			Put criticals in ward one, stables in
			two!  Barbara!  Fill every syringe you
			can find with stimulant and antibiotic --

					MEDIC
			Where are the doctors?

					EVELYN
			On the third tee.

					SANDRA
			Evelyn!  Where's the morphine?

	THE FRONT WARD

	Evelyn runs in, snaps open the cabinet, grabs a bag of
	morphine sticks, and is about to run out again when she sees
	the Arizona go up.

	For a moment she's frozen, then she actually sees the shock
	wave traveling across the bay and through the trees like an
	invisible wall.  She's trying to cross her arms over her
	face, and dive to the floor, just as the windows blow out
	from the concussion, and glass flies over everything.

	INT.  JAPANESE BOMBER - DAY

	They see the results of their bomb, and are ecstatic.

	EXT.  AIR ABOVE OAHU - DAY

	The nose of Danny's plane is pointed right at the harbor and
	he sees the sudden devastation of the Arizona.  It is a sight
	so awesome it freezes him for a moment.

	A Zero comes up behind him, firing.  Danny jerks his stick to
	maneuver but he's caught...

	Rafe comes in behind the Zero, chopping it up, even as he
	yells at Danny over the radio --

					RAFE
			Ain't no time for spectatin'!

	They turn back after the line of Zeros.  There are some
	Japanese planes coming after them now, but the P-40's head at
	their noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and
	turn right back into the Japanese formation.

	Rafe has a plane in his sights, but his guns fire only a
	short burst before stopping.

					RAFE
			I'm out of ammo!

					DANNY
			I'm out of fuel!

	They head back.  A single Zero is on their way.  Rafe charges
	it and draws its fire; Danny comes in behind the Zero and
	rakes its cockpit; the Japanese pilot backs off.

	The P-40's dive back toward Haleiwa.

	A handful of Zeros returning from Pearl see them and follow.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - JAPANESE CARRIERS - DAY

	The second wave of planes takes off from the carriers.

	INT.  FLIGHT CONTROL CENTER - CARRIER AKAGI - DAY

	Genda reports to Yamamoto.

					GENDA
			Second attack wave is in the air.

	INT.  RADIO STATION KGBM - DAY

	The DISC JOCKEY, handed a message by the army officer, stops
	playing the soothing Hawaiian music and announces...

					DISC JOCKEY
			All Army, Navy, and Marine personnel to
			report to duty.

	INT.  GENERAL SHORT'S OFFICE - DAY

	General SHORT is in his office; he and his aides are working
	frantically.

					GENERAL SHORT
			Mobilize everything!  We're at war!  Send
			a message to Washington:  Hostilities
			with Japan commenced with an air raid on
			Pearl Harbor.

	INT.  WHITE HOUSE - OVAL ROOM - DAY

	President Roosevelt is having lunch in the Oval Room study
	with Harry Hopkins.  The phone RINGS and Hopkins answers.

					HOPKINS
			Oval Room... Yes, he is.
				(to Roosevelt)
			It's Knox, Mr. President.

					ROOSEVELT
				(taking phone)
			Yes?

	He listens, then puts the receiver down, shaken.

					ROOSEVELT
			The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor.

					HOPKINS
			My God.  Do we have damage estimates?

					ROOSEVELT
			Our Pacific Fleet, at anchor, unprepared?
			It's terrible.  It has to be.  And it's
			not over.

	EXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY

	The two P-40's drop out of the sky and bounce to a landing;
	Anthony and Red have been pushing the wreckage off the field
	with the Buick.  Danny and Rafe pull the P-40's behind the
	burning quonset hut, and it's like a pit stop at a race
	track; Earl rushes up and starts fueling the planes, their
	engines still running.

					DANNY
			We need ammo too!

	Earl shouts instructions to the pilots.

					EARL
			Strip it from the wrecks!

	The other pilots race to the wrecked P-40's and start pulling
	out ammo belts.  Earl glares at the smoking engine of Danny's
	plane, and the bullet holes.

					EARL
			Who the fuck taught you to fly?

					DANNY
			He did.

	Earl looks at Rafe's plane, more shot-up and abused than
	Danny's.  Rafe grins and waves to him.  Earl mumbles a stream
	of guttural and unintelligible obscenities.

	The Zeros that followed them sweep down, strafing.  One
	mechanic, running across the field with a belt of ammo, goes
	down.  Coma, running behind him, picks up the fallen man's
	ammo and his own, bringing both to the planes behind the hut.
	He, Red, and Anthony reload the machine guns in Rafe and
	Danny's planes.

	Rafe and Danny gun their engines and head back into the air,
	the grounded pilots firing a covering barrage and Earl even
	coming up with a 12-gauge shotgun to fire at the Zeros as
	they rush past.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - DAY

	The Second Wave of Japanese planes is in tight formation.

	INT.  LEAD PLANE OF SECOND WAVE - DAY

	Lt. Commander SHIMAZAKI, leader of the second attack wave,
	says calmly into his radio...

					SHIMAZAKI
			Second wave, deploy over the military
			bases.  High level bombers to the air
			stations, dive bombers attack ships in
			harbor.  Fighters strafe and cover.

	He leads the second wave in on their attack run...

	EXT.  NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

	The navy's planes, bunched up on the naval airfield, are
	destroyed without ever getting into the air.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The harbor is already a mass of destruction and panic;
	screaming everywhere, men trying to fight fires, move the
	wounded; the second wave of planes hits, and tremendous
	explosions now rock the secondary ships like the destroyer
	SHAW, blasting it apart.

	But the Japanese pilots are now having trouble with the thick
	black smoke coming out of the damaged ships, and off the oil
	fires along the water.  One torpedo plane, its pilot flying
	blind, clips the superstructure of a battleship and spins to
	a crash.

	Still, even IN THE CHAOS ON THE SHIPS, the sailors struggle
	to survive, inventively.  Men trapped on one burning ship use
	the severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to
	cross to the less damaged ship anchored beside them.

	Others jump into the water and swim through the burning oil,
	towing buddies too wounded to swim themselves.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Below decks, sailors have organized a line and are passing
	ammunition from the ammo lockers, hand to hand up to the guns
	on deck.  Blasts from bombs hit them and ignite the ammo
	they're holding, setting off a chain reaction of explosions.

	On the deck, the sailors are out of ammo.  An OFFICER grabs a
	SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SAILOR.

					OFFICER
			Grab a dinghy and get ammo from the base
			ammo storeroom.

	The young sailor jumps to a dinghy and launches it through
	the oily waters and thick black smoke.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The sailors in the boat get strafed, the rounds cutting
	between them and blasting their boat in two.  They jump into
	the oily water and swim toward shore.

	Other sailors are in the water with them, struggling,
	swallowing the vile black liquid as they battle to swim.
	Errant bombs and shrapnel hit beside them, killing some;
	other lose strength and slide beneath the surface.

	The sailors from the ammo boat make it ashore; it's hot there
	too, with bullets and bombs all around.  One sailor has to
	stop and puke from the oil; his buddy grabs him and they run
	for cover; they find it in the dugout of the baseball
	diamond.

	EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

	A MARINE GUNNERY SERGEANT leads men in a race through
	strafing fire to the bases ammo storeroom.

	INT.  AMMO STOREROOM - DAY

	The SUPPLY SERGEANT is at his post.

					GUNNERY SERGEANT
			We need weapons and ammo!

					SUPPLY SERGEANT
			You need authorization.

					GUNNERY SERGEANT
			The fuck I do!

	He pushes the man out of the way and starts grabbing weapons.

	EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

	The gunnery sergeant and his marines run with a water-cooled
	machine gun, across the open ground, under fire.

	BARRACKS

	The Marines set up in the windows of their already-strafed
	barracks, and start firing there, as the Zeros scream past.

	EXT.  NAVAL STATION - DAY

	Trucks are moving dependents -- women and children -- from
	the dependents' housing area.  The Japanese strafe the
	trucks, dependents diving for cover.

	NAVAL STATION

	A fire engine from the Honolulu Fire Department races up to
	the sight of buildings burning from the air attack.  As the
	firemen jump out, a Zero strafes them, gunning down the
	firemen.

	As the strafing Zero starts to bank away, two P-40's come in
	behind it, both of them gunning away.  The Zero comes apart
	under the barrage, and crashes in a ball of flame.

	It's Rafe and Danny, back in the air.

	INT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - DAY

	The once-pristine hospital with its glowing white beds is now
	a bloody chaos.  Every bed is already full; there are burned
	and broken people on the floor -- soldiers, sailors,
	civilians, firemen, all mixed in together.  People are dying
	everywhere, and screaming in pain, or moaning and begging for
	help.  At first we don't see Evelyn, and wonder if she
	survived the glass; then we see her, flecks of her own blood
	dotting her face and arms.  The blood of soldiers on her
	surgical apron.  A steel calm has replaced her earlier
	frenzy, even as the other nurses are breaking down.

					SANDRA
			I can't tell who's gotten morphine and
			who hasn't!

					EVELYN
			Take a grease pencil and mark an M on the
			forehead of everyone you stick.

	A young doctor is trying to give an intravenous injection to
	a man who's badly charred; the doctors hands are shaking.

					EVELYN
			Don't look for a vein, just poke.

					SANDRA
			My pen's dry!

					EVELYN
			Use lipstick.  Use ammo belts for
			tourniquets, use your own nylons if you
			have to!  Barbara!  Grab anything that
			will hold a pint of blood and sterilize
			it.

	The doctors are amputating limbs right there in the hallway.
	A SENIOR DOCTOR calls --

					SENIOR DOCTOR
			Evelyn!  You have to do the triage!
			They're bringing them in with trucks!

	Evelyn moves to the door.  Trucks are pulling up, loaded with
	the wounded, young terrified soldiers bringing them inside;
	Evelyn does quick triage as they pass.

					EVELYN
			Critical -- front ward!... Give him
			morphine, he can't wait...

	The next body through is a pilot, wings on his uniform, his
	chest riddled with bullets -- and his face shot off.  For a
	moment Evelyn falters, then she forces herself to check the
	dog tags...

	It isn't Rafe or Danny.  Evelyn sags in guilty relief.

					EVELYN
			Take him outside and cover him; he's
			dead.

	She steadies herself as the next body comes through, a woman
	on a stretcher, her stomach shot open, pale hands clutching
	at the open wound.  Evelyn feels for a pulse.

					EVELYN
			She's gone too, take her --

	It's Betty.

	And though the bombs are blasting and guns booming
	everywhere, the world goes silent for Evelyn.

	One of the sailors outside the door is pointing to the
	harbor, the Nevada has begun to move.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The battleship NEVADA is underway, plowing through the
	harbor, as the water erupts with bombs.

	INT.  THE NEVADA'S BRIDGE - DAY

	The Captain is struggling to save his ship.

					CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA
			We can save her if we make the open sea!

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - POV THE ATTACKING PLANES - DAY

	The lead pilot in the next squad of Japanese planes spots the
	moving battleship, and leads his squadron on it.

	They come whipping in over the waves, dropping torpedoes and
	bombs.

	INT.  THE NEVADA'S BRIDGE - DAY

	The Nevada's Captain feels the ship shudder as it takes hits
	amidships.

					CAPTAIN OF THE NEVADA
			We're not gonna make it -- and if we go
			down here we block the channel... Beach
			her, there!

	His officers relay the order to the helm, and the ship's
	rudder turns as more blasts rip her hull.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	The Nevada swings off its course and runs aground.

	INT.  THE NEVADA'S DYNAMO ROOM - DAY

	The impact jolts the boilers, already bursting with the steam
	pressure; gouts of steam from rupturing pipes scalds and
	blinds the engine room crew.

	EXT.  THE NEVADA - DAY

	The Nevada, run aground at the shoreline, is now like a beast
	cut from the herd; the predators swarm after it with
	torpedoes and bombs.

	One torpedo, missing the Nevada, skims right up the beach
	itself and blasts a house on the shore to fragments.

	Bombs detonate along the Nevada, engulfing the entire upper
	deck in flames, ravaging the sailors.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

	The Nevada is grounded near the hospital; from the doorway
	Evelyn can see the whole ship on fire, burning sailors
	leaping off the decks.  Her hearing, her presence of mind,
	returns; she lets Betty go, and grabs an ORDERLY.

					EVELYN
			Go to the base hardware store and get
			some of those canister spray things they
			use for killing bugs.

					ORDERLY
			Insecticide?...

					EVELYN
			No, just the sprayers.  We'll fill them
			with tannic acid, it'll sterilize them
			and cool the burns!  GO!

	The orderly races away.  They can still hear the bombs
	falling outside.

	A sailor staggers toward the hospital from the Nevada.  He is
	completely gray.  Everyone stares at him, and then realizes
	he is nude, burned gray, his skin ash.

	Evelyn rushes to help him, shouting back over her shoulder to
	the other nurses --

					EVELYN
			We're gonna need every bed.  If they can
			breathe, make 'em get up and move
			someplace else!

	EXT.  JAPANESE CARRIER - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

	The first wave of planes lands on the carrier.  The flight
	leader rushes to the bridge.

	INT.  JAPANESE CARRIER - BRIDGE - DAY

	Yamamoto's advisors are exultant.

					GENDA
			We have achieved complete surprise!  The
			first wave is returning, the second is
			attacking now, and we have lost only a
			few planes.  We can launch a third wave,
			Admiral.

					YAMAMOTO
			The second wave has not returned.  And we
			have no idea where their carriers are.
			What is the damage report?

					COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
			We have Commander Fuchida on the radio
			now, Admiral.

	Yamamoto nods and Fuchida's voice comes over the intercom.

					FUCHIDA'S VOICE
			I am over the harbor now...

	EXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Fuchida is in a scout plane, high over Pearl.  His vision is
	hampered by the thick black smoke, but he can tell there has
	been awesome devastation.  He uses a diagram of the ships at
	anchor to note the damage to each ship.

					FUCHIDA
				(into radio)
			We have a tremendous victory.  Many ships
			damaged, some totally destroyed.  But the
			Second Wave's attack is being hindered by
			the smoke.

	INT.  WAR ROOM OF THE AKAGI - DAY

					YAMAMOTO
			The more we attack, the harder it is to
			find targets.  And we no longer have
			surprise.

					GENDA
			If we launch the third wave and
			annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy
			their ability to operate in the Pacific
			for at least a year!

					YAMAMOTO
			And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we
			destroy our ability to fight them at all.
				(beat)
			As soon as the second wave returns, we
			will withdraw.

	EXT.  JAPANESE CARRIER AKAGI - DAY

	The last planes touch down, and the lead carrier and the
	other ships in the Japanese assault fleet turn back toward
	home.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - DAY

	The harbor is a place of shattered bodies and shattered
	ships.  Blood, body parts, debris everywhere, and all of it
	made more hellish by the oil fires on the water and the
	choking black smoke those fires produce.

	Every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher
	bearer, medic, iron worker.  They fish men from the water,
	extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships.
	Everyone is screaming and yelling -- the wounded for help,
	the helpers for more help.

	Local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the water
	mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base
	swimming pool toward the burning ships.

	The PHOTOGRAPHER records this with his black-and-white film
	camera.  He is shaken, and yet he understands the magnitude
	of what he is recording -- the loss of America's innocence.

	EXT.  ARMY BASE - AFTERMATH - DAY

	In one place, outside a barracks, soldiers hit by the bombs
	are just becoming conscious.  One of them comes to.

					CONSCIOUS SOLDIER
			Sarge?!  Where are you, Sarge?

	He's crawling around toward the bushes; his legs are
	shattered, but he's spotted a body.  He reaches it, turns it
	over -- and it's headless.

	He turns away in horror...and finds himself staring at the
	severed head.

	The medics appear.

					MEDIC
			We've got two more over here!

	EXT.  GENERAL SHORT'S OFFICE - DAY

	The Western Union messenger, Tadao Fuchikami, delivers the
	telegram from Washington.

	INT.  GENERAL SHORT'S OFFICE - DAY

	Short and his staff are assessing damage.

					SHORT
			I want lookouts and sentries everywhere,
			with orders to shoot first and ask
			questions later.

					COLONEL
			You think an invasion possible, General?

					SHORT
			After this morning, we better not
			consider anything impossible.

	An aide hands Short the telegram.  He reads it --

					SHORT
			From Washington.  "Intelligence reports
			an ultimatum from Japan to be given
			precisely at one p.m.  Washington time.
			Just what significance the hour set may
			have we do not know, but be on alert
			accordingly."

	The irony is bitter in his throat.

	EXT.  JAPANESE EMBASSY - OAHU - DAY

	The Honolulu police roar up to the embassy in squad cars, and
	burst through the doors.

	INT.  JAPANESE EMBASSY - OAHU - DAY

	The police storm through the embassy and find the Japanese
	there burning documents.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - DAY

	Divers are going down, trying to save the trapped men.  But
	the tangle of the Arizona is horrific.  One diver gets
	trapped, and another tries to extricate him, and the steel
	shifts and falls on them both.

	ON THE DECK OF BOMB-SHATTERED BATTLESHIP, a naval CAPTAIN
	oversees rescue efforts.  The 17-year-old sailor he sent off
	for ammo now approaches him, with great concern.

					SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD SAILOR
			Sir, I...I lost the dinghy.

	The captain looks out over the wreckage, great battleships
	devastated in every direction.

					CAPTAIN
			Well, son, we won't worry about the
			dinghy today.

	EXT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Danny and Rafe arrive at the hospital.  Their fears of what
	they might find aren't helped when they see the stairs into
	the hospital covered in blood.

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny enter.  It's a scene from hell.  Doctors are
	doing amputations in the hallway.  The once-pristine hospital
	is now all red, with blood dripping through the mattresses,
	onto the floor...

	In the main ward, Evelyn and the other nurses are using the
	fly sprayers to spritz cooling antiseptic on the charred
	bodies.  Evelyn looks up and sees both Rafe and Danny.  Her
	eyes register relief, but they are the only part of her that
	can show emotion now; the rest of her is covered in blood.
	Rafe and Danny move to her.

					RAFE
			How can we help?

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny sit quietly as Evelyn adjusts the tubes
	conducting blood from their arms into sterilized Coke bottles
	for transfusion.

					RAFE
			What else can we do?

					EVELYN
			There's nothing you can do here, they'll
			die or they won't, we just --

	She stops, afraid if she says more, she'll lose grip on her
	emotions.  She can see the wreckage out in the harbor.

					EVELYN
			There was a sailor, a black man on the
			West Virginia, named Dorie Miller.  I'd
			like to know if he's alive.

	She goes back to her work.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	Rafe and Danny hop from the ambulance in which they've
	hitched a ride to the harbor.  They see the awful
	devastation.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

	Rafe and Danny reach the West Virginia's pier, but in the
	darkness, they can't find anything.  They stop a NAVAL
	OFFICER.

					DANNY
			Where is the West Virginia?

					OFFICER
			There.

	He points; the battleship has sunk, its superstructure barely
	showing above the water.

	It looks hopeless to find a single sailor here; but then they
	see a powerful black sailor, pulling to the dock with a
	dinghy full of dead men retrieved from the water.  As workers
	unload the bodies, the black sailor sits down, exhausted
	physically and emotionally, his head in his hands.  Rafe and
	Danny approach him.

					DANNY
			We're looking for Dorie Miller.

					DORIE
			That's me, Sir.

					RAFE
			A friend of ours wanted to be sure you're
			alive.  Evelyn.  A nurse.

					DORIE
			How is she?

					DANNY
			Like we all are.

	Miller nods, and looks out over the harbor, a hellish place
	where black smoke still hangs over everything, the shattered
	remains of men and ships still in the harbor.  It's total
	devastation.  And yet something about that scene stirs
	something else in Dorie Miller.

					DORIE
			There's something out there I need to
			get.  Will you help me?

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AFTERMATH - NIGHT

	Dorie pilots the dinghy through the floating debris.  Rafe
	and Danny sit with him.  He stops over a dangerous pile of
	superstructure wreckage.

					DORIE
			The Arizona.  Hold the dinghy steady, so
			it doesn't bust open.

	Rafe and Danny brace the dinghy so it doesn't move; but they
	still don't see what Dorie is after as he fishes down in the
	water, for something barely at the surface; he works for a
	moment, then pulls it up.

	It's the oil-soaked flag of the Arizona.

	EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

	Men are working through the night to save the sailors trapped
	in the hull.

	INT.  OKLAHOMA - THE TRAPPED SAILORS

	are in total darkness.  From it we hear GASPING, then --

					SAILOR
			What's that?

	The light comes on and sweeps around the faces.  The water is
	up to their chests, but it's stopped rising.

					SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
			Just hand on.  They'll find us.

					SAILOR
			How do you know?

					SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
			Because we would find them.

	He switches the light off again.

	EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

	The welders are cutting away, the torches sending showers of
	sparks everywhere.

	INT.  OKLAHOMA - THE TRAPPED SAILORS

	They are gasping, running out of air.

					SAILOR FLASHLIGHT
			Breathe easy.  Stay calm.

					SAILOR
			You hear something?

	Something stirs in the ship; a noise...from where?  Then a
	point of light; sparks fly into the room; somebody's cutting
	through the wall.  And the sparks illuminate faces suddenly
	filled with hope.

	But as the cut enlarges, the trapped air, compressed by the
	water, starts rushing out -- and the water starts rising
	again.  The trapped sailors hope turns to terror.

					SAILOR
			It's letting out air, and letting in
			water!

	The steel circle pops out, and they knock the welders down in
	their hurry to escape.

	Some of the sailors who were trapped are naked.  They fight
	their way toward the escape hole cut into the hull, assisted
	by rescue workers.

	EXT.  HULL OF OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

	The trapped sailors emerge, and they can barely take in the
	devastation.  Destroyed ships everywhere, the smoking
	wreckage... The rescued sailors gaze around them in shock.
	They are shivering, and other sailors put blankets around
	them.

	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	The entire Washington press corps is waiting, with fresh
	bulbs in the flash attachments of cameras that are already as
	big as a shoe box.  The President is wheeled out of the White
	House, and not a single photographer takes a picture...not
	yet.

	Aides help Roosevelt from the chair, and the press people all
	see the President struggle on legs that have no strength, to
	the podium.  His aides lock the steel clasps at the knees of
	his braces into place, and the President stands at the
	microphone.  And suddenly, from the front, Roosevelt looks
	powerful, even majestic.

	Now all the bulbs pop and flash.  He looks into the cameras.

					ROOSEVELT
			Yesterday, December 7, 1941 -- a date
			which will live in infamy -- the United
			States of American was suddenly and
			deliberately attacked by naval and air
			forces of the Empire of Japan.

	OVER THIS, we see the bombing, the aftermath, the bodies
	being fished from the oil-soaked harbor.

					ROOSEVELT
			The distance of Hawaii from Japan makes
			it obvious that the attacks was planned
			many days or even weeks ago.  During the
			intervening time the Japanese Government
			has deliberately sought to deceive the
			United States by false statements and
			expressions of hope for continued peace.

	EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

	The Japanese fleet steams back toward Japan.  The young
	officers are exultant...but Yamamoto is pensive.

					ROOSEVELT
			...I regret to tell you that many
			American lives have been lost.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

	We see rows of bodies outside the hospital where Evelyn
	works.

	The mess hall has been converted to a silent morgue, with
	bodies on every table.

					ROOSEVELT
			Yesterday the Japanese Government also
			launched an attack against Malaya.  Last
			night Japanese forces attacked Hong
			Kong... Guam...

	OVER THIS, EXT.  ISLANDS - NIGHT

	We see Japanese planes bombing islands, and soldiers
	attacking amphibious landings.

					ROOSEVELT
			...the Philippine Islands... Wake
			Island... And this morning the Japanese
			attacked Midway Island.

	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

					ROOSEVELT
			The facts speak for themselves.  With
			confidence in our armed forces -- with
			the unbounding determination of our
			people -- we will gain the inevitable
			triumph -- so help us God.  I ask that
			the Congress declare that since the
			unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan
			on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of
			war --

	The words echoes out across America --

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			War...war...war...

	It rings through the radios of farm houses, to country boys
	gathered round; in the pool halls of big cities; in the fire
	houses and high schools...

	THE LINES AT RECRUITING STATIONS all across America -- men
	line up faster than the recruiters can handle them.

	INT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	Roosevelt meets with his advisors.

					ROOSEVELT
			Gentlemen, the crisis we face is not the
			fact that our enemies believe they can
			defeat us -- it's the fact that our people
			believe it too.  I want a plan -- a
			workable plan -- to hit the heart of
			Japan, to bomb them the way they have
			bombed us.

					ADMIRAL
			Mr. President, Pearl Harbor caught us
			because we didn't face facts.  This isn't
			a time for ignoring them again.  There
			are no planes in the entire American
			arsenal capable of covering the distance
			to Japan from any land base we control
			while carrying enough bombs to do any
			damage whatsoever.

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			He's right, Mr. President.  The Army has
			long range bombers, but no place to
			launch them from.  Midway's too far,
			China is overrun by Japanese forces, and
			Russia refuses to go to war with Japan
			and won't allow us to launch a raid from
			there.

					ADMIRAL
			The navy's planes are small, carry light
			loads, and have short range.  We would
			have to get them within a few hundred
			miles of Japan, and therefore risk our
			carriers.  And if we lose our carriers,
			we have no shield against invasion.

					ROOSEVELT
			What if the Japanese did invade?

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			We've done studies.  We're confident we
			would turn them back eventually...after
			they'd gotten as far as Chicago.

					ADMIRAL
			Mr. President...with all respect...what
			you are asking can't be done.

	Roosevelt places his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and
	struggles to lift himself.  Aides jump to help him, but he
	waves them off.  With inhuman physical effort, that has his
	neck veins bulging and sweat popping on his face, Roosevelt
	stands on his withered legs.

					ROOSEVELT
			Do not tell me...it can't be done.

	EXT.  PEARL HARBOR - HICKAM BASE - DAY

	There is a mass memorial service going on, with caskets
	draped in flags.

	There are also coffins covered in Japanese flags, their
	drowned fliers being treated now with respect.

	Everyone is in their best uniforms.  The pilots -- Rafe,
	Danny, and the other guys -- are looking at Billy's coffin;
	Evelyn, next to Danny, on his appropriate side is looking at
	one that belongs to Betty.  So is Red; he's grieving.

					MINISTER
			...Where is God in this?  Our enemies
			believe a divine wind protects them.  We
			see our friends laid out before us, and
			find it hard to believe in anything at
			all.

	Rafe and Evelyn exchange a glance, past Danny.

					MINISTER
			Though we cannot understand why our
			friends should die while we live, we can
			affirm our truest selves in our belief
			that any God worth divinity would choose
			both justice and mercy, and would take
			these fallen brothers and sisters into
			eternal peace.  Amen.

	As the mourners disperse, Evelyn puts a lei on Betty's
	casket; Red does the same, then breaks down beside Danny.  As
	Danny comforts him, Evelyn moves to Rafe.

					EVELYN
			Rafe --

					RAFE
			I need to tell you something.  I didn't
			know what it was to lose somebody, to see
			death and find how much it scares you.
			That you haven't lived and loved enough.
			I didn't understand.  Forgive me.

					EVELYN
			Rafe... No.  You forgive me.

					RAFE
			Of course I forgive you.  I know what you
			feel for Danny is real.  And your choice
			is your choice.

					EVELYN
			That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It
			wasn't a choice.  It --

	An Army Corps MAJOR steps up and interrupts.

					MAJOR
			Lieutenant Rafe McCawley?

					RAFE
			Yes, Major.

					MAJOR
			Lieutenant Daniel Walker here too?

	Danny sees him and moves up.

					DANNY
			I'm Walker.

					MAJOR
			You're going Stateside.  We fly out in
			half an hour.

	He hands them both orders.

					RAFE
			What for, Sir?

					MAJOR
			Ask Colonel Doolittle.  Those orders are
			from him.

	EXT.  HICKAM FIELD - DAY

	The wrecked planes have been pushed off the runway and lie in
	piles.  A transport plane is fueling, and Rafe and Danny wait
	in the shade of a shelter.

					DANNY
			I told her not to come.

	The Major, watching the fueling, gets a wave from the ground
	crew and turns and motions to Rafe and Danny that they're
	ready.  They pick up their duffel bags -- and then Evelyn
	comes around the corner of the shelter.

	Rafe sees her first, but stops and looks away as Danny moves
	to her.  For a moment he studies her eyes, and she does not
	look away.

					DANNY
			This hasn't been easy for any of us.  I
			feel awful for how it's happened.  But
			I've seen my first spring too.  Thanks
			for knowing that's true.

	He takes her into his arms, kisses her tenderly but briefly,
	a final time.  Evelyn's eyes find Rafe, but he can't look at
	her until the embrace is over.

	Rafe and Danny move to the plane and hurry up the steps.
	They turn before the door closes and wave to her.

	Evelyn's still standing there as the plane lifts away.

	INT.  U.S. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT

	The transport has landed and taxied right to the door of a
	low, dark bunker, mostly underground.  The Major leads Rafe
	and Danny inside.

	INT.  BUNKER

	Rafe and Danny follow the Major down a spartan corridor; the
	whole place reeks of secrecy.

	INT.  BUNKER - SECRECY ROOM - NIGHT

	The Major opens the door for Rafe and Danny, then leaves,
	closing it behind him.  Doolittle is alone at a desk.  Rafe
	and Danny walk in and salute.  Doolittle motions to the two
	chairs in front of the desk without looking up from the
	papers he's studying.

					DOOLITTLE
			I heard what you did.

					RAFE
			We can explain, Colonel.

					DOOLITTLE
			Explain what?

					DANNY
			Whatever is was you heard about us.

					DOOLITTLE
			You mean the hula shirts you were flying
			in?... Or the six planes you shot down?
			You're both being awarded the Silver
			Star, and promoted to captain.

					RAFE
			Is that the good new, Sir, or --

					DOOLITTLE
			You're just about the only pilots in the
			Army with actual combat experience, so
			you're volunteering for a mission I've
			been ordered to put together.  Do you
			know what top secret is?

					RAFE
			Well sure, Colonel --

					DOOLITTLE
			Top secret means you help me pick the
			other pilots, train, and go -- without
			knowing where you're going until it's too
			late.

					DANNY
			You can count on us.

					DOOLITTLE
			There's only one other thing I can tell
			you.

	Doolittle looks up from his paperwork for the first time.
	His eyes are fierce.

					DOOLITTLE
			You won't need any goddamn hula shirts.

	EXT.  ESTABLISHING EGLIN FIELD, FLORIDA - DAY

	Eglin Field is on the gulf coast of Florida.

	INT.  BRIEFING ROOM - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	A room full of PILOTS are assembled, with and other CREWMEN.
	Danny and Rafe are there; Red and Anthony too.

					VOICE
			Attention!

	Colonel Doolittle strides into the room as all the men snap
	to attention.

					DOOLITTLE
			Be seated.  The mission you've
			volunteered for is dangerous.  How
			dangerous?  Look at the man beside you.
			It's a good bet that six weeks from now,
			either you or he will be dead.

	Danny and Rafe whisper to each other --

					DANNY
			Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna
			make it.

					RAFE
			What color flowers you want me to bring
			to your funeral?

					DOOLITTLE
			In flight school you qualified in single
			and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be
			flying multi-engines here.

					RAFE
				(whispering)
			Bombers.

					DOOLITTLE
			I want to introduce a couple of people.
			Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has
			volunteered for gunnery training so that
			he can go on the mission, because we
			can't spare the weight of an extra man.

					DANNY
				(whispering)
			A long range bomber mission.

					DOOLITTLE
			...And Ross Greening, who will oversee
			your equipment.  Any questions?

					DANNY
			Who'll be the first one in, Colonel?  I'd
			like to volunt --

	Rafe elbows his ribs so hard it takes his breath away.

					DOOLITTLE
			I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not
			just putting this mission together -- I'm
			leading it myself.

					RAFE
			I take it back, about the flowers.  We're
			all gonna die.

	EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - RUNWAY - DAY

	CLOSE - A B-25 bomber, from different angles.

	The pilots look them over, liking what they see.

					DOOLITTLE
			This is what we'll fly -- the B-25.
			There's one thing you have to be aware of
			from the very beginning.  You see that
			private?

	They look down the runway a few hundred feet.  A private
	waves, and starts painting a red line across the runway.
	Another private, close by, paints a green line.

					DOOLITTLE
			Green means go.  Red means dead.

	MONTAGE - THE TRAINING - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	The pilots practice takeoff's.  Red is Rafe's copilot;
	Anthony is Danny's.  Nobody can get airborne before the red
	line.

	INT.  EGLIN FIELD - LECTURE ROOM - DAY

	Doolittle is instructing the men.

					DOOLITTLE
			You're having trouble getting airborne in
			the shorter space because you're not
			revving the engines enough.  You've got
			to push them to the limit before you ever
			start to move.

	Rafe is distracted; he's lost in though, looking at Danny --
	and looks away just before Danny realizes it.

	MONTAGE CONTINUES - EXT.  EGLIN FIELD RUNWAY - DAY

	Pilots practice hard, revving the engines, taking off
	hard...all of them crossing the red line, takeoff after
	takeoff.  Rafe pushes his engine hard and still crosses by
	twenty feet; Danny pushes even harder, and misses by ten
	feet.

	Doolittle watches with Greening from the edge of the runway.

					DOOLITTLE
			We've got to get the weight down.

	INT.  HANGER - EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	Greening has removed the intensely complex Norden sight from
	a bomber and put in on a table for Doolittle.

					GREENING
			Okay, forty pounds gone.  And in it's
			place, this.

	He shows Doolittle an aluminum strip on a swivel.

					GREENING
			Weight, 3 ounces.  Cost, 20 cents.

					DOOLITTLE
			Does it work?

	EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - DAY

	Doolittle pilots a B-25 at treetop level onto a practice
	bombing range.  Greening uses the makeshift sight, and drops
	a 500-lb sack of flour, right in the middle of the bull's-eye
	target chalked on the ground.

	EXT.  FLORIDA COAST - DAY

	The B-25's are practicing, flying at treetop level.  Red is
	Rafe's copilot, Anthony is Danny's.  Doolittle is flying the
	lead bomber.

					DOOLITTLE
			Right down to the treetops.  Low as you
			can.

	Rafe brings his plane down, smoothly.  Then Danny's plane
	appears -- under him.  Rafe jerks his nose up quickly.
	Rafe's angry; Danny's laughing -- but he scares the shit out
	of his crew.

	EXT.  EGLIN FIELD - NIGHT

	Danny's outside, looking up at the moon.  Rafe appears and
	moves up beside him.

					DANNY
			Fun today.  Like old times.

					RAFE
			Danny, what the hell are you trying to do
			out there?

					DANNY
			What do you mean?  I'm just doing what
			we've always done.

					RAFE
			No.  You're trying to beat me.

					DANNY
			We've always tried to beat each other.

					RAFE
			Bullshit.  We've played with each other,
			pushed each other.  This is different.
			Like you want to prove that you're
			better than me.  Who's that for --
			Evelyn?

	Danny's anger flares for a moment -- but Rafe's hit home.

					DANNY
			Maybe just trying to measure up.

					RAFE
			What's between you and her is between you
			and her.  But here's what's between you
			and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny.
			And you're mine.

	Danny's caught off-guard.

					RAFE
			When we were growing up, I had
			everything.  You had nothing.  You
			climbed out of a hole I couldn't even see
			the bottom of.  I think maybe when I went
			off to England, I was trying to measure
			up to you.  Measuring up's over.  Let's
			just look out for each other.  Okay?

	They embrace, closer now than ever.

	MONTAGE - INTERCUT

	with the planes practicing their short takeoffs, we see
	Roosevelt in one of his fireside chats, his voice broadcast
	across America...

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			Good evening, America...

	Families all across America are gathered around radios,
	listening.

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			I'm told that 80% of American families
			are listening to these fireside chats of
			ours, and I'm happy we can come together,
			as one great American family.  I'd like
			each of you within the sound of my voice
			to find a map...

	The FAMILIES do, gathering around encyclopedias, school
	books, any reference they have, spread on kitchen tables,
	suburban living room rugs, or farmhouse hearths...

	And the B-25's, all sixteen of them, begin a journey in
	formation, flying at treetop level across America:
	Mississippi delta land, Texas plains, Arizona mesas...

					ROOSEVELT'S VOICE
			Look at the Pacific Ocean.  It covers
			half the surface of the earth.  And look
			at the great Atlantic.  The oceans both
			divide and connect us to our enemies, and
			either they will come to us, or we will
			go to them...

	The formation of B-25's reaches San Francisco.

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

	Doolittle leads the bombers to a landing.  IN RAFE'S PLANE,
	everybody's wondering why they're here.

					RED
			N-naval station?  What's g-going on?

					RAFE
			Wish I knew, Red.

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO AIR FIELD - DAY

	The crews climb from their planes, and almost before they're
	out, teams of men use straps and cranes to hoist the bombers
	onto flatbed trucks.  Doolittle walks up to Rafe and Danny,
	watching the baffling operation.

					DOOLITTLE
			Want to see where they're going?

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - EVENING

	Cranes lift the planes from the trucks and hoist them onto
	the flight decks of the carrier USS HORNET.  The pilots stand
	on the pier, watching.

					ANTHONY
			I guess that settles it.  Somewhere in
			the Pacific.

					RED
			With a s-short r-runway.

	They all gather around Doolittle as he moves up to them.

					DOOLITTLE
			You have rooms at the Biltmore.  I
			suggest a nice meal and a good night's
			sleep.  We leave tomorrow.

	Doolittle walks to join a captain.

	INT./ EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL - NIGHT

	The pilots get off the bus and carry their duffels into the
	lobby.

					ANTHONY
			San Francisco, here we are!

					DANNY
				(grinning)
			I don't reckon we can get hogbrains and
			grits, but I hear a man can eat good in
			this town.

					RAFE
			I'm gonna turn in.  I hate being on the
			water.  I think this is the last sleep
			I'll get for awhile.

	INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT

	The other guys drop their duffels with the bell hops; Rafe
	moves to the reception desk.

					RAFE
			McCawley.

	The manager hands him a key, and smiles curiously.

					MANAGER
			Have fun.

	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Rafe enters his room and finds the light on...and Evelyn's
	there waiting.

					RAFE
			What?...

					EVELYN
			They were bringing back a ship full of
			wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I
			wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I
			needed to see you before you go.

					RAFE
			It must of been a convincing letter.

					EVELYN
			It was.  I couldn't have you go away,
			wherever it is...to war...without knowing
			something.  You think I made a choice, of
			Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have
			a choice.  I'm pregnant.

	The blood drains from Rafe's heart.  Yet he finds the
	strength to move to her.  She turns away, so she won't throw
	her arms around him.

					RAFE
			Does Danny know?

	She shakes her head, refuses to cry.

					EVELYN
			I wasn't sure, until the day you turned
			up alive.  I never had a chance to tell
			him.  Now I can't have him thinking about
			this when he needs to be thinking about
			his mission, and how to come back from
			it.

	She turns and faces him again.

					EVELYN
			I want you thinking about that too.  Just
			come back.
				(beat)
			Rafe, I see it in your face.  You're
			thinking you don't have anything to live
			for.  Don't you dare think that way.
			I'll never write a letter, or look at a
			sunset, without thinking of you.  I'll
			love you my whole life.  And I want you
			to live.

	She looks at him, her eyes bright with tears, but still she
	refuses to cry.  They both know they can't touch, or they'll
	never let go.  She walks past him, out of the room, closing
	the door softly behind her.

	EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - DAY

	The USS HORNET clears the Golden Gate Bridge, with cruisers
	and destroyers rounding out its battle group.

	Rafe and Danny stand on the flight deck, watching the city
	recede behind them.

	Evelyn is on a hilltop watching them go.  Danny can't see
	her, doesn't know she's there.  Rafe can't see her either --
	but he knows.

					SHIP'S INTERCOM
			Army pilots to the briefing room.

	INT.  THE CARRIER HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	The pilots are gathered expectantly in the carrier's
	conference room.  Doolittle strides in.

					DOOLITTLE
			Gentlemen, I can now tell you that the
			target of this mission is Tokyo.

	The pilots love it.  The ones who have not seen battle are
	grinning and vocal.  Rafe, Danny, Anthony, and Red are
	quieter, savoring the prospect of revenge.

					RED
			And where's the secret base, Sir?  The
			one we t-takeoff from.

					DOOLITTLE
			The navy will get us to within 400 miles
			of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off
			the carriers from there.

	Suddenly the pilots don't like the sound of this.

					ANTHONY
			Sir, has this ever been done, launching
			an army bomber off a navy carrier?

					DOOLITTLE
			No.  Any other questions?

					RED
			C-Colonel, we been p-practicing
			takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land
			on these carriers d-decks.

					DOOLITTLE
			We won't have the fuel to get back to the
			carriers; they'll turn and run back to
			Hawaii the minute we're airborne.

					RED
			Then wh-where do we land?

					DOOLITTLE
			I have a phrase I want you all to
			memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It
			means "I am an American."  In Chinese.

	Absolute silence among the pilots.

	EXT.  FLIGHT DECK OF THE HORNET - DAY

	The sailors who man the flight deck look at each other with
	bafflement as the worried pilots pace from one end of the
	deck to the other.  They're in a line like ducks, Rafe in the
	lead and the others following, counting steps, each man
	measuring the distance.  Shaking their heads, worrying.

	They stop at the end and look down at the sea far below them;
	it's dizzying.  Anthony shoves Red for fun before grabbing
	his shoulder to stop him from falling.

					RED
			A-a-asshole!... Maybe it's l-longer
			going this way.

	He starts pacing back the other way, as if the ship's longer
	in that direction.  The other pilots watch him for a moment,
	then follow him, counting again.

	Rafe and Danny are left standing alone at the end of the
	flight deck.  Far over the surging sea.

					DANNY
			It's shorter than our practice runway.

					RAFE
			They'll turn the ship into the wind
			before we launch.  That'll help.

					DANNY
			We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of
			bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got
			another Chinese phrase for Doolittle.
			"Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It
			means "Who the fuck thought up this
			shit?"

	Doolittle appears right beside them.

					DOOLITTLE
			He was a navy man.

	Doolittle walks away.

					RAFE
			Maybe we'll be lucky with the weather.

								SMASH TO:

	EXT.  PACIFIC - A FEROCIOUS STORM - NIGHT

	The Hornet tosses, bashed by a vicious storm.

	INT.  CARRIER HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	The ships is rolling; most of the fliers are green.
	Doolittle stands at the podium.

					DOOLITTLE
			Since we'll be on our own once we're in
			the air, I thought I had a good idea
			letting each crew select it's own target.

	He looks at a pile of paper slips in front of him.

					DOOLITTLE
			Now we have fifteen requests for the
			Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo
			baseball stadium.

					RED
			I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed
			to p-play baseball.

					DOOLITTLE
			I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But
			I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The
			idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge.
			We're here to prove to them that they're
			neither invincible nor superior.  So
			let's try this again.  Military targets
			only.

					RED
			Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy.
			To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And
			to practice it, ya gotta play --

					DOOLITTLE
			No baseball diamonds, Red.

					RED
			Y-Yes Sir.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

	The storm is subsiding, but it's still raining.  From the
	bridge of the Hornet, they spot the ENTERPRISE.

					ADMIRAL
			The Enterprise will ride shotgun when we
			launch the bombers.  They wanted our
			carriers at Pearl, and now we've come to
			them.  If the Japanese get us, they'll be
			having dinner in San Francisco next
			month.

	EXT.  FLIGHT DECK - THE HORNET - DAY

	The preparations begin.  Deck crews move the B-25's to the
	rear of the flight deck.  Fueling teams top off the bomber's
	gas tanks.  Ordnance men hoist four bombs into each aircraft,
	and the army gunners load ammunition for the machine guns.
	Greening checks the planes' mechanical and hydraulic systems.

	And once again the pilots are out pacing the deck distance.
	It's turned into a game for them, walking off nerves.  As
	Rafe and Danny pass.

					RAFE
			It's not getting any longer.

					DANNY
			Longer?  It's getting shorter.

	INT.  HORNET - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	Doolittle is laying out the plan for all the pilots.

					DOOLITTLE
			We'll take off late this afternoon.  I'll
			hit Tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary
			bombs.  You'll come after me at night,
			guided by the fires.  Then it's on to
			China, where you'll arrive at dawn,
			guided to their airfields by the homing
			beacons the Chinese are going to switch
			on for us.  That's if everything is
			perfect -- like every other military
			mission I've ever been involved with.

	Doolittle looks around the room.  No one's smiling.

					DOOLITTLE
			Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane --
			then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you.
			I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't
			make it, you don't go.

					RAFE
			Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you
			make it or not.

					DOOLITTLE
			I know.

	EXT.  BRIDGE OF THE CRUISER NASHVILLE - DAY

	The cruiser Nashville is at the perimeter of the task force.
	It's lookouts spot Japanese patrol boats ahead.

	INT.  BRIDGE OF THE ENTERPRISE - DAY

	The message is handed to Admiral Halsey.

					OFFICER
			Sir, lookouts on the cruisers report
			patrol boats, ten miles away!

					HALSEY
			The Japs have set up a picket line!
			Order the cruisers to open fire!  We've
			got to sink them before they get a
			message away.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - DAY

	The cruiser NASHVILLE begins firing rounds at the Japanese
	patrol boat; round after round misses.

	INT.  HORNET'S RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The operators hear the excited voices of Japanese radio
	traffic.

					RADIO OPERATOR
			They've reported our position!  Tell the
			Admiral.

	EXT.  HORNET - DAY

	Doolittle hurries up to the command bridge, with the naval
	officers sent by the Admiral to fetch him.  Doolittle sees
	the cruisers next to the carrier firing its guns -- at
	Japanese boats in the distance.

	INT.  BRIDGE OF THE HORNET - DAY

	Doolittle finds the Admiral gathered with his staff, their
	mood is grim.

					DOOLITTLE
			How far are we from Tokyo?

					ADMIRAL
			Seven hundred miles.

	INT.  PILOT'S WARD ROOMS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES

	Rafe, Danny, and the other pilots are alone at their bunks,
	taking advantage of the lull before the mission.

	Rafe has paper and pen to write a letter, but he can't think
	of anything to write.

	Danny holds the "Picture of Paradise" that Sammy took, of
	Evelyn and the nurses in the sun.  He tucks it inside his
	shirt, when he hears --

					LOUDSPEAKER
			Army pilots, man your planes!

	EXT.  FLIGHT DECK - THE HORNET - DAY

	The pilots run onto deck.  The cruiser next to the Hornet is
	still firing away at the Japanese patrol boat.

	Doolittle runs onto deck, shouting orders.

					DOOLITTLE
			Load in every bit of extra gas you can
			carry!  And strip everything you don't
			need out of the planes.  I mean
			EVERYTHING!

	EXT.  HORNET - FLIGHT DECK - STRIPPING THE PLANES - DAY

	It's starting to rain but the guys don't notice at all.
	They're stripping seats out of the planes, tossing out their
	own gear.

	Greening pulls the machine guns out of the rear of the planes
	and puts in broomsticks painted black.

	Off in the distance the Japanese patrol boat takes a hit and
	explodes.  Rafe and Danny meet between their bombers.

					DANNY
			Broomsticks instead of tail guns.

					RAFE
			We'll get separated over the target, but
			you and I will rendezvous for the run to
			China.  I'm on your wing.

					DANNY
			And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.

					RAFE
			Home of the Brave.

	They climb into their bombers.

	EXT.  HORNET - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

	The engines are revving.  The tachs are showing redline.  The
	crews are in their planes.  Doolittle is first, just ahead of
	Rafe and Danny's B-25's.

	The battle pennants whip, the props blur, the wheels strain
	against the brakes; from the cockpits the flight deck looks
	impossibly short...and the American flag cracks in the wind.

	And now every pilot looks at Doolittle's plane...

	Doolittle starts the run down the flight deck...faster...the
	end looming.  He turns the plane almost vertical, standing it
	on its props...and lifts away smoothly.

	The sailors on deck cheer, like the Japanese did before Pearl
	Harbor.

	Rafe, Danny, and the others take off too.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	The B-25's head toward Japan.

	EXT.  PACIFIC - THE AMERICAN TASK FORCE - DAY

	Admiral Halsey, on the deck of the ENTERPRISE, watches as the
	last plane takes off.  The planes recede in the distance,
	racing just a few feet over the water, toward Japan.

					HALSEY
			Of all the other things this mission is
			doing that have never been done before...
			I've never sent out planes that I wasn't
			going to see safely home.  Let's get out
			of here.

	The task force runs for home.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	At first the planes are together; Rafe and Danny can see each
	other off each other's wing, and Doolittle's plane is ahead.
	The others are grouped after them.  They maintain strict
	radio silence, and can communicate only with gestures, hand
	signals, or a flasher for Morse code.  When Rafe speaks to
	the crew of his own plane, it's by pressing an intercom
	sender to his throat.

					RAFE
			What's our ETA for Tokyo?

	The bombardier/navigator is already working out the numbers
	at his plotting table in the center of the plane.

					NAVIGATOR
			Almost exactly at 12 noon.

					RED
			High n-noon.  I k-kinda like that.

	Rafe looks over to Danny and gives him a thumbs up.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

	Danny calls back to his GUNNER, who is watching the fuel
	supply.

					DANNY
			We got a 25-mile-an-hour head wind.  How
			we doing with fuel?

					GUNNER
			How do you think?

	The gunner is already pouring gas into the tanks from the
	extra cans.

	Anthony stands and moves back to the rear of the plane, pulls
	a piece of chalk from his pocket and writes on the nose of
	the bombs -- "For America,"  "For Pearl Harbor,"  "For the
	Arizona,"  "For Billy."

	-- Rafe flies, lost in thought...

	-- Evelyn is back at Pearl, struggling to keep her mind on
	   her work.

	-- Danny is looking at his gauges, then at the picture in
	   his shirt.

	EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	It's a pleasant day, and the people of Tokyo are in a
	confident, happy mood.  They're shopping, smiling, enjoying
	beautiful spring weather.  The Emperor is on the garden of
	his palace having lunch.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	The American planes are coming.

	INT.  DOOLITTLE'S PLANE - DAY

	He and his navigator confer.

					DOOLITTLE'S NAVIGATOR
			Time for the others to break off.

	His copilot uses the flashes to signal the other planes.
	They break off for their individual targets, every plane now
	on it's own.

	INT.  JAPANESE AIR DEFENSE STATION - DAY

	This is the nerve center of Tokyo's defense.  An OFFICER
	receives a message and reports to his supervisor.

					JAPANESE DEFENSE OFFICER
			Coastal stations report a low flying
			plane coming in off the sea.

					SUPERVISOR
			From the sea?... That couldn't be right,
			it must be part of the air raid practice
			this morning.

	EXT.  SKIMMING OVER THE WAVES - DAY

	The planes reach the Japanese coastline, and start skimming
	over treetop level.

	EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

	The office of an anti-aircraft battery blows its whistle; his
	crew mount their guns and swerves them around.  The officer
	whistle's again and checks his watch.

					ANTI-AIRCRAFT OFFICER
			Not bad.

	The crew dismount their guns; just a drill.

	EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	The Japanese people are unaware of the drill.  People are
	browsing through open-air shops, where new radios are turned
	on, playing music.  And Tokyo Rose is talking -- in English
	and Japanese.

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			It is another beautiful day in Tokyo, as
			all of Japan basks in a new day of
			victory.

	INT.  THE PLANES - DAY

	Coma, Danny's navigator, picks this up.

					COMA
			Listen to this -- it's Tokyo Rose.

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			Our brave sailors and soldiers, inspired
			by our divine Emperor, have pushed the
			Americans from the Pacific.

	These words go through the plane; and in the other planes
	they hear it too.

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			But hiding at home will not save them.
			Each time the Americans have tasted the
			samurai spirit, they have learned the
			bitter taste of defeat, while Japan is
			embraced by the divine wind that has
			protected our island for seven centuries.

	EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

	The planes reach Tokyo, and flash across the rooftops.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

					ANTHONY
			We'll give that bitch something to
			announce.

	Danny and Rafe give each other a wave, and divert toward
	their separate targets.  Each plane is on its own now.

	EXT.  TOKYO - DAY

	Doolittle's plane flashes right over the Emperor's palace.
	The Emperor sits in the garden, meditating.

	EXT.  TOKYO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	Mothers walking their children see the planes flash by
	overhead, and like the people at Pearl, they think they are
	friendlies.  A toddler points up and smiles.  His mother
	picks him up and hugs him happily.

					JAPANESE MOTHER
			Yes!  So beautiful!

	INT.  THE PLANES - DAY

	Rafe's bombardier works his 20-cent bombsight, as Rafe holds
	the plane steady, bringing it up to 200 feet.

	They scan for fighter or anti-aircraft fire.  There isn't
	any.

					RAFE
			Open bomb bay doors.

	DANNY'S PLANE runs toward its target...

	DOOLITTLE'S PLANE races over Tokyo...

					GUNNER
			Bomb bay doors open, sir.

					RAFE
			It's all yours.

	The bombardier hits the first switch.  The bomb falls toward
	a factory.

	It strikes home, right on target.  The blast is shocking --
	it blows debris higher than the plane.

	EXT.  TOKYO - THE BOMBING - VARIOUS SHOTS

	The individual planes drop their bombs, four per plane, on
	shipyards, factories, oil supplies, weapons facilities.
	Their bombing is highly accurate.

	On the ground, at the open-air market, for a brief moment
	Radio Tokyo goes silent; then --

					TOKYO ROSE (ON THE RADIO)
			We interrupt this broadcast... Tokyo is
			being bombed!

	EXT.  THE EMPEROR'S PALACE - DAY

	The Emperor looks up at the sound of air raid sirens and
	distant explosions.

					EMPEROR'S ATTENDANT
			Surely just a drill, Divine One.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - DAY

					NAVIGATOR
			Last bomb away.

	It slams into a factory, blowing debris everywhere and
	turning the factory into an inferno.

	Rafe's tail gunner sees Zeros swarming in with vengeance.

					GUNNER
			We got Zeros!  And they're pissed off!

	Rafe changes course quickly.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

	Anti-aircraft FLAK bursts in the sky in front of them; Danny
	takes evasive action.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - ABOVE TOKYO - DAY

	Rafe pushes the engines to top speed and changes course
	again; but the B-25's can't outrun the Zeros.  Their fire
	chews into the bomber's tail, hitting the gunner.  Red
	scrambles back to find the gunner dead.

					RAFE
			Can you get 'em off us?

	Red reacting to bullets coming through the rear of the
	fuselage, looks at the brooms protruding from the rear of the
	plane.

					RED
			Whatta ya want me to do, sweep 'em!

	As the bombardier, navigator, and Red jump onto the other
	machine guns, Rafe looks for a way out.  He dives down toward
	the city.  The Zeros follow.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER TOKYO - DAY

	Rafe takes the B-25 right down among the buildings, sometimes
	even having to spin the wings to get through.  The Zeros
	can't keep up with this...

	But Rafe can't keep it up long, either; they break out into
	open ground rail yards, where there's no place for him to
	hide...

	The Zeros come in to chew him up...

	But they take fire from another B-25 -- Danny's -- coming in
	to save Rafe's plane.  Rafe now uses the radio.

					RAFE
			Danny, get the hell out of here!

	But Danny stays, mixing it up with the Zeros; with both
	B-25's together, their machine guns down one Zero and damage
	another.  But there are too many.

	Rafe sees clouds coming in, and fog.

					RAFE
			Danny, run for the clouds!

	The bombers race toward the clouds, and make it; the Zeros
	lose them.

	EXT.  SKIES - BROKEN CLOUDS - DAY

	Rafe and Danny keep broken contact through the clouds, and
	settle in for the long run to China.

	INT.  RAFE'S COCKPIT - DAY

					RAFE
			We burned a lot of fuel back there.
			Flash them and ask about their supply.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - DAY

	Anthony reads the Morse code.

					ANTHONY
			"How's your fuel?"

	Danny looks across to Rafe and shakes his head.

	INT.  ROOSEVELT'S RESIDENCE - HYDE PARK, NY - DAY

	Roosevelt is at his desk when General Marshall enters.

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President.
			Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own
			broadcast to make the announcement.

					ROOSEVELT
			Have the planes made it to China?

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			There've been some complications, Sir.
			The Chinese didn't receive our request
			for homing beacons until is was too late
			to get them set.  And the planes had to
			take off so early they may lack fuel to
			make the mainland anyway.

					ROOSEVELT
			So those brave men are flying blind and
			running out of fuel.

					GENERAL MARSHALL
			The Chinese are sending out search
			parties to try to find the crews before
			the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes
			make it.

					ROOSEVELT
			God help them.

	EXT.  SEA OF JAPAN - DUSK

	They've climbed above the clouds; the fliers are exhausted.

	The sun is beginning to set.  Rafe stares at it...

	INT.  HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DUSK

	The place is white again -- the white of bandages and casts.
	Everyone is busy, and even the wounded are looking out for
	each other; a man with his arms in an airplane splint holds a
	spoon and feeds a badly burned buddy.  Evelyn and her
	overworked nurses are looking after the critical cases.  But
	as she covers the windows with blackout curtains, she stops
	for just a moment to stare at the sun's last rays.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - NIGHT

	Colonel Doolittle can make out mountains below them.

					DOOLITTLE
			We'll fly till we run out of fuel, then
			bail out.

	Just then his engines start to sputter.

					DOOLITTLE
			Chute!

	He puts the plane on auto-pilot and the men move to the
	hatches.  Three guys go out; it's just Doolittle and his
	copilot left.

					DOOLITTLE
			Nobody else is gonna make it either.  If
			I live through this, they're gonna put me
			in Leavenworth Prison.

	They jump.

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

	Coma moves up to Danny.

					COMA
			We're running out of fuel.  And I can't
			find the beacon.

	Danny gestures across to Rafe that he hears nothing in his
	radio phones.  Rafe gestures the same thing back.

	They look down and the entire ground is covered with clouds.

					RAFE
			I don't know if we're over sea or land.
			Drop flares and try to spot something.

	EXT.  SKIES OVER PACIFIC - NIGHT

	They drop flares; they disappear into the cloud cover and
	tell them nothing.

	EXT.  SKIES - RAFE AND DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

	Danny's engines are sputtering; his gunner pours the last
	drops of gas into the tanks.

					DANNY
			Flash Rafe.  We're gonna bail.

	Red sees Anthony signal.

					RED
			They've gotta jump.

					RAFE
			Not unless we know he's over land!

	Rafe yells at Danny, as if he could hear --

					RAFE
			You are not bailing out into water!

					RAFE'S NAVIGATOR
			Coastline below!

	Through a break in the clouds they spot a rocky shoreline.

					RAFE
			We've got coast!  Signal him to climb and
			jump.

	Red signals; Danny's plane signals back.

					RED
			They don't have fuel to make altitude.
			He's gonna set it down in the water.

	Rafe looks over at Danny, who is gesturing; he gives up on
	the hand signals and grabs the flasher; Red reads the Morse
	code...

					RED
			Y-O-U... G-O.  You go on.

	Rafe grabs the flasher and angrily flashes back two letters.

					RAFE
			N-O!  We stay together!  I'll go in
			first.

	Rafe turns his bomber and Danny follows, their planes arcing
	down toward the rocky coast; it's hairy, the clouds masking
	their view, as the altimeter winds down... At the last moment
	they see rocks looming out of the surf.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT

	He's shouting to his crew --

					RAFE
			Hang on tight!  I'll put her in the
			smooth water and we'll swim in!

	INT.  DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT

	His engines are sputtering, catching, sputtering; he fights
	to stay in control.

	EXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT

	Rafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the
	engine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface;
	then the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a
	wall, flipping over it's nose.

	DANNY'S PLANE is struggling; when he tries to add throttle,
	the engines sputter out.  The plane drops, skips once on the
	surface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first.

	Danny and Anthony are ejected through the top of the
	fuselage; Coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose
	of the plane.

	INT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT

	Rafe and Red come to in the plane inverted and sinking.  They
	react, unbuckling, grabbing for their crewmates as the plane
	is quickly filling.  The navigator and gunner are
	unconscious; the bombardier is dead.  Red struggles with the
	hatch and can't make it budge.

					RAFE
			It won't open til the plane fills!

	They struggle to breath as the water envelops them.  But as
	the water reaches the top, Rafe takes a last breath and dives
	to the hatch; it comes open, and they swim up, dragging the
	rest of the crew.

	EXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT

	They break the surface, and struggle to shore with the
	unconscious navigator and gunner.

	Rafe's looking everywhere; he sees Danny's plane crashed
	against the rock.  He fights his way through the surf to
	Danny's plane, Red following.

	Rafe finds Danny face up in the water.

	Red finds Anthony on the rock.  He's face up, but as Red
	lifts him he finds the back of Anthony's head is gone.

	The rest of Danny's crew are floating in the surf, dead.
	Rafe and Red pull Danny to shore.

					RAFE
			Danny!  DANNY!

	Danny's eyes flutter open; he sees Rafe and mumbles --

					DANNY
			I've made better landings.

	Danny's hand gropes to his throat; Rafe finds a V shaped
	shard of the fuselage hooked into his neck.

	Rafe grabs it, trying to bend it open; the sharp metal cuts
	his hands, but he keeps straining.  It won't work, He pulls
	his .45 from his jacket and tries to pry the metal.  It works
	a bit; he tosses the pistol aside and grabs the shard again,
	and opens it.

					RAFE
			You hang on, Danny!  You hang on!  You're
			gonna make it!

	Rafe's head snaps forward, crunched with the butt of a rifle;
	a Japanese patrol, four men, have arrived.  They're angry,
	scared, hyped.  They knock Red down too, yelling and
	brandishing their rifles at the fliers on the beach, living
	and dead.

	The Japanese officer is barking orders.  They find the
	Captain's insignia on Danny's jacket, and begin binding him
	to a yoke, his wrists tied to the wood like a crucifixion, a
	wire around his neck.  They find the navigator unconscious,
	but alive.  The officer snaps a single word and a soldier
	shoots the navigator.

	The others wire Rafe's ankles together... Rafe is
	emotionless.

	RAFE'S CONSCIOUSNESS fades in and out.  He hears Danny
	choking, and his mind sees Danny as a boy those long years
	ago, being carried by the neck across the field by his
	father...

	Then Rafe sees THE PRESENT:  Danny being half-carried, half-
	dragged by the neck by two Japanese.  The officer is pulling
	Red along, hands bound behind him.  And Rafe starts moving,
	being dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky
	sand.

	His hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock.

	The whole world slows down.

	He clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny.  And as
	the man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the
	face.

	The officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling
	Red, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle
	too.  The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when
	Danny slams him down from behind.

	The fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim
	for Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from
	behind.

	The Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by
	scythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just
	arriving.

	Rafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside.  Danny
	lies on his back, clutching his wound as if to hold onto his
	life.

					RAFE
			Danny...

					DANNY
			I can't make it.

					RAFE
			Yes you can.

	But Danny is silent, his eyes drifting shut, and in that
	moment Rafe thinks he is gone already.  Then Danny's eyes
	drift open, finding him.

					DANNY
			Take care of Evelyn.

	The words almost kill Rafe, filling him with grief.  From
	somewhere he finds the strength to say --

					RAFE
			I will.  And your baby.
				(beat)
			You're gonna be a father.

	Did Danny hear?  His eyes are closed again.  But his head
	comes up; Rafe takes it, and Danny pulls him closer to
	whisper --

					DANNY
			No.  You are.

	Rafe cradles Danny in his arms.  Danny's eyes are open, but
	Rafe sees no light there.

					RAFE
			Danny... Land of the free... Land of the
			free...

	But Danny will never answer him again.  Rafe hugs Danny
	tight, and weeps.

	EXT.  VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

	The news of the raid hits Washington...and the rest of
	America.  If it isn't wild celebration; when people see the
	headline:  AIR RAID ON TOKYO, and DOOLITTLE DOES MUCH; their
	faces change, as if finally told what they already knew --
	that America would prevail.

					VOICE OVER
			The Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment
			of America's war with Japan.  Before it,
			America knew nothing but defeat; after
			it, nothing but victory.
				(beat)
			One crew of Doolittle's raiders made it to
			Vladivostok, Russia, where they were
			interred for much of the war.  Thirteen
			planes crash landed in China, where the
			Chinese people helped the Americans
			escape, and had their villages destroyed
			and citizens executed by the Japanese
			forces of occupation.  Two crews were
			captured by the Japanese and three fliers
			were executed without trial, called "war
			criminals" by the Japanese.  Jimmy
			Doolittle was promoted to General, and
			given the medal of honor.

	We see the ceremony at the White House, as Roosevelt presents
	Doolittle with the metal.

	EXT.  TENNESSEE - DAY

	Out by the crop dusting landing field is a memorial to Danny
	Walker, with an American flag flying high above it.  Standing
	at the memorial are Rafe and Evelyn.  Rafe holds a child in
	his arms, a boy, named Danny.

								FADE OUT.

1   EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                             1

    The titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old
    typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings,
    announcing the end of a line, and we see our title...

    THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER

    Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city.
    Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a
    child in the back of a station wagon.

    We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us
    wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then
    we enter...

    The Tunnel.

    We keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden,
    alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of
    the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway.

    We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a
    window, and into...

2   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  2

    It is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books.
    CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable
    to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing
    a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the
    radio on his cassette boom box.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               Dear Friend, I am writing to you because
               she said you listen and understand and
               didn't try to sleep with that person at
               that party even though you could have.
               Please don't try to figure out who she is
               because then you might figure out who I
               am, and I don't want you to do that. I
               just need to know that people like you
               exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't
               think I was the weird kid who spent time
               in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you
               nervous.

3   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                            3

    Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban
    split level house.
                                                                       2.


                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
              I hope it's okay for me to think that.
              You see, I haven't really talked to
              anyone outside of my family all summer.

    Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football
    game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine.
    Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits.

4   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      4

    Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
              But tomorrow is my first day of high
              school ever, and I really need to turn
              things around this year.
                  (hopeful)
              So, I have a plan.

5   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LAST DAY                      5

    We see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The
    kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in
    the air like a New York confetti parade.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
              As I enter the school for the first time,
              I will visualize what it will be like on
              the last day of my senior year.

    Charlie walks down the hall.   Triumphant.   Confident.   Happy.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

6   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FIRST DAY                     6

    Reality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from
    Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making
    dozens of freshmen hop down the hall.

                        SENIOR BULLY
              Hop, freshman toads. Hop!    Move it, boys!

    As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
              ... 1,385 days from now.

    VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets.
                                                                    3.


                        LINEBACKER
              Man, you got big.

                        NOSE TACKLE
              Worked out all summer.   Rock hard, dude.

    At the front of the pack is BRAD HAYS (17), the quarterback.
    He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly. The big man on
    campus. Nice guy, too.

                        BRAD HAYS
              Would you guys get a room?

    They laugh. Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them.
    Trying to make himself as small as possible.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
                  (trying to be optimistic)
              Just 1,385 days.

7   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                  7

    Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister. CANDACE
    KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
              In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister
              Candace and her boyfriend Derek would
              have let me eat lunch with their earth
              club.

                        CANDACE
              Seniors only.
                  (barks to Derek)
              What are you doing with a plastic spork?

    Candace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17. Derek is such a
    pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail.

                        DEREK
              I don't want to bring back silverware--

                        CANDACE
              Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.

    Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog. Charlie
    watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria.

8   INT. CAFETERIA - LATER                                           8

    Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a
    great time with their friends. He sees a pretty girl with
    blonde hair having the best first day. This is SUSAN, 14.
                                                                   4.


                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
              When my sister said no, I thought maybe
              my old friend Susan would want to have
              lunch with me.

    Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              In middle school, Susan was very fun to
              be around, but now she doesn't like to
              say hi to me anymore.

    Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              And then there's Brad Hays, who's the
              quarterback of our team. Before my
              brother went to play football for Penn
              State, he and Brad played together. So,
              I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But
              Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am
              I kidding?

    Brad catches Charlie staring at him.   Awkward.

9   INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY                                           9

    Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as
    a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.

                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
              On the bright side, one senior decided to
              make fun of the teacher instead of the
              freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
              legendary goatee with a grease pencil.

    Meet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over
    high school. He is the class clown, performing a perfect
    imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan.

                        PATRICK
              Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I
              learned that in 'Nam back in '68.
              "Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down
              that prick punch and go kill some gooks."

    The laughter suddenly dies as the real MR. CALLAHAN (57)
    walks up behind the oblivious Patrick.

                        PATRICK (CONT'D)
              But you know what happened? That prick
              punch killed my best friend in a Saigon
              whorehouse.
                                                                     5.


     Patrick suddenly feels Mr. Callahan behind him.   Oops.

                         MR. CALLAHAN
               I heard you were going to be in my class.
               Are you proud being a senior taking
               freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?

                         PATRICK
               My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick
               or you call me nothing.

                         MR. CALLAHAN
               Okay... Nothing.

     The class laughs. Except Charlie.   He watches Patrick take
     the long walk back to his seat.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't
               saying the impersonation to be mean or
               anything. He was just trying to make us
               freshmen feel better.

                         MR. CALLAHAN
               Everyone open your safety guides.
               Nothing... why don't you read first?

     Patrick opens the book.

                         PATRICK
               Chapter 1. Surviving your fascist shop
               teacher, who needs to put kids down to
               feel big.
                   (to the class)
               Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should
               read on.

     Charlie smiles.   He loves him already.

10   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING                                    10

     The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird.
     Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the
     plastic pouch, and writes... "ENGLISH CLASS... DAY ONE."

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               My last class of the day is advanced
               English, and I'm excited to finally start
               learning with the smartest kids in the
               school...

     A SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him.
                                                               6.


                    SMART ASS FRESHMAN
              (whispers)
          Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

The kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the
blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But
you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist.

                    BILL
          Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to
          Teach for America, I'm going to be your
          teacher for freshman English. This
          semester, we're going to be learning
          Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
          Genius book. Now, who wants to get out
          of the first pop quiz?

All hands go up.   Except Charlie's.   Bill paces the rows.

                    BILL (CONT'D)
          I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the
          quiz if you tell me which author invented
          the paperback book. Anyone?

As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.

                    BILL (CONT'D)
          He's British. He also invented the
          serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3
          of his first novel, he had a man hanging
          off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence,
          the term cliffhanger. Anybody?

                    FRESHMAN GIRL
          Shakespeare.

                    BILL
          That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare
          didn't write novels. Anybody else?
              (off their silence)
          The author was...

Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has
already written... Charles Dickens.

                    BILL (CONT'D)
          ... Charles Dickens. However, if you and
          I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's
          time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can
          you imagine that? We would have put
          those pennies in a metal box, which the
          ushers would lock in the office. And
          that's where we get the term... anyone?
                                                                     7.


                         KIDS (O.S.)
               "Office Depot!" "Office Supplies!"

     Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that
     Bill is staring at him. Waiting for him to raise his hand.

                         BILL
               I'll give you a free "A" on anything but
               the final term paper if you get it right.

     Charlie looks down.   He's not going to answer.

                         BILL (CONT'D)
               Box office.

     The kids groan. They should have known.     Charlie smiles to
     himself. He's going to like this class.

11   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - LATER                                      11

     The bell rings. The students chatter their way out of class.
     The last to leave is Charlie.

                         BILL
               You should learn to participate.

     Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board.

                         BILL (CONT'D)
               Why didn't you raise your hand?
                   (off Charlie's shrug)
               They call you teacher's pet? Freak?
                   (off Charlie's nod)
               I used to get spaz. I mean, come on,
               spaz?

     Charlie smiles.   Bill takes a moment.   Then...

                         BILL (CONT'D)
               So, I heard you had a tough time last
               year. But they say if you make one friend
               on your first day, you're doing okay.

                         CHARLIE
               Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher
               is the only friend I make today, that
               would be sort of depressing.

                          BILL
               Yeah.   I could see that.

                         CHARLIE
               Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay.
                                                                     8.


     Bill nods and watches Charlie exit.   He gets swallowed up by
     the hallway as the bell rings.

12   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     12

     Charlie looks through the thick office glass. He sees
     Patrick use his charms on MRS. SMALL, (58) the Principal.

                         PATRICK
                   (to Mrs. Small)
               I would happily not take shop...

     Out of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book.

                         SENIOR BULLY
               Hey, Freshman Toad.

     The bully rips the cover. He throws it on the ground as his
     friends laugh and disappear down the hall. Charlie walks up
     and picks up his book.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               Well, I have 1,384 days to go. And just
               so I say it to someone, high school is
               even worse than middle school.

13   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                      13

     Charlie walks up the path to his house.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               If my parents ask me about it, I probably
               won't tell them the truth because I don't
               want them to worry that I might get bad
               again.

14   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON                                14

     Charlie tapes his book cover back together. He looks up as
     his dad comes home from a long day. Charlie's mom hugs him.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could
               talk to her. And I know she would
               understand how I am both happy and sad,
               and I'm still trying to figure out how
               that could be. I just hope I make a
               friend soon. Love always, Charlie.

15   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING                      15

     Charlie stands in the kitchen, pouring his milk.
                                                                      9.


                         MOTHER (O.S.)
               Charlie, come on.

     His family is seated around the table.    Candace's boyfriend,
     Derek, is their special guest.

                         DEREK
               Mmmm. This chicken paprikash is
               delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

     Charlie's father rolls his eyes, then reads his sports page.

                         MOTHER
               Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's
               favorite. He was a little nervous about
               starting high school, so I made it.

                         FATHER
               You feel a little silly being nervous
               now, huh, champ?

                           CHARLIE
               Yes, sir.    I sure do.

     Charlie carries his milk back to the table.   He quickly sits,
     hoping someone will change the subject.

                         FATHER
               I told you. Just give 'em a smile and be
               yourself. That's how you--

                         CANDACE
               "--make friends in the real world."

                         FATHER
               You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

                         DEREK
               Freshman year is tough, but you really
               find yourself.

                         FATHER
                   (deep eye roll)
               Thanks, Derek.

16   INT. LIVING ROOM / ENTRY HALL - EVENING                          16

     Charlie's father and mother watch a local sports show.
     Charlie passes by them with ice cream on his way downstairs.

                         MOTHER
               I think you could be a little nicer to
               Derek.
                                                                        10.


                            FATHER
               I'm sorry.     The kid's a pussy.   I can't
               stand him.

     Charlie moves to the entry hall. He looks through the screen
     door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye.
     As Derek walks to his mom's Mercedes, Candace joins Charlie.

                         DEREK
                   (waving from car)
               I hope you love the mix I made.     The
               cover is hand-painted.

     When he gets into his car, she hands Charlie the mix tape.

                         CANDACE
               Charlie, do you want this?

                         CHARLIE
               Are you sure?

                         CANDACE
               He gives me one every week.

17   INT. CHARLIE'S BED ROOM - DUSK                                      17

     Charlie sits on his bed, reading To Kill a Mockingbird, the
     cover taped back together. We see Derek's mix... Autumn
     Leaves... rotate in his old tape recorder.

                         DEREK (V.O.)
               Hey, Babe. This next one might be a
               little sad, but it reminded me of your
               eyes.

     The first notes of The Smiths' "Asleep" begins.     As Morrissey
     sings, Charlie keeps reading. And reading.

                                                              CUT TO:

18   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        18

     The reading is done. Charlie proudly puts To Kill a
     Mockingbird on his newly dubbed "Shelf of Fame."

19   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                   19

     The songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to
     day life over the next few weeks. Charlie exits his English
     class. FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by...

                         SMART ASS FRESHMAN
               Did you already do the term paper on To
                                                                        11.


     Silence. They grab and drag him into the boy's room.     We
     hear the toilet flush for the swirly.

20   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                       20

     Charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin.
     He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with RC cola.

21   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                              21

     Charlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions
     on TV. He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy
     building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him.

22   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     22

     Charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria.
     Not giving up. Looking for somewhere to sit.

                                                              CUT TO:

23   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     23

     Charlie sits by himself in the corner. He looks around the
     cafeteria, wanting to break in. Not knowing how. After a
     moment, he returns to his book. The song ends.

24   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT              24

     Friday Night Football in Western, PA. Charlie buys his Coke
     and nachos and wanders to the bleachers. He sits alone,
     trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students.
     When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears...

                         PATRICK
               Come on Devils! Woooooo!

     Charlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off.    TWIN
     SENIOR GIRLS pass him, taunting.

                         TWIN SENIOR GIRLS
               Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.

                         PATRICK
               Suck it, virginity pledges!

     Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly. After driving
     himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches.

                         CHARLIE
               Hey... Patrick.
                                                                12.


                    PATRICK
          Hey! You're in my shop class, right?
          How's your clock coming?

                    CHARLIE
          My dad's building it.

                    PATRICK
          Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.
              (off Charlie's awkward silence)
          You want to sit over here, or are you
          waiting for your friends?

                     CHARLIE
          No.   I'll sit if that's okay.

Patrick motions for Charlie to sit.   Charlie sits.   Elated.

                    PATRICK
          Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by
          the way. It's an endless nightmare. And
          these assholes actually think they're
          being original.

Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field.
Charlie dries his hands on his pants. So nervous. A 5
second silence that feels like a year. Think of something to
say. Anything.

                    CHARLIE
          So, uh... you like football?

                      PATRICK
          Love it.

                    CHARLIE
          Then, maybe you know my broth--

                      PATRICK
          Hey, Sam.

Charlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's
ever seen. SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every
father nervous. She is alive, adventurous, and a world class
flirt. Great attitude. Great taste. Great banter.

                    SAM
          Question. Could the bathrooms here be
          more disgusting?

                    PATRICK
          Yes, they call it the men's room.
                                                               13.


Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick.
Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy.

                    SAM
          Well, I finally got hold of Bob.

                    PATRICK
          Party tonight?

                    SAM
          No. He's still trying to shag that
          waitress from the Olive Garden.

                    PATRICK
          He's never tossing that salad.

Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field. The
kids clap. Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick.

                    SAM
              (about Charlie)
          Patrick... who's this?

                       PATRICK
          This is...

                    CHARLIE
          Uh... Charlie... Kelmeckis.

                    PATRICK
          Kelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates
          Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?

                    CHARLIE
          Is that what they call him?

                    SAM
          Awww. Leave Pony Tail Derek alone.    You
          put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.

                    PATRICK
          I try, Sam. I try.

                    SAM
          It's nice to meet you, Charlie.    I'm Sam.

Sam extends her hand to Charlie. Every nail a different
color. They shake. Then, Sam grabs a nacho. Zoinks!

                    PATRICK
          So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go
          to Mary Elizabeth's house?
                                                                     14.


                         SAM
               Can't. She got caught watering down her
               parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's
               just go to Kings.

                         PATRICK
                   (turns to Charlie)
               Hey... we're going to Kings after the
               game if you want to come.

     Charlie nods just as Brad Hays tosses a touchdown pass.   The
     fans go crazy. Especially Patrick. Charlie smiles.

25   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             25

     The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter!
     The place is packed. Patrick and Sam drink coffee while
     Charlie eats his brownie. They're all excited.

                         SAM
               Do you have a favorite band?

                         CHARLIE
               I think The Smiths are my favorite.

                         SAM
               Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths!
               The best breakup band ever. What's your
               favorite song?

                         CHARLIE
               Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I
               heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.

                         PATRICK
               That works on so many levels.

                         CHARLIE
               I could make a copy for you.

                         SAM
               Thanks. What about Eide's?     You love
               Eide's, right?

                         CHARLIE
                   (never heard of it)
               Yeah. They're great.

                         PATRICK
               Not a band, Charlie.

                         SAM
               It's an old record store downtown.
                                                                     15.


                    PATRICK
          I used to be popular before Sam got me
          some good music. So, watch out, Charlie.
          She'll ruin your life forever.

                    CHARLIE
          That's okay.

Brad Hays, the quarterback, passes with his posse.       Taunting.

                    NOSE TACKLE & LINEBACKER
          Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.

                       PATRICK
          Let it go!     Jesus!   It's an old joke!
          It's over!

Sam laughs.   She loves watching Patrick get riled up.

                    SAM
          So, Charlie... what are you going to do
          when you get out of here?

                    CHARLIE
          My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer,
          but I don't know what I'd write about.

                    SAM
          You could write about us.

                    PATRICK
          Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.      Make
          us solve crimes.

Sam laughs.   Charlie smiles.

                    CHARLIE
          You guys look happy together. How long
          have you been boyfriend and girlfriend?
              (off their laughs)
          What?

                    SAM
          He's my step-brother. My mom finally
          left my worthless dad and married his
          nice dad 3 years ago.

                    PATRICK
          But Sam's not bitter.     Make no mistake.

                     SAM
          Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic.      I'm a
          bulim-ist.
                                                                      16.


     They laugh at their inside joke.    Charlie has no idea what's
     so funny.

                            CHARLIE
               I'm sorry.     I don't know what that means.

                         PATRICK
               She just really believes in bulimia.

                         SAM
                   (cracking up)
               I love bulimia.

26   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      26

     Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck.    The music blares.

                         PATRICK
               Thanks for paying, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
                   (so eager)
               No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey...
               maybe I'll see you around in school?

                         SAM
                   (distracted - to Patrick)
               God, would you turn that down? You're
               going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie.

                         PATRICK
               Bye, Charlie.

                          CHARLIE
               Okay.   Bye.

     Charlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face.
     The happiness from one night of company.

27   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      27

     Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news.
     He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He
     hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement.

28   INT. DOORWAY TO BASEMENT - NIGHT                                  28

     As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting.

                         DEREK (O.S.)
               I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it.
               Please talk to me.
                                                                   17.


                         CANDACE (O.S.)
               Maybe your mom and I should have a "drive
               us to our hair appointment" contest.
               Then, I could spend a Saturday with you.

     Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find...

                         DEREK
               There's nothing I can do--

                         CANDACE
               Do you always want to be a mama's boy?

                         DEREK
               I am not a mama's boy--

                        CANDACE
               Yes! You are! Every time I go to your
               house--

                          DEREK
               Shhh.   Shut u--

                         CANDACE
               -- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia
               with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy
               needs you to stay at home because she
               can't drive herself." She's only 51.

                         DEREK
               SHUT UP, CANDACE!

29   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS                   29

     Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is
     red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging.

                          CANDACE
               And you just stand there like a little
               bitch dog.

     SNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's
     not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after
     it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her
     up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him.

                         CANDACE (CONT'D)
               Charlie, just go. I can handle it.   Just
               don't wake up mom and dad.

     She pushes him out of the room and closes the door.
                                                                         18.


30   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                       30

     Charlie sits at his desk. So disturbed. He hears a car
     start outside. He moves to his window and looks down at
     Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is
     crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss.

     Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.

                         MOTHER (V.O.)
               Hey, look who's here...


                                                         FLASHBACK TO:

31   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                                  31

     The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN
     entering the house. Aunt Helen carries a suitcase. The
     children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad.
     They just know they love her. Little Charlie stands at the
     top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday
     clothes. There are balloons. And streamers.

                         LITTLE CANDACE
               Welcome home, Aunt Helen!

                          AUNT HELEN
               Oh.   Look at you all, dressed so nice.

     Aunt Helen smiles at Little Charlie on top of the stairs.

                                                         MATCH CUT TO:

32   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (PRESENT)                                    32

     Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the
     house. She is startled when she sees Charlie. They whisper.

                         CHARLIE
               What are you doing?

                         CANDACE
               Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's
               never hit me before. I promise he'll
               never hit me again.

     She's about to go back downstairs when...

                         CHARLIE
               Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?

     A silence passes between them.   Then...
                                                                    19.


                         CANDACE
               Charlie... this is Pony Tail Derek.   I
               can handle him. Will you trust me?
               Please, don't tell mom and dad.

     With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs.
     Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled.

33   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                          33

     The Homecoming Dance is in full swing. God bless everyone.
     Especially Charlie. He's alone at the wall, dressed in his
     Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell.

     Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As
     happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the
     right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause.

     After a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam
     and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of
     "Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.

                         SAM
               Oh, my God. They're playing good music.

                         PATRICK
               Holy shit. They are!   They're playing
               good music!

                         SAM
                   (total mischief)
               Living room routine?

                         PATRICK
               Living room routine!

     Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the
     floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. It starts
     slow. "So over it" hand moves. A little shoulder. And
     then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius.

     Charlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to
     look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them.
     He bobs his head like a dork. And once he gets close,
     Patrick and Sam turn and find him.

                         SAM & PATRICK
               Hey!

     Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a
     circle. Their own island. After a moment, Sam moves around
     Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.
                                                                     20.


34   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         34

     The party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town.
     Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing.

                         SAM
               God, it's freezing.

                         PATRICK
               But you wore that toasty costume. It's
               not like you're trying too hard to be
               original.

                         SAM
               Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.

                         CHARLIE
               Are you sure it's okay that I come?

                         SAM
               Of course. Just remember, Charlie...
               Bob's not paranoid.

                         PATRICK
               "He's sensitive."

     Sam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the
     cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so
     often that people can't tell the difference anymore.

                         BOB
               Sam... that waitress from the Olive
               Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?

                         SAM
               Only if I have Patrick's blessing.

                          BOB
               Patrick?

                         PATRICK
               You're a hopeless stoner who attends the
               culinary institute. So, I'm going to
               have to say "no" on that one, but nice
               try. Charlie?

     Patrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam.

                          BOB
               Touché.

35   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                              35
                                                               21.


                    PATRICK
          Charlie... this is a party.

The music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they
walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and
cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed
                                                                 *
with kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a
watermelon.

                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
          This is what fun looks like.

Patrick smiles when he spots two friends.

                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
          You ready to meet some desperate women?

MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together.
Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely
bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in
college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary
Elizabeth's "beta female."

                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
          Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet
          Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies.

They shake hands and say their hellos.

                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
          This is Charlie's first party ever. So,
          I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow
          jobs from both of you.

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          Patrick, you're such a dick.

                    PATRICK
          Where the hell did you go?

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          The dance was a little boring, don't you
          think?

                    PATRICK
          You're so selfish. We looked everywhere
          for you. You could have told someone.

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          Cry me a river.

                    PATRICK
          How is it that you got meaner since
                                                                       22.


                         MARY ELIZABETH
               Just lucky I guess.

                         PATRICK
               I think you're doing something wrong.

                         MARY ELIZABETH
               Or something very right.

     Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam
     calls out from the other side of the room.

                           SAM (O.S.)
               Hey!    Look who's here!

     The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback,
     enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie
     sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked.

                         CHARLIE
               Is that Brad Hays?

                           ALICE
               Yeah.    He comes here sometimes.

                         CHARLIE
               But he's a popular kid.

                         MARY ELIZABETH
                   (offended)
               Then, what are we?

     Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't.    The girls
     turn, ignoring him. Bob approaches with a tray.

                         BOB
               Charlie, you look like you could use a
               brownie.

                         CHARLIE
               Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance.
               I was going to go to King's, but I didn't
               really have any time. Thanks.

     Bob smiles. Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance.
     Charlie bites into the brownie. The icing gushing between
     his teeth. The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale
     as he chews and chews and chews.

36   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - LATER                                        36

     After a beat, the music changes, and the image exhales back
     down to Charlie, who is now... baked out of his mind. The
                                                             23.

whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with
laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks.

                    CHARLIE
          Have you guys felt this carpet?     This
          carpet feels so darn good.

                    MARY ELIZABETH
              (laughing)
          Charlie, what do you think about high
          school?

                    CHARLIE
          High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is
          called the Nutrition Center. And people
          wear their letter jackets even when it's
          98 degrees out. And why do they give out
          letters for marching band? That's not a
          sport, and we all know it.

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          This kid is crazy.

Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut.

                    CHARLIE
          And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
          going to regret that haircut when you
          look back at old photographs.
              (off their laughter)
          I'm really sorry. That sounded like a
          compliment in my head.

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          Oh, my God!

                    ALICE
          Well, it's kind of true.

                       MARY ELIZABETH
          Shut up!

Sam enters the room.    Takes quick stock.   Then...

                    SAM
          Bob, did you get him stoned?

                    BOB
          Come on, Sam. He likes it.     Just look at
          him.

                    SAM
          How do you feel, Charlie?
                                                                     24.


                         CHARLIE
               I just really want a milkshake.

     The entire room explodes with laughter.    Charlie loves that
     people find him so funny.

37   INT. BOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       37

     Sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender.
     Charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake.

                         CHARLIE
               Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the
               kind of pretty that deserves to make a
               big deal about itself. You know what I
               mean?

                         SAM
               Okay, Charlie.     Let me make the milkshake.

                         CHARLIE
               What a great word. Milkshake. It's like
               when you say your name over and over
               again in the mirror, and after awhile, it
               sounds crazy.

                         SAM
               I'm guessing you've never been high
               before?

                         CHARLIE
               Me? No. My best friend Michael. His
               dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all
               that stuff. Parties, too.

                         SAM
               Well, where is Michael tonight?

                         CHARLIE
               Oh, he shot himself last May.

     Sam looks up.   Shocked silent.   Charlie is just stoned.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I kind of wish he'd left a note.    You
               know what I mean?
                   (off her sad nod)
               Where's the bathroom?

                         SAM
               It's up the stairs.

                          CHARLIE
                                                                     25.


     Charlie wanders off.    Sam watches him go.

38   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                             38

     Charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in
     a large ornate mirror in the hallway.

                            CHARLIE
               Charlie.     Charlie.   Weird.

     Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost. He finds
     the door to the master bedroom and opens it. He sees Patrick
     and Brad Hays... kissing.

                            CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Woah.

                            PATRICK
               Charlie?

                         BRAD HAYS
                   (nervous)
               Who is that kid?

                          PATRICK
               Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine.
               Stay here.

     Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
               I didn't see anything.

                         PATRICK
               I know you saw something, but it's okay.

     Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching.

                         PATRICK (CONT'D)
               Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to
               know... wait, are you baked?

                         CHARLIE
               "Like a cake." That's what Bob said.
               And how you can't have 3 on a match
               because they would find us. And everyone
               laughed, but I don't know what's funny.

                         PATRICK
               Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to
               promise that you're not going to say
               anything to anyone about me and Brad.
               This has to be our little secret.
                                                                        26.


                         CHARLIE
               Our little secret.     Agreed.

                            PATRICK
               Thank you.     We'll talk later.

                         CHARLIE
               I look forward to that big talk.

     Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door.

39   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - NIGHT                                         39

     The party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his
     milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth.

                         CHARLIE
               Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice?
               It's even better than the first one.

     Patrick walks downstairs.    Sam motions him over.

                         SAM
                   (barely audible whisper)
               I need to talk to you. Charlie just told
               me that his best friend shot himself. I
               don't think he has any friends.

     Patrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the
     kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd.

                            PATRICK
               Everyone.     Raise your glasses to Charlie.

     Charlie looks up.   A little paranoid.     Everyone is staring.

                         CHARLIE
               What did I do?

                         PATRICK
               You didn't do anything. We just want to
               toast our new friend.
                   (off his look)
               You see things. And you understand.
               You're a wallflower.

     Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants.     He looks around
     the room at the nods and friendly faces.

                         PATRICK (CONT'D)
               What is it? What's wrong?

                            CHARLIE
                                                                         27.


                         PATRICK
               Well, we didn't think there were any cool
               people left to meet. So, everyone...

                         SAM & EVERYONE
               To Charlie.

     They all drink.    Sam approaches him.    A knowing smile.

                         SAM
               Welcome to the island of misfit toys.

     Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud.

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

40   EXT./INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        40

     The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
     Patrick drives. Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel
     Song." The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our
     prototype for tone.

                           SAM
               My God.    What is this song!?

                           PATRICK
               Right?    I have no idea.

                         SAM
                   (to Charlie)
               Have you heard it before?

                            CHARLIE
               Never.

                         SAM
                   (light bulb)
               Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!

                         PATRICK
               Sam, it's freezing.

                         SAM
               Patrick, it's the perfect song!

                            PATRICK
               No.     Mama Patrick says no.

                         SAM
               Patrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to
               you, I'm begging you to drive me--
                                                                      28.


                            PATRICK
                      (laughing)
                  Alright! I concede!

     Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed.   She grips the
     flood lights to steady herself as she stands.

                            CHARLIE
                  What is she doing?

                            PATRICK
                  Don't worry. She does it all the time.

                            SAM
                  Turn it up!

                            PATRICK
                  You got it, your highness.

     Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel,
     just as the truck flies into...

     THE TUNNEL

     We go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the
     air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from
     Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her
     right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the
     camera. Right at us. For we are now...

     Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit.
     So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets
     this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.

                            PATRICK (CONT'D)
                  What?

                            CHARLIE
                  I feel infinite.

     The truck flies out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel onto the bridge.
     Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms. Free and
     young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life.

                                                            CUT TO:

41   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                                41

     We see Charlie proudly put a Smiths poster on his wall next
     to photos of his new friends. He dances to his desk,
     listening to Air Supply's "All Out of Love" on his Walkman.
                                                                     29.


                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written
               for awhile, but I've been trying hard not
               to be a loser.

     As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs...

                         AIR SUPPLY
               I'm lying alone with my head on the
               phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.

     Charlie sits at his desk, writing and lip-synching.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               For example, I am trying to participate
               by listening to Sam's collection of big
               rock ballads and thinking about love.
               Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant.
               I completely agree.

42   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                                  42

     As the students file out, Charlie hands his paper to Bill in
     exchange for a beat up copy of The Great Gatsby.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               I am also studying extra books outside of
               class. As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is
               a writer. He even had a play put up in
               New York once, which I think is very
               impressive. He and his wife might go
               back there after this year. I know this
               is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.

     Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill.

43   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                           43

     Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on
     his tray. He looks at the gang at their table. He sits with
     them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               My favorite time, though, is lunch because
               I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend
               the time working on Mary Elizabeth's
               fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror
               Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky.
               Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
               because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but
               somehow she always acts like my father at
               the end of a "long day."
                                                                     30.


44   INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON                                         44

     The xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY! Halloween Issue!
     Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               Her best friend Alice loves vampires and
               wants to go to film school. She also
               steals jeans from the mall. I don't know
               why because her family is rich, but I'm
               trying not to be judgemental. Especially
               since I know how they were all there for
               Patrick last year. Patrick never likes
               to be serious, so it took me awhile to
               get what happened.

     Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary
     Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life.

     [Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of
     Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.]

45   EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT                                    45

     Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the
     field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer. Moments later,
     Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field.

                         CHARLIE
               When he was a junior, Patrick started
               seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I
               guess it was hard, too, because Brad had
               to get drunk every time they fooled
               around.

46   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                           46

     Patrick whispers while the gang studies their SAT books.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               Then, Monday in school, Brad would say,
               "Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember
               a thing." This went on for 7 months.

47   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING                   47

     Charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes. He
     turns to see Brad with his father and mother. Proper family.
     Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               When they finally did it, Brad said he
               loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry.
                                                                    31.
                         CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               saying his dad would kill him. And
               saying he was going to hell.

48   INT. LIBRARY - DAY                                              48

     We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library. They reach
     the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they
     simply... PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               Patrick was eventually able to help Brad
               get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt
               sad that he had to keep it a secret, and
               he said no because at least now, Brad
               doesn't have to get drunk to love him.

     Brad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie
     and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying
     hard for her SAT's.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I think that I understand because I
               really like Sam. I asked my sister about
               her, and she said that when Sam was a
               freshman, the upper classmen used to get
               her drunk at parties. I guess she had a
               reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate
               for her to judge me based on what I used
               to be like.

49   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                   49

     We see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box.

                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
               So, I've been making her a mix tape so
               she will know how I feel.

     The two cassettes run. The song is just about to finish
     when... the side runs out of tape and snaps off.

                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Ah, shit!

50   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 50

     The marquee announces it's time for the...

51   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 51

     ... Rocky Horror Picture Show! The ROCKY EMCEE, dressed as
     Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy.
                                                                      32.


              ROCKY EMCEE                           CROWD
     Gimme an R! Gimme an O!           R-O-C-K-Y!   Rocky!   Rocky!
     Gimme a C! Gimme a K! Gimme       Rocky!
     a Y! What's that spell!?

     The crowd cheers!   Charlie claps from the front row.

52   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER                      52

     The movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in
     the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly.
     Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't
     Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in
     full drag is... Patrick.

                         PATRICK
               Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That
               delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung
               to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause
               I wanted to be dressed just the same.

     Patrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his
     ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing!
     Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling.

                         PATRICK (CONT'D)
               Give yourself over to absolute pleasure.
               Swim the warm waters of sins of the
               flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any
               measure. And sensual daydreams to
               treasure forever. Can't you just see it?
               Woah oh oh!

     Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick,
     Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with
     a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie
     watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt).

53   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT                     53

     We hear the chorus of "Don't Dream It, Be It" as Charlie
     watches all of the exciting cast members at the after-show
     party. Charlie sees a photo of Sam's naked back on the wall
     of Craig's loft. Very arty. Very black & white. Charlie's
     lust (and guilt) are now at 11. Alice looks at the photo.

                         ALICE
               It's gorgeous, Craig.    What did you use?

     Craig is impressive to high school kids. He's a little
     pretentious. But his art school life. His red wine. His
     loft. Wow. Right now, he holds court in the wine line.
                                                                    33.


                         CRAIG
               Color film, but black and white paper for
               the printing. My professor gave me an
               "A," but for the wrong reasons. Most of
               them are idiots. You'll see what I mean
               when you get to college. How were your
               SAT's by the way?

                         ALICE
                   (worried)
               1150. I think I'll get into NYU.

                         CRAIG
               Yeah, I hope so.

                         MARY ELIZABETH
                   (cruel to Alice)
               1490. Harvard. Face!

54   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                     54

     Charlie sees Sam alone on the loft steps. She looks a little
     down. He hands Sam a plastic cup and sits next to her.

                           CHARLIE
               Hey.    Are you okay?

                          SAM
               Yeah.   Yeah. But I got my SAT results
               back.   Oops.

                         CHARLIE
               You can take them again.

                         SAM
               Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn
               State main campus, I have to do much
               better. I wish I would have studied
               freshman year. I was a bit of a mess.

                         CHARLIE
               I'll help you study for the next one.

                           SAM
               Will you?

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah, of course.

                         SAM
               Thanks, Charlie.

     Charlie summons his courage.      He hands her the mix tape.
                                                                     34.


                         SAM (CONT'D)
               What's this?

                         CHARLIE
               Just a mix tape. No big deal. My
               parents have a pretty good stereo. It's
               all about that night in the tunnel. I
               couldn't find that song we were listening
               to, but I'm still searching for it, so--

                         SAM
               It's okay. These are great.   You have
               really good taste, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
               Really?

                         SAM
               Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman.
               I used to listen to the worst top 40.

                         CHARLIE
               No.

                         SAM
               Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old
               song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I
               thought someday I would be at a party in
               college or something. And I'd look up
               and see this person across the room. And
               from that moment, I'd know everything was
               going to be okay. You know what I mean?

                         CHARLIE
                   (devastated in love)
               Yeah.

55   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER                              55

     The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad.
     Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade. Like
     she is dancing with him. But she isn't. A wider angle
     reveals that she is slow dancing with... Craig.

     Charlie is 15 year old CRUSHED. No filter. Just feeling.
     Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room.

                         ALICE
               So, what do you think?

                         PATRICK
               I don't know.
                                                                    35.


                         ALICE
               I hope it works out. Craig would be a
               big step up from her last boyfriend.

                            MARY ELIZABETH
               No, shit.     Who could forget Mr. Car Wash
               Loser?

                         PATRICK
               I just hope she stops playing dumb with
               these guys. I keep telling her... don't
               make yourself small. You can't save
               anybody.

     Craig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends. Sam goes into the
     kitchen. Craig approaches Charlie. Turns off his mix tape.

                         CRAIG
               Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How
               about something a little more upbeat?

     Craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down.

                         CRAIG (CONT'D)
               Sam tells me you want to be a writer.

                            CHARLIE
               Yeah.

                         ALICE
               Don't you write poetry, Craig?

                            CRAIG
               No.     Poetry writes me.   You know?

     Charlie sighs. Craig's upbeat song begins to play. He
     dances over to Sam. Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam
     hug on Craig.

56   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     56

     In a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers.
     Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall.

57   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING                                    57

     The bell rings.    Charlie sets down his On the Road paper.

                           BILL
               Wow.    That was fast.   You want another
               one?
                                                                   36.


     Charlie nods. Bill smiles and reaches into his desk. He
     hands Charlie a copy of A Separate Piece. Charlie takes the
     book and starts to walk out, but he turns back.

                         CHARLIE
               Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something?

                         BILL
               Yeah.

                         CHARLIE
               Why do nice people choose the wrong
               people to date?

                         BILL
               Are we talking about anyone specific?

     Charlie nods. Bill looks straight at him. Not preaching.
     Coming from a history of personal experience and pain.

                         BILL (CONT'D)
               We accept the love we think we deserve.

                         CHARLIE
               Can we make them know they deserve more?

                         BILL
               We can try.

     Charlie smiles.

58   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - MORNING                         58

     Charlie waits nervously at a booth. He sees Sam enter. He
     fixes his hair, then pretends to read his SAT PREP BOOK.

                         SAM
               Hey, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
               Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.     You
               want to work on probabilities and
               statistics?

     Sam nods. They open their books, and a Christmas song
     begins. In a quick passage of time, we see them study next
     to Halloween decorations. Then, Thanksgiving. And finally,
     Christmas decorations.

59   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   59

     The song continues. Charlie's mom and sister hang the
     Christmas ornaments as Charlie helps his dad find that "one
                                                                    37.


                           CHARLIE
               Hey, dad.    Can I have 30 dollars?

                          FATHER
                    (old joke)
               20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars
               for?

                         CHARLIE
               Sam is doing secret santa. It's her
               favorite thing in the world. Please.

     Charlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a
     bill. It's a fifty. Dad winks, in a great mood.

                           FATHER
               Have fun.

                           CHARLIE
               Thanks.

60   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY                               60

     Lockers are opened by Charlie. Sam. Patrick. Wrapped gifts
     are deposited. Mischief smiles. Lockers closed. Everyone
     loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks.

61   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                                 61

     Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the
     Rye. He smiles.

                         BILL
               Charlie... this was my favorite book
               growing up. This is my copy, but I want
               you to have it.

                           CHARLIE
               Thanks.

                         BILL
               Have a great Christmas break.

                         CHARLIE
               You too, Mr. Anderson.

62   INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY                                           62

     Mr. Callahan, the shop teacher, looks at a Sad Sack Girl's
     clock. He takes a moment, and then...

                         MR. CALLAHAN
               Terrible stain.
                                                                     38.


     He moves to Charlie's dad's amazing clock.   He hands Charlie
     an A on a piece of paper.

                         MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)
               That's pretty good, Charlie.

     Mr. Callahan moves to Patrick's SHITTY WOODEN CLOCK. No
     stain. No finish. Lop-sided. The ugliest clock you've ever
     seen in your life.

                         MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)
               You've got to be kidding me.

                         PATRICK
               If you fail me, you get me next semester.

     Mr. Callahan writes a grade and slaps it down.

63   EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT                                   63

     The song continues as Patrick holds up the grade. C minus!
     Charlie and Sam cheer as Patrick screams at the top of his
     lungs...

                         PATRICK
               Woo! C Minus! It's over! It's over!
               Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!

                         SAM
               Below average!

     Patrick screams at the city in the distance.   Below average!

64   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT        64

     We move to find Sam, holding her SAT score up to the group.

                            SAM
               Hey, guys.     1210.

     Everyone cheers.   Sam hugs Charlie.

65   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - GAMES ROOM - NIGHT                65

     Charlie carries Sam on his shoulders past the Christmas Tree.
     Sam wears a Santa Hat like a hot elf.

                         SAM
               No more applications!   No more SAT's!
               Thank you, Charlie!

     They pass Mary Elizabeth as she opens her final present.
                                                                    39.


                    MARY ELIZABETH
          Multiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This
          is a really tough one, but I'm going to
          have to guess... Alice.

Alice smiles. Bob nudges her. Guilty as charged.       Mary
Elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag.

                    MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Wait, guys... a receipt! She actually
          paid!

                    PATRICK
          Impossible!

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          I'm so touched.

Alice laughs. Patrick pours everyone brandy.    The kids look
ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous.

                    CHARLIE
          Where's Craig?

                    SAM
          He went home to Connecticut.    He'll be
          back for New Year's Eve.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.

Sam nods, then turns. Charlie is delighted. No Craig.         The
kids settle in the living room in front of the fire.

                    SAM
          Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.    Who's
          your secret santa?

                    PATRICK
          I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I
          have received a harmonica, a magnetic
          poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and
          a mix with the song "Asleep" on it...
          twice.

Charlie starts snickering.    He can't help himself.

                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
          I mean, I have no idea. This collection
          of presents is so gay that I think I must
          have given them to myself. But despite
          that distinct possibility, I'm going to
          have to go with... drum roll... Charlie.
                                                           40.


Charlie holds up his hands.     Yay!   They all cheer.

                    SAM
          Alright, Charlie... it's your turn.

Charlie and Patrick switch places.       Charlie stands.

                    CHARLIE
          Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants,
          a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to
          wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing
          my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.

                     PATRICK
          Huh.   Now, why do you say that?

                     CHARLIE
          I don't know. She bosses people around
          sometimes.

The gang cracks up.   Mary Elizabeth is pissed.

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          What the hell is wrong with you?

                      CHARLIE
          Sorry.

                    PATRICK
          Well, you'll be surprised to know that
          your secret santa is actually... me.

                    CHARLIE
          You got me clothes?     Why?

                    PATRICK
          Because all the great writers used to
          wear great suits. Your last present is
          on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve
          into our facilities. Emerge a star.

Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents.

                    CHARLIE
          Can you hand these out while I'm gone?

                    MARY ELIZABETH
          Wait a second. There's only secret santa
          presents. There are rules, Charlie.

                    PATRICK
          Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat
          Christmas? Hand them out, Sam.
                                                                     41.


     Sam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice
     looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription...

                         ALICE
               "Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."

     Alice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with...

                         MARY ELIZABETH
               40 dollars.
                   (reads card)
               "To print Punk Rocky in color next time."

     Bob blows soap bubbles into the air.   Stoned.   Mesmerized.

                         BOB
               He knows me. He really knows me.

     Sam looks at her present. An old 45 record of The Beatles
     classic "Something" with a card. She reads the card. Holds
     it to her chest. Very moved.

                         SAM
               Come on out, Charlie.

     They all chime in. "Let's go, young man!" "Charlie!
     Charlie!" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his
     entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals...

     Charlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods
     in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the
     cover. They all clap. It's magic.

                          PATRICK
               Yeah!   What a display of man I have ever
               seen!

     Sam and Charlie look at each and smile.

66   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - LATER                                       66

     The door opens.   Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room.

                         CHARLIE
               Where are we going?

                         SAM
               It's a surprise.

     Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room
     is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says "The
     Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves." Virgin Mary
     icons. Snow globes. Kitsch.
                                                               42.


                    CHARLIE
          Is this your room?    It's so cool.

                      SAM
          Thanks.

Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.

                    CHARLIE
          You got me a present?

                    SAM
          With all that help on my Penn State
          application? Of course I did. Open it.

Charlie lifts up the box to reveal an OLD MANUAL TYPEWRITER.

                    CHARLIE
          I don't know what to say.

                    SAM
          You don't have to say anything.

Sam goes over and types. "Write about us sometime." He
smiles and types back. "I will." They look at each other.
We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry we can't be here for your
          birthday.

                    CHARLIE
          That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to
          go back and visit your dad.

                    SAM
          I'm in such a great mood, I don't think
          even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm
          finally doing good.

                      CHARLIE
          You are.

                    SAM
          Me? What about you? When I met you, you
          were this scared freshman. And look at
          you in that suit. You're like a sexy
          English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth
          checking you out.

                      CHARLIE
                (innocent laugh)
          No.
                                                               43.


                    SAM
          Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see
          you coming. And parents love you. That's
          like... extra danger.

                    CHARLIE
          Well, it hasn't worked so far.

                    SAM
          Come on. You've never had a girlfriend?
          Not even a 2nd grade valentine?

He shakes his head.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Have you ever kissed a girl?

                     CHARLIE
          No.   What about you?

                    SAM
          Have I ever kissed a girl?

                    CHARLIE
              (laughs)
          No! Your first kiss...

Sam gets this strange look in her eyes.    A little haunted.

                    SAM
          My first kiss? I was 11. His name was
          Robert. He would come over to the house
          all the time.

                    CHARLIE
          Was he your first boyfriend?

                    SAM
          He was my dad's boss.

Charlie goes silent.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          You know Charlie, I used to sleep with
          guys who treated me like shit. And get
          wasted all the time. But now... I feel
          like I have a chance. I could even get
          into a real college.

                       CHARLIE
          It's true.     You can do it.

                       SAM
                                                                   44.


                         CHARLIE
               My Aunt... she had that same thing done
               to her, too. And she turned her life
               around.

                         SAM
               She must have been great.

                         CHARLIE
               She was my favorite person in the
               world... until now.

     Sam smiles.   She's very moved.

                         SAM
               Charlie, I know that you know I like
               Craig. But I want to forget that for a
               minute. Okay? I just want to make sure
               that the first person who kisses you
               loves you. Okay?

     Charlie nods. And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him.
     It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him.
     Holding on for lonely life. When the song crescendos, and
     they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other. Finally...

                         SAM (CONT'D)
               I love you, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
               I love you, too.

67   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                           67

     The porch lights are as golden as Charlie feels right now.
     We see the girls wave to each other and hug Sam.

                         GANG
               "Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your
               dad's!" "See you at New Year's!"

     Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway.

                         CHARLIE
               Have a good time at your mom's.

                          PATRICK
               Thanks. And Charlie... since you were
               born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't
               get a lot of birthday presents. So, I
               thought you should have my clock. From
               the heart.
                                                                         45.


                           CHARLIE
                 Thank you, Patrick.

     Sam gives Charlie one last hug.       Patrick and Sam watch their
     friends leave.

                           PATRICK
                 I love you guys!

68   EXT. DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH - NIGHT                                     68

     We fly as high as Charlie feels.      Above the city on Christmas
     Eve.

69   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         69

     The front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad.

                            FATHER
                 Hey!   Look who's here!

     He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's
     older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19). Chris is handsome,
     charismatic, and an all around winner.

                           CHRIS
                 Come here, little sister.

                           CANDACE
                 Hey, Chris.

     Big hug.    Chris smiles big and "son flirts" with his mom.

                           CHRIS
                 Ma, you look so thin!

                           MOTHER
                 10 pounds... Weight Watchers.

     Big kiss.   When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles.

                              CHRIS
                 Charlie...

     Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence. Then, hug.
     As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris
     gives him a quiet...

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
                 Happy birthday.

70   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                           70
                                                                       46.


                         MOTHER
               Make a wish, honey.

     We move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out
     his 16 candles.

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

71   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                            71

     The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags.
     The suburb is quiet. Not a creature is stirring. Except...

     Charlie. He fills a brown paper bag with    sand and a candle.
     He lights the candle, making the bag glow   like a beautiful
     lantern. He looks down his street, where    families are out
     with their kids, doing the same luminaria   ritual.

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

72   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          72

     The same street. Christmas Eve. Many years ago. Aunt Helen
     and the kids finish their luminaria bags. Aunt Helen lights
     up the candles. They glow.

                         AUNT HELEN
               Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria
               is a landing strip for Santa Claus.

     The image goes wide. All of these bags glowing.     Beautiful.
     Aunt Helen rattles her keys. Whispers.

                         AUNT HELEN (CONT'D)
               Keep an eye out for him with your brother
               and sister. I'll be right back.

     She bends down and whispers into his ear.

                         AUNT HELEN (CONT'D)
               I'm going to get your birthday present.

     She musses his hair and gets in the car.

                                                       END FLASHBACK

73   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                            73

     Charlie hovers over the glowing luminaria.   Something is
     bothering him. He shakes it off.
                                                                      47.


74   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - NIGHT                74

     Charlie wanders through the quiet house. He turns the corner
     where he finds Chris sitting at the table. He's lit by a
     couple of candles and the blinking lights of the Christmas
     Tree. He's surrounded by leftovers. Charlie sits.

                            CHARLIE
               Hey.

     Chris chews and swallows.      Famished.   They both whisper.

                         CHRIS
               Hey. God, I missed mom's cooking.        You
               have no idea how good you have it.       I'm
               actually beginning to hate pizza.

     Charlie smiles.    Grabs a Hershey Kiss cookie.

                         CHARLIE
               How are you liking school?

                           CHRIS
               Not bad.    I'm no brainiac like you or
               Candace.    But I'm doing okay.

                           CHARLIE
               Okay?    You're playing in a Bowl Game.

     Chris laughs. Charlie smiles.      A moment passes.      Chris
     changes his tone. Cautious.

                         CHRIS
               How are you feeling, Charlie?

                            CHARLIE
               Good.

                         CHRIS
               You know what I mean.      Is it bad tonight?

                            CHARLIE
               No.

                            CHRIS
               No?

                         CHARLIE
               I'm not picturing things anymore. And
               when I do, I can just shut it off.

                            CHRIS
                      (relieved)
                                                                      48.
                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               now. And maybe if it does get bad again,
               you can just talk to them, yeah?

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask
               her out at New Years. I think the time
               is right now.

     Chris smiles at his kid brother.   We hear the church organ.

75   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH - MORNING                             75

     The family moves down the line to receive Holy Communion at
     Christmas Mass. Charlie's father, then mother, then sister,
     take the sacrament. Charlie is next. The PRIEST makes the
     motion of the cross with the communion wafer. He places it
     in Charlie's hand. Charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth
     with his fingers...

                                                      MATCH CUT TO:

76   INT. BOB'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    76

     We move in closer to Charlie's fingers in his mouth. When he
     takes his hand out, we see... a tab of LSD. The church organ
     is now a rock organ. And it's now... New Year's Eve.

     Charlie closes his mouth. He looks down the hall of the
     smoky room where Craig has his arm around Sam. Charlie turns
     to Mary Elizabeth, who's also dosed.

                         CHARLIE
               How long does this take to work?

77   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          77

     About 45 minutes. The sound is muted thick. Slight echoes.
     Charlie shovels the snow. Crunch. Fascinated by his breath
     making fog. Sam comes outside. She's worried about him.

                         SAM
               Shoveling snow, huh?

                         CHARLIE
               I have to get this driveway clean. Then,
               I have to congratulate you for being
               happy because you deserve it.

                         SAM
               You said that an hour ago.

                         CHARLIE
               Was that tonight? God. I was looking at
               this tree, but it was a dragon, and then
                                                                    49.


                         SAM
               Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out. Just
               give me the shovel. Calm down. Look up.

     She points.   Charlie looks up.   Sees the stars.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
               Isn't it quiet?

                         CHARLIE
               Sam, you ever think that if people knew
               how crazy you really were, no one would
               ever talk to you?

                         SAM
               All the time. So, you want to put on
               these glasses? They'll protect you.

     Sam puts her arm around his shoulder. Protecting him.
     Charlie looks through the glasses. The sky bends like a
     globe. When he breathes, the sky ripples.

78   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        78

     Charlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind.
     He sits down on the sofa. The world unbends as Charlie takes
     off the glasses. Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts
     of themselves behind.

     Charlie looks upstairs to find... Sam and Craig kissing.
     Craig leads her to the bedroom.

     Charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the New
     Years countdown. Patrick leads the charge.

                           PATRICK
               10-9-8...

79   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                       79

     In a QUICK FLASH, we see 7 year old Charlie with Aunt Helen
     on Christmas Eve. She bends to whisper in his ear.

                         AUNT HELEN
               It'll be our little secret, all right?

80   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT (PRESENT)                              80

     We are BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie takes a deep breath and
     tries to remember that he's at a New Year's party.

                         PATRICK
               7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year!
                                                                      50.


     The crowd cheers, leaving ghosts of themselves.   Charlie gets
     up from the sofa and walks out of Bob's house.

81   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT                                     81

     Charlie walks down the road under a streetlight. Silhouette.
     The road is icy. Charlie lays down and starts moving his
     arms in the snow. The memories begin to haunt him.

82   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         82

     7 year old Charlie waves goodbye to Aunt Helen as she drives
     away through the landing strip for Santa Claus.

83   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                           83

     16 year old Charlie blinks.   The memories come faster.

84   INT. AUNT HELEN'S CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         84

     Aunt Helen drives past a tall snow drift. She looks down at
     the 45 of The Beatles in the seat next to her. She smiles at
     Charlie's birthday present. Then, she looks up as the
     headlights of the semi truck smash the windows with a CRASH!

85   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          85

     Charlie's mother opens the door, revealing a POLICEMAN. He
     turns to Charlie in his party hat. 7 years old and confused.

86   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                           86

     16 year old Charlie lays on the snow, shivering, as the image
     goes high above to reveal he's made a snow angel.

87   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON                                    87

     The Emergency room is bustling on New Year's Day. Charlie
     looks up as the POLICE, DOCTORS, and his PARENTS tower over
     him. He is terrified and does what any kid would do. He
     lies his ass off.

                         POLICEMAN
               Did your older friends pressure you?

                         CHARLIE
               No one pressured me into anything. I
               would never do drugs, officer. Never.

                         POLICEMAN
               Then, how did you happen to be passed out
               on the ground at 6 in the morning?
                                                                      51.


                         CHARLIE
               Well, um... I was really tired, and uh...
               I was feeling feverish. So, I went
               outside for a walk, just to get some cold
               air. And I started seeing things. So, I
               passed out.

     He waits to see if this worked.    And then, unexpectedly...

                         MOTHER
                   (worried)
               You're seeing things again, Charlie?

                          CHARLIE
                   (oops)
               Not, uh... Not really.

88   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - MORNING               88

     The tires squish the grey slush puddle as the busses pull
     into the dreary parking lot. School is back in session.

89   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                            89

     Charlie shakes off the cold, then takes off his overcoat to
     reveal... he's wearing his suit from Secret Santa. All the
     kids stare. Charlie realizes he made a terrible mistake.

                         CHARLIE
               It was a Christmas present.

90   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                                   90

     Charlie sits as Bill hands out the book for the semester...
     The Great Gatsby. As the kids chatter, Bill gives Charlie
     his own book to start the year... The Stranger.

                         CHARLIE
               Did you have fun on your break?

                         BILL
               More fun than you're going to have today,
               Sinatra.

     Bill pats his shoulder and moves on.    The Smart Ass Freshman
     looks at Charlie and whispers.

                         SMART ASS FRESHMAN
               Nice look, jag off.

91   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                      91

     The Rocky Horror faithful enter the theater.
                                                                      52.


                         SAM (O.S.)
               I called him 30 times.

92   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT         92

     Mary Elizabeth and the kids get ready for the floor show.

                         MARY ELIZABETH
               Well what are we supposed to do?     We're
               going on in 10 minutes!

     The phone rings. Mary Elizabeth picks up. Charlie turns to
     Brad, sitting next to him. Charlie is freaking out.

                         CHARLIE
               But they said in health class--

                         BRAD HAYS
               They say that about LSD to scare you.

                         CHARLIE
               Are you sure?

                         BRAD HAYS
               Charlie, you're fine, man.

     Mary Elizabeth hangs up the phone, frustrated.

                         MARY ELIZABETH
               Guys, we have an emergency. Craig flaked
               out on us again. I need a Rocky. Brad?

                         BRAD HAYS
                   (scared)
               No way. There are people out here.

     The group is deflated. They all start thinking.        After a
     beat, Mary Elizabeth looks at Charlie.

                         MARY ELIZABETH
               Charlie... take off your clothes.

93   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER                      93

     You know those dreams you have when you are standing in front
     of 200 people in your underwear? Well, this is no dream.

     We hear a heart beat as Charlie dances out of the Rocky gauze
     and finds himself standing in tight gold underwear, looking
     out at 200 people, cheering him on.

     His friends can't stop smiling. Especially Mary Elizabeth,
     who watches Charlie's little butt in the gold undies. She
                                                                   53.


94   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER                   94

     "Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me" is in full swing. Sam slinks
     over to Charlie dressed in her white bra and slip.

                         SAM
                   (as Janet)
               So if anything grows while you pose.
               I'll oil you up and drop you down. And
               that's just one small fraction of the
               main attraction. You need a friendly
               hand. And I need action!

     Sam grabs Charlie's hands and rubs them all over her chest.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
               Ah! Touch a touch a touch me! I wanna
               be dirty! Thrill me. Chill me. Fulfill
               me! Creature of the night!

     The song continues. We see flashes of the night's
     performance as Charlie goes from train wreck to triumph.
     Charlie joins Sam in the kick line, and it feels like it's
     just the two of them. On the final beat, Sam gasps...

                         SAM (CONT'D)
               Creature of the night!

     The song ends. The cast bows. Sam and Patrick push Charlie
     in front for his own curtain call. Everyone cheers. It's
     the night he'll never forget.

95   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                   95

     The wind whips. That bracing February cold. Charlie helps
     Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car.

                         CHARLIE
               Maybe I could join the cast as an
               alternate or something?

                         MARY ELIZABETH
               We're filled up now, but they'll need
               people after we leave for college. I
               could put in a good word for you.

                         CHARLIE
               That'd be great. Thanks.

     They put the box in her trunk. Snap it closed. We can't
     help but notice the "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" bumper
     sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt.
                                                                      54.


                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Charlie... have you heard of the Sadie
                Hawkins dance?

                          CHARLIE
                The one where the girl asks the guy.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely
                stupid and sexist. It's like, "Hey,
                thanks for the crumb." And normally, I'd
                just blow it off because school dances
                suck torture. But, you know, it's my
                last year, and... would you maybe want to
                go with me?

                          CHARLIE
                You want to go with me?

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked
                really cute in your costume. So, what do
                you say?

     Charlie thinks and thinks and...

96   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK                                       96

     Ding dong. Charlie's mom opens the door for MARY ELIZABETH.
     Charlie straightens out his church suit. So nervous.

                          MOTHER
                You must be Mary Elizabeth.    It's so good
                to meet you.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

                          FATHER
                    (shit eating grin)
                Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.

97   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - FIREPLACE - DUSK                           97

     Charlie and Mary Elizabeth stand next to Candace and Derek.

                          FATHER
                OK, a little closer together. That looks
                nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a
                little bit more. There you go. Nice.

     Cheese!   White flash.   The picture of 4 kids.   Smiling big.
                                                                    55.


98   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                 98

     Charlie and Mary Elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song.
     Sweaty palms. Awkward. Hands on hips. Horror.

     Charlie looks around the gym. He sees Alice dancing with her
     date, an EFFEMINATE GOTH KID (17). We'll never meet him, but
     he'll make us laugh once.

     Charlie then watches Patrick dance with Sam. He follows
     Patrick's gaze across the floor to Brad, who dances with a
     SENIOR GIRL (18). Charlie sees the boys look at each other.
     For one moment, it's like they're dancing together.

99   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER                 99

     Mary Elizabeth is at the punch bowl with the gang. Charlie
     sees Sam, standing by the wall, looking sad. He approaches.

                         CHARLIE
               Are you having a good time?

                         SAM
               Not really. How about you?

                         CHARLIE
               I don't know. This is my first date, so
               I don't know what to compare it to.

                         SAM
               Don't worry. You're doing fine.

     Charlie joins her at the wall.   Mary Elizabeth gives them a
     quick, jealous look.

                         CHARLIE
               I'm sorry Craig didn't come.

                         SAM
               Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to
               some stupid high school dance. Can't say
               I blame him.

                         CHARLIE
               I don't know. If you like it, he should
               come.

                         SAM
               Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first
               date. You deserve it.

                         CHARLIE
               I'll try not to make you too jealous.
                                                                       56.


      He said it to cheer her up.   Sam forces a smile and leaves.

100   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                    100

      Mary Elizabeth approaches Charlie on the antique sofa. She
      uncorks a bottle of wine. POP! She hands him the bottle.

                           MARY ELIZABETH
                Mmmm.   Now, let it breathe.

      Mary Elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable. She
      turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control. Roar!

                          CHARLIE
                This is sure a nice house.

                            MARY ELIZABETH
                Thanks.

      Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl LP. A Doo Wop
      make-out classic begins to play. She dances over to Charlie.

                          MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                Mmmm. Don't you just love old music?
                    (off his nod)
                Good. Because I made you a mix of it.
                I'd love to expose you to great things.
                Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.

      She pours the wine.   Charlie looks at the bottle.

                          CHARLIE
                This merlot is really fancy.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he
                doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?

                            CHARLIE
                I guess.    Where are your parents?

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Their club is hosting a cotillion or
                something racist. They'll be gone all
                night.

      Mary Elizabeth drops her necklace with a thud.   Charlie looks
      around. Heart beating.

                          CHARLIE
                That's sure a nice fire.
                                                                       57.


                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Yeah. After I'm done being a lobbyist, I
                want to move to a house like this in Cape
                Cod. That sounds nice, doesn't it?

                           CHARLIE
                Yeah.

      She reaches out and touches his chest.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Your heart is beating really fast.

                           CHARLIE
                Is it?

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Here, feel.

      She puts her hand on his.   Moves it to his chest.

                           MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                Charlie?

                           CHARLIE
                Uh-huh?

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Do you like me?

                           CHARLIE
                Uh-huh.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                You know what I mean.

                          CHARLIE
                I think so.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Don't be nervous.

      She slowly moves his hand to her dress strap. It falls off
      her shoulder. She leans in for a red wine kiss. She guides
      his hand over her bra. He feels her breast. Wow.

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

101   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S BASEMENT - FANTASY                         101

      For a quick moment, Charlie imagines he is kissing Sam.
      Broken by...
                                                                            58.


102   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                        102

      Mary Elizabeth moves his hand away. Charlie blinks, taking a
      moment to realize Sam's not the one in the room. The song is
      over. The needle turns at the end of the record.

                             MARY ELIZABETH
                Charlie...

      She gives him one last kiss.      Content, she lays down on his
      lap. Peaceful.

                          MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                I didn't know how it was going to go
                tonight, but it was really nice, huh?

                             CHARLIE
                Yeah.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                I can't believe it. You of all people.
                I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.

      We land on Charlie's face.       "What?"   And then, we hear the
      GARAGE DOOR OPEN.

                             MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                Oh, shit!     My parents!

      The mad scramble for clothes begins.

                                                                  CUT TO:

103   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          103

      Mary Elizabeth's car pulls in front of Charlie's house.
      Charlie gets out. Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend.
      Not knowing how. Mary Elizabeth smiles. Smitten.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                See you Monday.

      With that, she backs out of the driveway. We see him from
      the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller. His
      stomach already filling with acid.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't
                written for awhile, but things are a
                total disaster.
                                                                     59.


104   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                         104

      Sam, Patrick, and Alice are seated around the table. Mary
      Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie. Smothering him.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                We're literally making out, and I'm in my
                bra. Hello! And the front door opens.
                It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get
                my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe?

      Charlie nods, tortured.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I probably should have been honest about
                how I didn't want to go out with Mary
                Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really
                didn't want to hurt her feelings.

105   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING              105

      Ash Wednesday. Charlie gets out of the school bus to
      immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him. She sees
      the cross of ashes on his forehead. She thinks his ashes are
      a smudge. She cleans it.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice
                person underneath the part of her that
                hates everyone. And since I heard that
                having a girlfriend makes you happy, I
                tried hard to love her like I love Sam.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Can you believe it's almost our two week
                anniversary?

                          CHARLIE
                I know.

106   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                   106

      A double date. Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the
      silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                So, I took her on double dates.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                    (proud)
                Your first foreign film.

                          CHARLIE
                                                                      60.


                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Vegans don't eat butter.

      Charlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                And I tried not to mind that she loves to
                hold hands even when her hands are
                sweaty.

107   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   107

      Just like Sadie's except... the fire in the fireplace is out.
      We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary
      Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                And I had to admit something really
                upsetting. But I am tired of touching
                her boobs. I thought maybe if she would
                just let me pick the make-out music once
                in awhile, we might have a chance.

      Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo.   Sighs.

108   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                          108

      The gang is there.   Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                And maybe if she didn't put down the
                books that Mr. Anderson gives me.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Walden? I read it in 7th grade.    I would
                have called it "On Boring Pond."

109   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                              109

      Ring! Charlie grabs the cordless. He looks at Patrick's
      clock. 3:13pm. His voice can no longer hide his quiet rage.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Or if she would stop calling me the
                minute I get home from school when I have
                absolutely nothing to talk about other
                than the bus ride home...

                          MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                That dairy just sits with you. It walks
                with you.

      Charlie calmly puts down the phone and leaves the room.   We
                                                                       61.


110   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                           110

      Charlie is so miserable.   His mom is sympathetic.

                          MOTHER
                She's on the phone right now? Charlie,
                you have to break up with her.

                          CHARLIE
                I can do that?

      Charlie's father leans back from the sofa and his newspaper.

                          FATHER
                For Christ's sake... I need to use the
                phone!

111   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER                           111

      He returns.   Mary Elizabeth is still talking on the cordless.

                          MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                I'll give you this book. It's really how
                I became a vegan--

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I know I should have been honest, but I
                was getting so mad, it was starting to
                scare me.

      He looks back at the clock.   3:23pm.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you--

                          MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                Charlie. Please, don't interrupt.        You
                know I hate that.

      Charlie goes to his quiet place.   Tick.   Tick.    Tick.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I just wish I could have found another
                way to break up. In hindsight, I
                probably could not have picked a worse
                way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth.

112   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT                              112

      Truth or dare. The gang is seated in a circle, drinking from
      plastic cups. Charlie sits between Mary Elizabeth and Sam.

                           BOB
                                                              62.


                     PATRICK
           Who are you talking to?

                     BOB
           I dare you to kiss Alice.

                     PATRICK
               (licks his lips)
           Get ready, breeder.

As Patrick approaches an apprehensive Alice...

                     CRAIG
           Mary Elizabeth? Samantha told me that
           you got into Harvard. Congratulations.

                      MARY ELIZABETH
           Thank you.
               (re: Charlie)
           This one still hasn't gotten me flowers.
               (to Charlie)
           But I forgive you.

She kisses him. Charlie bites his cheeks.    Sam looks a
little depressed.

                     CRAIG
               (to Sam)
           Don't worry about Penn State.   You're
           just wait-listed.

                     PATRICK
           Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing
           some hot "fag on goth" action.

Anticipation. Patrick is getting ready to plant the biggest
kiss on Alice when she jumps him. Everyone groans. Ew!
Laughter. Patrick looks for the next person. Charlie's
heart pounds. Don't pick me! Please!

                     PATRICK (CONT'D)
           Okay. My turn. Um... let's think...
           Charlie... truth or dare?

Silence.   Thinking.   Finally...

                       CHARLIE
           Truth.

                     PATRICK
           How is your first relationship going?
                                                                       63.


                          CHARLIE
                It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that
                one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't
                have to break up with her.

                           PATRICK
                Charlie?   Truth or dare?

      Charlie blinks.   It was all fantasy.

                           CHARLIE
                Dare.

                          PATRICK
                I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in
                the room on the lips. Notice I
                charitably said girl and not person
                because let's face it... I'd smoke all
                you bitches.

      Alice hits him. Laughter. Charlie thinks. He looks at Mary
      Elizabeth, then turns to Sam. Before Sam can even react...
      Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips. When he opens his
      eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his
      mistake. Everyone stares. After a horrible silence...

                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
                Now that's fucked up.

      Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and
      goes into the kitchen.

                          CHARLIE
                Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm--

      Alice follows Mary Elizabeth.    Sam is close behind.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
                anything by it. I'm sorry.

      Sam turns and looks at him.    She doesn't even recognize him.

                          SAM
                What the hell is wrong with you?

      Charlie is devastated.

113   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         113

      They move to the driveway.     Charlie feels awful.   Panicky.

                           CHARLIE
                                                                          64.


                             PATRICK
                 Trust me.    You don't want to go back
                 there.

                           CHARLIE
                 But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to
                 do anything.

                           PATRICK
                 I know you didn't, but look... I hate to
                 be the one to break this, but there's
                 history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam.
                 Other guys. Things that have nothing to
                 do with you. But... it's best if you
                 stay away for awhile.

                           CHARLIE
                     (crushed)
                 Oh. Okay. How long do you think?

      Silence. Charlie looks over at Patrick, who wears a grave
      expression. It's going to be a long time. We hear the sound
      of the typewriter.

114   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING                                    114

      Charlie sits at his desk. It looks like he's barely slept.
      He begins typing. The keys up close and loud. Clak.

      CLOSE UP TYPING: "Dear friend, I have not seen my friends for
      2 weeks now. I am starting to get bad again."

      Charlie stares at the typewriter.    And remembers.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

115   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          115

      Little Charlie pops his head around the corner from the
      hallway. He looks at something we can't see yet.

                                                               BACK TO:

116   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING (PRESENT)                          116

      Present.   Knock.   Knock.   Charlie's mom opens the door.

                           MOTHER
                 We're going to be late for Easter Mass.

                           CHARLIE
                 I'll... I'll be there in a minute.
                                                                         65.


      Charlie forces a smile, then looks back at the typewriter.
      And tries to shake off the memory.

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

117   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         117

      Little Charlie looks at Aunt Helen as she smokes her
      cigarette and sobs.

                                                              BACK TO:

118   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH - MORNING                              118

      Charlie is lost. His family sits in the pews for Easter
      Mass. Charlie watches the PRIEST recite the Lord's prayer.

                          PRIEST
                Our Father who art in Heaven. Hallowed
                be Thy name. Thy kingdom come--

119   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH - MORNING (FLASHBACK)                  119

      7 year old Charlie watches the PRIEST recite the Lord's
      prayer. He looks at Aunt Helen's picture on the coffin.

                          PRIEST
                Thy will be done on earth as it is in
                Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.

120   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH - MORNING (PRESENT)                    120

      16 year old Charlie looks haunted by the memory.

                          PRIEST
                And forgive us our trespasses as we
                forgive those who trespass against us--

      The voices drift away and all Charlie can see is...

                                                               CUT TO:

121   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                         121

      7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand to make her stop
      crying.

                                                               CUT TO:

122   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH - MORNING (PRESENT)                       122

      16 year old Charlie blinks as the voices come back.

                             PRIEST
                   And lead us not into temptation.   But
                   deliver us from--

123   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                        123

      Charlie on the phone.     His voice wavers a bit.     Desperate.

                             CHARLIE (V.O.)
                   Mary Elizabeth... I... uh... I've been
                   listening to the Billie Holiday CD every
                   night and--

                             MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                   It's too late, Charlie.

                             CHARLIE
                   I know. I just feel really bad about
                   what I did. I just get so messed up
                   inside like I'm - not there or something.

                             MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                   Tell it to someone who cares.

                             CHARLIE
                   I know. I'm sorry. I just.     We've all
                   become such good friends--

                             MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                   Good friends? You mean the people I've
                   known since kindergarten that you've
                   known for 6 months? Those good friends?

                             CHARLIE
                   Oh. Yeah. I mean I don't want to do
                   anything to ruin our--

                             MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
                   It's ruined. Okay? So, stop calling
                   everyone. Stop embarrassing yourself.

                              CHARLIE
                   Okay.   I will. Goodbye, Mar--

      Dial tone.    Charlie hangs up the phone.
                                                                      67.


124   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - NIGHT                                     124

      Charlie is terribly anxious.   He watches Bob groom some pot.

                          CHARLIE
                Something's wrong with me--

                          BOB
                Don't worry about it.   Hey... you hear
                from Patrick?

                           CHARLIE
                No.   He told me to stay away.

                          BOB
                Oh... you don't know?

                          CHARLIE
                    (concerned)
                Why? Why? What happened?

                          BOB
                Brad's father caught them together.

125   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING                 125

      As kids open lockers and move to morning period, Charlie
      stares at Brad. He has a black eye and cuts on his face. He
      look like he was beaten up badly. Students whisper gossip.

                          GOSSIP WHISPERS (O.S.)
                "Some Lebo kids jumped him outside the
                O." "It was some kids from North Hills."
                "That's not what I heard."

      Brad moves into the arms of CHARLOTTE (18), cheerleader cute.
      As Brad kisses her, Charlie sees Patrick down the hall,
      watching them. Patrick closes his locker. Hurting.

                          CHARLIE
                Are you okay?

                          PATRICK
                Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.

      Patrick storms off.

126   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                          126

      Charlie sits at his table, alone. He watches Patrick leave
      the lunch line, passing a chorus of...

                            TWIN SENIOR GIRLS
                                                             68.


Patrick says nothing. He's too sad to fight the mob today.
He just moves to his table when the Nose Tackle sticks out
his leg. Patrick falls on his tray. The kids laugh.

                     NOSE TACKLE
          Oops.   Sorry, Nothing.

Patrick smiles to himself, dusts off, and turns to Brad.

                    PATRICK
          You going to do something?

                    BRAD HAYS
          What are you talking about?

                    PATRICK
          Your pet ape just tripped me.    Are you
          going to say something?

                    BRAD HAYS
          Why would I?

                    PATRICK
          You know why.

It's too far.   Brad can feel people staring.

                    BRAD HAYS
          This is pathetic, man.    Your fixation on
          me.

Brad's friends laugh.   Patrick's eyes narrow.

                    PATRICK
          Do you want your friends to know how you
          got those bruises? Really?

                    BRAD HAYS
          I got jumped in a parking lot.

                    PATRICK
          Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know
          about Schenley Park?
              (to Brad's friends)
          Do you guys know about Schenley Park?

Brad stands and gets right in Patrick's face.

                    BRAD HAYS
          I don't know what kind of sick shit
          you're trying to pull.
              (real warning)
          But you better walk away now... Nothing.
                                                                    69.


                      PATRICK
           Fine.   Say hi to your dad for me.

Patrick turns and leaves.    And then, as an afterthought...

                     BRAD HAYS
           Whatever... faggot.

Brad's friends laugh.    Patrick stops and turns.   Last chance.

                     PATRICK
           What did you call me?

                     BRAD HAYS
           I called you a faggo--

Smack.

Before Brad can even finish, Patrick throws a vicious right
to the cheek. Brad tackles him. And the two start fighting.
The cafeteria erupts in NOISE.

                     PATRICK
           Say that shit again!    Say that shit
           again!

Brad's football buddies rise and peel Patrick off Brad.     Mary
Elizabeth and Sam jump up from their corner table.

                     MARY ELIZABETH
           It's Patrick!

The cafeteria gets louder. The Nose Tackle holds Patrick up.
More Noise. The Linebacker hits Patrick in the face.

                       SAM
           No!   No!

Sam rushes up and the Nose Tackle pushes her down. She lands
on her tail bone. Thud. Patrick gets hit a couple of times
in the face. The kids cheer the fight. It's getting louder
and louder with more and more noise. And then...

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

Silence.

Charlie comes out from a blink. He calmly looks around. For
a moment, he doesn't understand where he is. He looks up.
All the kids are staring at him. Mary Elizabeth. Alice.
Brad. They are all quiet. Afraid of him. Charlie looks at
his hand, clenched in a fist. It is already covered with...
                                                                        70.


      Charlie's confused until he sees the Linebacker holding his
      broken, bloody nose. He's looking at Charlie...

      Terrified.

      The image pans over. The Nose Tackle is on the ground.
      Charlie stands over them. He is disconnected. It's an out
      of body experience. He reaches out and helps Patrick to his
      feet. Then, he calmly turns and stares right through Brad.

                              CHARLIE
                        (icy calm)
                   If you touch my friends again, I'll blind
                   you.

      Brad is stunned.     So is everyone... except Sam.

127   INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                               127

      Charlie sits in the waiting room of the principal's office.
      He looks through the glass where Principal Small talks to
      Brad. After a beat, she pats Brad's shoulder and opens the
      door. Leaving Charlie and Brad alone in the waiting room.
      Just as Brad is about to leave...

                              BRAD HAYS
                   Charlie?

                              CHARLIE
                   Yeah?

                             BRAD HAYS
                   Thanks for stopping them.

                             CHARLIE
                   Sure, Brad.

      Brad doesn't look at him.     He just moves on.

128   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON             128

      Charlie exits the building. Kids stare at him. Then, look
      away. Charlie feels very lost until he sees... Sam. She
      smiles. It brings him back instantly. And then, gently...

                             SAM
                   How you doing, Charlie?

                             CHARLIE
                   I don't know. I keep trying, but... I
                   can't really remember what I did.

      Sam can see he's afraid of himself.      She nods, sympathetic.
                                                                         71.


                          SAM
                Do you want me to tell you?

                          CHARLIE
                    (scared)
                Yeah.

                          SAM
                You saved my brother.     That's what you
                did.

                          CHARLIE
                So, you're not scared of me?

                             SAM
                No.

                          CHARLIE
                And can we be friends again?

                             SAM
                Of course.

      The minute she hugs him, the numb goes away. She kisses the
      top of his head and puts her arm around his shoulder. They
      begin walking away.

                           SAM (CONT'D)
                Come on.   Let's go be psychos together.

129   INT. PATRICK AND SAM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                     129

      Mary Elizabeth looks at us because she wants us to know...

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                I'm dating Peter now.

      She motions to PETER.    College.   Glasses.   Good looking-ish.

                          MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                He's in college with Craig. He's
                opinionated, and we have intellectual
                debates. You were very sweet, but our
                relationship was too one-sided. I know
                this is hard for you.

                          CHARLIE
                I'm just glad you're happy.

                             MARY ELIZABETH
                Okay.

      Mary Elizabeth joins Peter.    Charlie looks at his friends.
                                                                   72.

      that says, "They forget. I don't." After a beat, Patrick
      comes downstairs. He looks sad with his bruises.

                          PATRICK
                Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                We're going to miss the movie.

                          CRAIG
                Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step.

      As Craig moves upstairs, Patrick approaches Charlie.

                          PATRICK
                Hey... you wanna get out of here?

                          CHARLIE
                Sure, Patrick.

130   EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT                               130

      Patrick drives Sam's truck up the hill to the overlook.

                          PATRICK (V.O.)
                I'll tell you something, Charlie. I feel
                good. You know what I mean? Maybe
                tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke
                place downtown. And this club off the
                strip. They don't card. And the
                Schenley Park scene. You gotta see the
                "fruit loop" at least one time.

131   EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT                               131

      Charlie and Patrick walk the lighted path, howling at the
      moon. Patrick holds a thermos, filled with who knows what.

                          PATRICK
                Oh, my God. My life is officially an
                after school special. Son of a bitch!

                          CHARLIE
                    (laughing)
                It kind of is. It so is.

      More laughter.   They arrive at the lookout.   They drink.

                          PATRICK
                So, you ever hear the one about Lily
                Miller?

                          CHARLIE
                I don't know.
                                                        73.


                    PATRICK
          Really? I thought your brother would
          have told you. It's a classic.

                     CHARLIE
          Maybe.

                    PATRICK
          So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker.
          And this was going to be the night they
          were going to lose their virginity. So,
          she did it really proper. She packed a
          picnic. Stole a bottle of wine.
          Everything was perfect, and they're just
          about to 'do it' when they realize they
          forgot the condoms. So, what do you
          think happened?

                    CHARLIE
          I don't know.

                    PATRICK
          They did it with one of the sandwich
          bags.

They start laughing and screaming.

                     CHARLIE
          Ew!   That's disgusting!

                   PATRICK
          Yes! It is! Let's keep the train
          rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie!

Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks...

                    CHARLIE
          Uh. Well... there was this girl named
          Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the
          4th grade--

                    PATRICK
          Mosquito bites. Promising.     Go.

                    CHARLIE
          And she let some of the boys feel them.

                    PATRICK
          That's your suburban legend?     Did you at
          least cop a feel?

                     CHARLIE
          No.
                                                            74.


                    PATRICK
          Of course not. You went home, listened
          to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self-
          esteem--

                      CHARLIE
          Fine!    Okay. Your turn.

Patrick walks over and sits down next to Charlie.

                    PATRICK
          Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this
          one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill.
          Guy's father didn't know about his son.
          So, he comes down into the basement one
          night when he's supposed to be out of
          town. Catches his son with another boy.
          So, he starts beating him. But not like
          the slap kind. Like the real kind. And
          the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're
          killing him." And the son just yells
          "Get out." And eventually the boyfriend
          just did.

Patrick stops.    Gripped by sad.   He can't shake.

                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
          Why can't you save anybody?

                    CHARLIE
          I don't know.

                    PATRICK
          Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could
          meet the love of my life any second now.
          Things will be different now, and that's
          good. I just need to meet a good guy.

                       CHARLIE
          Yeah.

Patrick looks at him. Charlie has never seen him so
vulnerable. After a beat... Patrick kisses Charlie on the
mouth. Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen. His
eyes open the whole time. A moment, then Patrick looks at
Charlie. He collapses into his chest.

                       PATRICK
          I'm sorry.

                    CHARLIE
          It's alright.
                                                                      75.


      Charlie holds his friend as Patrick begins to cry. And we
      leave them, the city lights small in the distance.

132   EXT. CITY HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                       132

      We see the truck glide down the highway.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I've been spending a lot of time with
                Patrick. He begins every night really
                excited.

133   EXT. SCHENLEY PARK - NIGHT                                      133

      Patrick and Charlie are parked at the entrance of Schenley
      Park. Patrick speaks, very animated, until...

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                He always says he feels free, and tonight
                is his destiny. But after awhile, he
                runs out of things to keep himself numb.

      ... the words leave him, and we can see how sad he really is.

134   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                    134

      Patrick hands Sam an envelope.   Sam holds it.   Pins and
      needles.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.

      Sam opens the letter. She reads. Tears instantly well up in
      her eyes. She leaves the room and walks down the hall.
      Patrick picks up the letter.

                          PATRICK
                    (reading)
                "We will require you to take our summer
                session at the main campus immediately
                following your high school graduation."
                    (off Charlie's look)
                She got in, Charlie.

      Charlie turns back to Sam.   She holds him with sweet relief
      and redemption.

135   INT. CAFETERIA - DAY                                            135

      Charlie laughs with his friends in the cafeteria.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                After that all Patrick could talk about
                                                                    76.
                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                did get into NYU Film School. Patrick is
                going to the University of Washington
                because he wants to be near the music in
                Seattle.

136   INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY                                         136

      Charlie and a group of students stand, looking up at the
      wall, which is covered with...

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                But he wasn't going to leave without
                organizing the best senior prank ever.

      ... All The Shop Tools Painted Pink

      The shop teacher, Mr. Callahan stares at the wall, furious.
      As the students gawk, Charlie smiles to himself.

137   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                        137

      Sam and the girls chat excitedly.   Summer is almost here.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Sam is going to leave right after
                graduation. It all feels very exciting;
                I just wish it were happening to me.

138   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                  138

      Charlie sits on his bed, finishing the letter.

                          CHARLIE
                Especially because ever since I blacked
                out in the cafeteria, it's been getting
                worse. And I can't turn it off this
                time.

      Charlie puts down the letter.

139   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                               139

      The kids pass their copies of The Great Gatsby up to the
      front, where Bill collects them for next year's freshmen.
      The class is buzzing loud.

                          BILL
                Guys, you want to pass your copies of
                Gatsby up to the front please? And I
                know it's the last day, but if we could
                just keep it to a dull roar, I'd
                appreciate it.

      The class quiets down.
                                                                      77.


                          BILL (CONT'D)
                Thank you for such a great year. I had a
                blast. I hope you did, too. And I hope
                you have a great time this summer on your
                vacations. Now, who here is going to be
                reading for pleasure this summer?

      Charlie looks to see if anyone is watching... then, decides
      to raise his hand anyway. Bill is proud.

                          BILL (CONT'D)
                Very good, Charlie. Who else?

      Charlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all
      year. She sighs. Nothing left to say to him.

140   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - LATER                                   140

      The last kids exit the classroom. Charlie walks down the
      aisle and stands in front of Bill.

                             BILL
                Last day.

                          CHARLIE
                Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my
                business, but have you decided... are you
                going to New York?

                          BILL
                Well, my wife and I like it here, and I
                think I might be better at teaching than
                writing.

      Charlie is relieved.    Bill is staying.

                          BILL (CONT'D)
                So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I
                could still give you books next year.

                           CHARLIE
                Yeah.   Yeah.

                          BILL
                I think you could write one of them one
                day.

                          CHARLIE
                    (fragile belief)
                Really?

                             BILL
                I do.
                                                                        78.


      Charlie is quiet.   Then...

                          CHARLIE
                You're the best teacher I ever had.

                             BILL
                Thank you.

      He gives Bill a shy sideways hug. The two men say nothing
      else. Charlie waves and leaves. Bill smiles to himself.

141   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                 141

      Times Square has nothing on these seniors. Charlie watches
      the gang on their last day of high school. When the clock
      hits 10 seconds to 3pm, all the students chant...

                          SAM & COMPANY
                10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2...

                          STUDENT (O.S.)
                Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here!

                             ALL
                1!

      They all cheer and hug each other. Patrick loses his mind
      with joy and charges down the hallway.

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

142   EXT. MILL GROVE FOOTBALL STADIUM - SUNSET                         142

      A brilliant sunset. We see the gang. In silhouette.
      Running up the bleachers after the sun.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Dear Friend... I wanted to tell you about
                us running. There was this beautiful
                sunset. And just a few hours before,
                everyone I love had their last day of
                high school ever. And I was happy
                because they were happy, even though I
                counted, and I have 1,095 days to go.

143   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - FIREPLACE - LATE AFTERNOON                 143

      Prom night. Charlie sees Candace posing for Dad's camera.
      For a moment, we think Candace went to prom with Derek.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I kept thinking about what school was
                going to be like without them as they
                                                                      79.


      As mom and dad move out of the way, we realize Candace is
      standing with her 3 best girlfriends. They look beautiful.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                My sister finally decided to break up
                with Derek and go stag with her
                girlfriends instead.

144   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - SUNSET                           144

      Prom night continues. The antique limo is so garish, it's
      great. Charlie snaps pictures with Sam's mom and Patrick's
      dad. Mary Elizabeth is with her boyfriend, Peter. Alice
      stands with Patrick, dashing in his Mod Suit Tux.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                And then there was Sam...

      The image moves to the front of the house, where Sam emerges.
      She wears a vintage flapper dress from the 20's. Radiant.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I've looked at her pictures since that
                night. I like to see how happy she was
                before she knew.

      Sam joins Craig. They kiss for the cameras, then run with
      the rest of the gang to the limosine.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                They were in a hotel suite after prom
                when the truth came out...

      The gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam
                the whole time. When I heard that, I
                kept thinking about the happy girl in
                these pictures. Because she doesn't have
                1,095 days to go.

145   EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON                                    145

      Graduation Day. The place is packed with graduating seniors
      and families. Charlie's mom and dad fawn over Candace with
      the video camera. Charlie finally finds... Sam.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                She made it. This is her time. And no
                one should be able to take that away.

      They approach each other and hug.
                                                                       80.


                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                 Congratulations.

                           PATRICK
                 Oh, Charlie's here! Guys, group photo!
                 We should all take a group photo. Get
                 against the railing and try to look
                 suave!

      The kids line up for the picture they will always remember.

                           PATRICK (CONT'D)
                 Yeah, this is the one. That's going to
                 be a great angle.

      Patrick bows to reveal the top of his cap reads, "Nothing
      Hates You." The parents line up cameras. "Cheese!" Snap.

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

146   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               146

      The grandfather clock reads 9:30pm. The room is festive
      under streamers wishing Sam luck at Penn State. The kids
      sign each other's yearbooks. Charlie sees Sam smile at old
      photos. He misses her already.

                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
                 At her going away party, I wanted her to
                 know about that night we went through the
                 tunnel. And how for the first time, I
                 felt like I belonged somewhere.

                                                             CUT TO:

147   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - LATER               147

      10:28pm. Charlie doesn't know where the time keeps going.
      Sam opens goodbye presents from her friends.

                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
                 And tomorrow, she's leaving. So, I
                 wanted to give her a part of me.

      Charlie watches Sam pick up his present. She carefully peels
      the tape to reveal that Charlie gave her all of his books.

                           SAM
                 Are these all your books, Charlie?

      He nods.   They lock eyes and do not speak.
                                                                      81.


148   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      148

      The pictures are down. The dressers empty. The suitcase is
      open on the bed. Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put
      them in her suitcase. He has promised himself he will not
      cry. Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of "Something."

      Instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail.
      Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice.

                          SAM
                Thanks for staying up with me.

                          CHARLIE
                Sure. My brother said Penn State has a
                restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.
                You have to get a grilled stickie on your
                first night. It's a tradition.

                          SAM
                That sounds like fun.

                          CHARLIE
                Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
                new group of friends, and you won't even
                think about this place anymore.

                          SAM
                Yes, I will.

      Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.   They
      stand next to each other. Close.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                I had lunch with Craig today.

                          CHARLIE
                Yeah?

                          SAM
                He said he was sorry, and that I was
                right to break up with him. But I'm
                driving away, and I just felt so small.
                Just asking myself why do I and everyone
                I love pick people who treat us like
                we're nothing?

                          CHARLIE
                We accept the love we think we deserve.

      He says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in.
      Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she
      turns to him.
                                                                    82.


                       SAM
             Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?

Charlie didn't expect that.       He is silent.   Heart pounding.

                       CHARLIE
             I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted
             that.

                       SAM
             Well, what did you want?

                       CHARLIE
             I just want you to be happy.

                       SAM
             Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel
             that. It's really sweet and everything,
             but you can't just sit there and put
             everybody's lives ahead of yours and
             think that counts as love. I don't want
             to be somebody's crush. I want people to
             like the real me.

                       CHARLIE
             I know who you are, Sam.

Sam waits.    And Charlie finally speaks from the heart.

                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
             I know I'm quiet, and I know I should
             speak more, but if you knew the things
             that were in my head most of the time,
             you'd know what it really meant. How
             much we are alike. And how we've been
             through the same things. And you're not
             small. You're beautiful.

He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses
her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's
heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing.

We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she
touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like
he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water.

                       SAM
             What's wrong, Charlie?

                       CHARLIE
             Oh, ah... nothing.

Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues
                                                                      83.


149   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          149

      It's like a dream for Charlie. He watches Sam hug Alice and
      Mary Elizabeth goodbye. But Charlie is somewhere else.

                          SAM
                I'll call all the time.

                           MARY ELIZABETH
                Promise.

                          SAM
                And we'll all see each other in New York.

                          SAM'S MOM
                Come on, Sam.

      Charlie can't take it. He moves to the side of the truck and
      puts in the last suitcase. He looks over at Sam.

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

150   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      150

      QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers kissing Sam the night
      before. Her hand touches Charlie's knee.

                                                   BACK TO PRESENT:

151   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          151

      Charlie snaps himself out of it. He turns back as Mary
      Elizabeth and Alice part ways. Charlie locks eyes with Sam.
      They take a moment. And then they come together to hug. She
      kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry.

      After a moment, Sam climbs into the driver's seat of her
      truck with Patrick riding shotgun. Charlie looks dazed.

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

152   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      152

      QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers pulling away from Sam.
      Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost.

                          SAM
                What's wrong, Charlie?

                                                   BACK TO PRESENT:
                                                                          84.


153   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                              153

      Sam starts the truck. Charlie wants to scream for her to
      stop. But he's frozen. She drives away. He watches her go.
      The truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the
      stop sign. And disappears. Charlie stands there, alone.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

154   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                          154

      QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers the night with Sam. We see
      her put her hand on his knee. The image moves up the arm.
      To the shoulder. To the face. And we reveal, we are not in
      Sam's bedroom. And it is not Sam touching Charlie. But...

      Aunt Helen

                             AUNT HELEN
                   Don't wake your sister.

                                                       BACK TO REALITY:

155   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                              155

      The memory only registers as a small blink of his eye.
      Charlie sees his friends are crying. He's not. He's numb.

156   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                      156

      Charlie walks down the street. His eyes far away. The
      images and memories are short, violent bursts. If you've
      never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels.

157   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                           157

      QUICK FLASH. It's Christmas Eve.       Aunt Helen smiles to
      Little Charlie.

                             AUNT HELEN
                   It'll be our little secret, okay?

      Little Charlie nods.

158   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING (PRESENT)                            158

      BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie walks toward us on the sidewalk.
      We see him through a long lens. His image fractures. We see
      him in different planes of the image. He's beginning to
      break apart. One image. Two images.
                                                                       85.


159   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                   159

      QUICK FLASH. Little Candace is asleep on the floor.     Aunt
      Helen sits next to Little Charlie on the sofa.

                          AUNT HELEN
                Look, Charlie. She's fast asleep.

160   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING (PRESENT)                         160

      BACK TO PRESENT. We see Charlie fracturing. The pieces
      scattered. Out of focus. Lost. He's all over the frame.

161   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                   161

      QUICK FLASH.   Aunt Helen points to Little Candace.

                          AUNT HELEN
                Don't wake your sister.

162   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)                             162

      BACK TO PRESENT.   Charlie enters his house.

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

163   INT. AUNT HELEN'S CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                        163

      QUICK FLASH.   Aunt Helen gets hit by the semi-truck.

164   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                              164

      QUICK FLASH.   Little Charlie's mom opens the door to reveal a
      policeman.

165   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)                             165

      BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie is in the same entry hall in the
      same house 8 years later. Banging his head against the wall.
      "It's my fault. It's all my fault."

      He passes the photo wall on the stairs. We see the images of
      the family. Church. Communion. Baby pictures. Years of
      history staring at us. Ghosts on the wall.

166   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                           166

      BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie sits at his desk. We see him from
      behind. Perfectly still. Trying to keep himself calm.

                          CHARLIE
                Stop crying.
                                                                         86.


167   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY (FLASHBACK)                           167

      QUICK FLASH. Charlie thinks everyone is staring at him. His
      sister and her friends. His brother and mother. Mary
      Elizabeth and Alice. And worst of all... Sam and Patrick the
      night they toasted him. A paranoid nightmare.

168   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             168

      BACK TO PRESENT.   Charlie's falling to pieces.   The tears run
      down his face.

                          CHARLIE
                Stop crying.

169   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - VARIOUS TIMES (FANTASY)                   169

      QUICK FLASH. Derek hits Candace.   Patrick hits Brad.    The
      cafeteria erupts into violence.

      And Charlie remembers what he's blacked out.

      We see him in the cafeteria. Terrifying. He thinks he sees
      Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose. Hits another
      in the throat. And pushes another. Charlie looks at his
      hand, covered in blood. The whole school staring at him.

170   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             170

      BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie holds his head. Trying to stuff
      the pictures back in his brain. But he can't. They keep
      coming and coming, faster and faster. Sam's hand, Little
      Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt
      Helen is dead.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                It'll be our little secret.

      We go behind his head. The image moves closer and closer.
      Until it feels like we are inside Charlie's mind.

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

171   EXT. HOUSE SWIMMING POOL - DAY                                     171

      We see Candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friend's
      backyard pool. Her FRIEND (18, pretty) holds the cordless.

                          CANDACE'S FRIEND
                Candace... your brother's on the phone.

      Candace casually picks up the phone.
                                                                     87.


                               CANDACE
                   Hello.

                             CHARLIE (V.O.)
                   Hey, Candace.

                               CANDACE
                   Charlie?

                             CHARLIE
                   Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just
                   can't stop thinking something.

                               CANDACE
                   What?

                             CHARLIE
                   Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?
                   She died getting my birthday present, so
                   I guess I killed her, right? I've tried
                   to stop thinking that, but I can't. She
                   keeps driving away and dying over and
                   over.

      Candace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her
      brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone.

                             CANDACE
                   Call the police and send them to my
                   house.

                             CHARLIE
                   And I can't stop her.   I'm crazy again.

                             CANDACE
                   No, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad
                   are going to be home with Chris any
                   second.

                             CHARLIE
                   I was just thinking... what if I wanted
                   her to die, Candace?

                               CANDACE
                   What?    Charlie... Charlie!

      Dial tone.

172   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     172

      We begin in the house. It's silent. The hallway. The entry
      hall. The empty bedroom. Charlie's typewriter on his desk.
                                                                          88.

      It's all so quiet. And then, we see Charlie walking down the
      hallway. He turns the corner and enters the...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

173   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - DAY (PAST AND PRESENT)                     173

      Kitchen.   One room. Charlie doesn't know where he is
      anymore.   The past and present have bled together.

      QUICK FLASH. We see Little Charlie turn the corner into the
      kitchen. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie stands in
      the same kitchen, breathing shallow.

      QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie walks up to Aunt Helen
      sitting at the kitchen table. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old
      Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack.

      QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and
      turns it over... to reveal her wrist scars.

      BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie looks from the table to the
      counter with the bread and the KNIVES. He stares at the
      knives for a moment. Just as...

      The Policemen break down the door.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

174   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                          174

      We see Charlie's reflection in the window. The door opens
      slowly, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Burton, enters. She finds
      him sitting in the corner. He has been crying.

                            DR. BURTON
                 Charlie?   I'm Dr. Burton.

                           CHARLIE
                 Where am I?

                           DR. BURTON
                 Mayview hospital.

      This news hits Charlie hard.   He begins to panic.

                            CHARLIE
                 You have to let me go.    My dad can't
                 afford it.

                           DR. BURTON
                 Don't worry about that.
                                                               89.


                    CHARLIE
          No. I saw them when I was little. And I
          don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just
          tell me how to stop it.

                       DR. BURTON
          Stop what?

                    CHARLIE
          Seeing it. All their lives. All the
          time. Just... how do you stop seeing it?

                    DR. BURTON
          Seeing what, Charlie?

Charlie breaks.

                    CHARLIE
          There is so much pain.    And I don't know
          how to not notice it.

                    DR. BURTON
          What's hurting you?

                    CHARLIE
          No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone.
          It never stops. Do you understand?

Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic. Charlie nods, relieved that
someone finally understands. Until...

                    DR. BURTON
          What about your Aunt Helen?

Like cold water. What was tears is now confusion and soon to
be shame. Dr. Burton is gentle to him.

                    CHARLIE
          What about her?

                    DR. BURTON
          Can you see her?

                    CHARLIE
          Yes, she had a terrible life.   But... I
          mean, what am I...

                    DR. BURTON
          You said some things about her in your
          sleep.

                    CHARLIE
          I don't care.
                                                                        90.


                          DR. BURTON
                If you want to get better, you have to--

      Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.

                          CHARLIE
                She was... insane.

      The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He
      stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today.

                          DR. BURTON
                Charlie, are you going to let me help you
                here?

      Charlie cries and nods.

                          CHARLIE
                Okay.

                          DR. BURTON
                Do you remember anything before you
                blacked out?

                          CHARLIE
                I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house,
                and walking home...

      We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off.

175   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                      175

      The sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds
      outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks
      at Sam's typewriter. "Dear Friend" is already typed.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't
                go into detail about all of it. But I
                will say there were some very bad days.
                And some unexpected beautiful days.

      Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam.

176   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                       176

      Dr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                The worst day was the time my doctor told
                my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me.

      In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop.    Shocked.
                                                                     91.


177   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                       177

      Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway.

                          MOTHER
                Honey?

      His mother comes to hold him.

                          MOTHER (CONT'D)
                I'm so sorry.

      For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the
      sports page, before he chokes it down. He walks over to his
      son and kisses his forehead.

178   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   178

      Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                The best days were those when I could
                have visitors. My brother and sister
                always came for those until Chris had to
                go to training camp. He's going to be
                first string this year. And my sister
                told me she met a nice guy at her summer
                job.

179   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                              179

      Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand.    His
      mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton.

                          DR. BURTON
                There he is. So, I'll see you Thursday
                at 6, right?

      Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                My doctor said we can't choose where we
                can come from, but we can choose where we
                go from there. I know it's not all the
                answers, but it was enough to start
                putting these pieces together.

      Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital.

180   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT                             180

      The family sits at the dinner table.
                                                                    92.


                             FATHER
                   God bless this food that we are about to
                   receive. We thank You for this bounty in
                   the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

      After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is
      on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until...

                             CHARLIE
                   How do you think the Penguins are going
                   to do this year, dad?

                             FATHER
                   God damn Penguins. I think they're
                   allergic to God damn defense.

                             CHARLIE
                   What do the players call a puck again?

                                FATHER
                   A biscuit.

                             CANDACE
                   Are you sure it's not a "God damn
                   biscuit?"

                             FATHER
                   You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

      As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper. Candace
      talks about the books she'll need for college. Everyone
      starts eating. And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home.

181   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK                                   181

      Ding dong.    The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling.

                             PATRICK
                   Can Charlie come out and play?

      Charlie's mother smiles. Charlie smiles, too. Especially
      when he sees... Sam. Standing next to Patrick. Her hair a
      little different. Her eyes alive and happy.

182   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          182

      The gang of three sit at their booth. Sam and Patrick have
      their coffee. Charlie has his brownie. Like always.

                             SAM
                   That first night, I had grilled stickies.
                   It was so good. You have to visit in the
                   Fall. We'll have some. Okay?
                                                                      93.


                          CHARLIE
                Definitely.

                          PATRICK
                Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown
                scheduled for October.

      Charlie laughs.   Sam smiles.   After a beat...

                          SAM
                Well, can I tell you something? I've
                been away for two months. It's another
                world. And it gets better.
                    (off Charlie's smile)
                And my roommate Katie has the best taste
                in music.

      Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                I found the tunnel song.

      Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
                Let's drive.

183   EXT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                            183

      The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck.
      Patrick drives. Charlie in the middle. Sam the passenger.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I don't know if I will have the time to
                write any more letters because I might be
                too busy trying to participate. So, if
                this does end up being the last letter, I
                just want you to know that I was in a bad
                place before I started high school. And
                you helped me.

184   INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        184

      The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck.
      The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Even if you didn't know what I was
                talking about. Or know someone who's
                gone through it. It made me not feel
                alone.

      With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window
                                                                       94.


185   EXT. HIGHWAY 376 NORTH - NIGHT                                   185

      Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down,
      looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Because I know there are people who say
                all of these things don't happen. And
                there are people who forget what it's
                like to be 16 when they turn 17.

      We see Charlie in profile.   The night sky behind him until...

186   INT. FORT PITT TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    186

      ... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast
      they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at
      blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I know these will all be stories someday.
                And our pictures will become old
                photographs. And we'll all become
                somebody's mom or dad. But right now,
                these moments are not stories.

      Charlie turns to face forward. To the moment.   To Sam,
      smiling at him from the front seat.

                          CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D)
                This is happening. I am here. And I am
                looking at her. And she is so beautiful.

      Sam kisses Charlie. Then, she turns, and all three kids look
      ahead to everything in front of them. Charlie begins to
      stand in the back of the truck. Ready to leave the tunnel.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I can see it. This one moment when you
                know you're not a sad story. You are
                alive. And as you stand up and see the
                lights on buildings and everything that
                makes you wonder. And you are listening
                to that song on that drive with the
                people you love most in this world.

      Charlie stands in the back of the truck.   The wind on his
      face. He is free.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And in this moment, I swear...
                                                               95.


We see the moment as Charlie sees it. The tunnel's exit
getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city
behind it.

                    CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ... we are infinite.

The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies
out of the tunnel. Sam and Patrick scream with excitement.
Charlie holds his arms in the air. The weight of the world
gone. If only for a moment. This one moment. We see the
city. A million lights like white stars in a glass dome. We
crane to the sky. We are in Heaven.

                                                   FADE OUT.

                         ADA (VO - Scs 2 to 7)
               The voice you hear is not my 
               speaking voice, but my mind's 
               voice.

               I have not spoken since I was 
               six years old. No one knows 
               why, not even me. My father 
               says it is a dark talent and 
               the day I take it into my head 
               to stop breathing will be my 
               last.

               Today he married me to a man 
               I've not yet met. Soon my 
               daughter and I shall join him 
               in his own country. My husband 
               said my muteness does not 
               bother him. He writes and hark 
               this: God loves dumb creatures, 
               so why not he!

               Were good he had God's patience 
               for silence affects everyone in 
               the end. The strange thing is I 
               don't think myself silent, that 
               is, because of my piano. I 
               shall miss it on the journey.

Sc 2     EXT     SCOTTISH FIELD NEAR HOUSEDAY     Sc 2

A woman in a dark crepe Victorian dress sits leaning against a tree, 
her hands cover her face, around her neck she wears a writing pad. She 
crosses a field with large bare trees, in the far background stands a 
3 storey stone house.

Sc 3     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE CORRIDOR     DAY     Sc 3

A small girl roller skates down a dimly lit corridor. A parlour maid 
looks down the hall where the girl has disappeared.

Sc 4     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMDAY     Sc 4

Three men wearing long grey aprons are fitting the packing for a 
piano. On one of the men's arms is a tattoo of a whale in a wild sea.

Sc 5     EXT     SCOTTISH HOUSE GROUNDS     DAY     Sc 5

The girl wearing her skates sits on a small black pony. An old man is 
pulling it, but it won't move. (In the background, another aspect of 
the grey stone house.)

Sc 6     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE FLORA'S BEDROOM NIGHTSc 6

The woman lifts back the sheets from the bottom of the sleeping girl's 
bed. She is still wearing her skates. The woman cuts through the laces 
and removes the boots. One disembodied skate rolls across the room.

Sc 7     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMNIGHT     Sc 7

The woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears 
luminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, 
the objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands 
unconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves 
to a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she 
begins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved, 
unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie 
accompaniment to the music.

An old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing. 
The emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall.

Sc 8     EXT     UNDERWATER BEACH          DAY     Sc 8

Under water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the 
surface.

Sc 9     EXT     BEACH                    DAY     Sc 9

Amidst a riotous sea a woman, ADA, is carried to shore on the 
shoulders of five seamen. Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the 
men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her 
pad and pen. We should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial 
offering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited. A 
black sand backs on to an endless rise of dense native bush.

The breakers are chaotic, the men strain to keep their footing, 
calling to each other.

                         SEAMEN
               Hold still you smutt! Blast the 
               boat!
               Look up! Look up!
               Lay to! Lay to.
               Up with it you buggerers, hold 
               hard!
               Damn me won't you hold?!
               Etc.

Two of the men are black, all are battered, tattooed and tough, some 
are drunk.
Behind the woman is her daughter, a girl of ten in Scottish dress. She 
too is carried on the shoulders of seamen.

ADA is placed on the sand. She looks down at her feet sinking into the 
wet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of 
her. The sound of sea behind is thunderous.

Several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand.


Her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick. But ADA's attention 
is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a 
huge piano shaped box. They put it down as soon as they get to 5hore 
but ADA makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher 
safer ground. The piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it, 
one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free 
hand.

Sc 10     EXT     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 10

TWO SEAMEN finish carrying the last crate to shore. Trunks and boxes 
including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the 
shore.

The SEAMEN gather together. After a discussion in which they look 
between ADA and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the 
men approaches. Behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or 
down on the sand. They don't want to be involved. The sight of the 
women alone on this beach is too hopeless.

                         SEAMEN
               It's a little rough out there. 
               Could be they can't get through 
               to you in this weather. Maybe 
               they'll come over land.

ADA nods.

                         SEAMEN
               Have you things for shelter?

ADA nods.

                         SEAMEN
               What things have you?

ADA signs to her daughter. The little girl speaks clearly and loudly 
without emotion.

                         FLORA
               She says, "thank you".

Puzzled, the man walks off, then turns and comes back.

                         SEAMEN
               Does your mother prefer to come 
               on with us to Nelson?

ADA signs vigorously to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               She says, No. She says she'd 
               rather be boiled alive by 
               natives than get back in your 
               tub.

                         SEAMEN
               (stunned) You be damn fortuned 
               I don't smack your puppy gob, 
               missy. Damn lucky.

Sc 12     EXT     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 12

ADA is sheltering behind the crated piano, anxiety etched on her face.

FLORA  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has 
found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play 
a few notes. The sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to 
exaggerate their isolation and hopelessness.

2- See notes

Suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of 
the piano wetting her shoes. ADA stands, pushing FLORA onto her feet. 
She is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed.

They watch three of their boxes float out to sea. One of the hens has 
escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves.

SCENE 13 DELETED

Sc 14     EXT     BEACH                         DUSK     Sc 14

There is just a pink streak left in the sky. ADA and FLORA shelter 
inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges 
with stones.  Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation.

ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous 
and afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the "telling", her face is 
alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, 
while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is 
an odd shadow play.

                         FLORA
               (hand signaling) Mother... I'm 
               thinking

ADA pauses.

               (speaking) I'm not going to 
               call him Papa.  I'm not going 
               to call HIM anything. I'm not 
               even going to look at HIM.

Sc 15     EXT     BUSH ON WAY TO BEACH          DAY     Sc 15

Through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen MAORI people and two 
EUROPEAN MEN. The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such 
that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the 
MAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a 
mixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small 
and has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his 
cheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy 
and out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then 
slows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the 
green foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows.

                         BAINES
               Are we stopping?... Do you want 
               to stop?

The MAORI voices and laughter are becoming fainter. BAINES watches 
torn between his concern for STEWART and the split in their party.

3-See Notes

                         BAINES
               Shall we stop?

Unable to get an answer BAINES runs after the MAORIS.

                         BAINES
               Tai hoa! Me tatari tatou .., me 
               tutatou I konei.
               (Wait! We are stopping.. we're 
               stopping.)
                         SUBTITLED

STEWART takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through 
his wet hair. Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and 
over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us 
to see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he 
secretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on 
ahead possessed and determined.

                         STEWART
               We must get on.

The MAORIS look at BAINES bewildered.

                         TAME
               Aue tepatupsiarehe!
               (The fairy people, what can you 
               expect?)

Sc 16     EXT     BEACH                     MORNINGSc 16

It is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The 
party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to 
the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline 
where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of 
containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their 
arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART 
automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, 
where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a 
formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The 
party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its 
occupants.

                         STEWART
               Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart. 
               You'll have to wake yourself. 
               I've got men here to carry your 
               things.

ADA and FLORA struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of 
men and women. The MAORIS stare curiously and comment on the women.

               Aut he anahera enci?
               (Are they angels, they look 
               like angels.)
                         SUBTITLED

A man points at FLORA's feet and gestures as if holding one of the 
little shoes in his hand.

               Te monohi hoki! 
               (So small!) 
                    SUBTITLED

FLORA is struck by shyness and hides under her mother's skirt. ADA 
cannot look straight at STEWART and STEWART also cannot look at her.

                         STEWART
               I see you have a good many 
               boxes, I'd like to know what is 
               in each.

As ADA does not move STEWART is puzzled.

                         STEWART
               CAN - YOU - HEAR - ME?

ADA nods and looks up coldly, insulted by his slow loud speaking.

                         STEWART
               Well that is good, yes that is 
               good, good.

STEWART smiling searches ADA's face for some sign of comprehension but 
is unnerved by her lack of response. He stops smiling, and, patting 
his hair walks to the closest box. Several of the MAORI party follow 
behind STEWART while one of them closely and particularly mimics him.


                         STEWART
               What's in here?

ADA points to the writing already on the box saying "Crockery and 
Pots".

                         STEWART
               Ohh, yes so it is, written 
               there, crockery.

                         STEWART
               And this one?

ADA writes "bedclothes and linen" on the pad around her neck- While 
she writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her.

                         STEWART
               You're small. I never thought 
               you'd be small.

He walks to another chest

                         STEWART
               What's here?

She writes "clothes". The MAORI mimic also pretends to write.

Finally he comes to the piano box. He lifts a corner experimentally.

                         STEWART
               What's in here then, lead?

                         FLORA
               (gravely) It's my mother's 
               piano.

                         STEWART
               A piano?

The MAORIS touch the exposed legs of the piano.  STEWART speaks to the 
other European man BAINES.

                         STEWART
               Tell them to carry in pairs. 

               Those three and those two the 
               black and the red, then the 
               suitcases.

STEWART holds BAINES back a moment.

                         STEWART
               What do you think?

STEWART nods towards ADA. BAINES thinks a moment then turns towards 
ADA too.

                         BAINES
               She looks tired.

                         STEWART
               She's stunted, that's one 
               thing.

BAINES walks over to HONE a big man and the MAORJ leader, he stands 
tall with a great sense of his own importance. (Mana)

                         BAINES
               Anei nga pouaka - ko era e 
               toro.
               Me era e raa.
               (Here are the boxes, those 
               three and those two.) 
                    UNSUBTITLED

                         HONE
               E Hoal

HONE takes an aggressive fighting posture towards BAINES, insulted 
that BAINES should suggest he might carry anything. HONE does not 
carrying, he is the boss. With great dignity HONE retreats, too 
injured to help. Other MAORIS come up and BAINES assigns them boxes. 
ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone. She writes on her 
pad, "THE PIANO?" She shows STEWART.

                         STEWART
               Oh no, it can't come now.

                         FLORA
               It must come.

STEWART looks at FLORA

                         FLORA
               She wants it to come.

                         STEWART
               Yes and so do I, but there are 
               too few of us here to carry it. 
               TOO - HEAVY

ADA writes "I NEED THE PIANO." Her MAORI mimic copies her.

                         STEWART
               Do you mean you don't want your 
               kitchenware or your clothes? Is 
               that what you mean?

ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               We can't leave the piano

                         STEWART
               Let us not discuss this 
               further. I am very pleased....

STEWART slows down as he watches ADA again sign to FLORA, he has the 
uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted.

                         FLORA
               Mother wants to know if they 
               could come back directly for 
               it?

STEWART is shocked, his mouth hangs slightly open, paused in mid 
speech. TAHU mimics this mouth drop perfectly.

                         FLORA
               After they have taken the other 
               things?

STEWART is growing confused and anxious. His two mimics and their 
growing audience unnerve him further.

                         PITO
               Kei Riri a te raho Maroke. 
               (shouted loudly at TAHU)
               (Watch it dry balls is getting 
               touchy.)

                    SUBTITLED

STEWART nods suspiciously towards the MAORI speaker not understanding 
him, the speaker smiles and nods back.

                         STEWART
               I suggest you prepare for a 
               difficult journey. The bush 
               will tear clothes and the mud 
               is deep in places.


STEWART walks away. ADA stands beside the piano turned away from the 
activities. FLORA pats her hand trying to cheer her. Down on the beach 
a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking. Some of the young 
men are racing naked into the sea.

                         STEWART
               (to BAINES about the MAORIS) 
               What are they doing? We don't 
               have time for that.

Sc 17     EXI     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 17

It is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make 
their way up into the bush. ADA still stands beside her piano. FLORA 
wants to follow the party. BAINES comes back along the beach, trailed 
by a young Maori boy, KAHA.

                         BAINES
               Mr. Stewart asked if I might 
               show you to the path. (ADA does 
               not move) ... May I carry 
               something?

ADA turns to BAINES, her face angry and defiant, her eyes full of 
tears. BAINES falls back, struck by her show of emotion. ADA and FLORA 
walk past him toward the bush.

Sc 18     EXT     CLIFF ABOVE BEACH               DAY     Sc 18

The party threads its way through the bush along the cliff. ADA pauses 
at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand, tiny and 
desolate. Its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her. Its 
music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene.

Sc 19     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     Sc 19

Brown feet squelch through the mud, finally followed by dainty boots 
caked in dirt. The MAORI leaders of the party have stopped.

BAINES works his way to the front.

STEWART struggles up to the front to join BAINES, he speaks over the 
top of HONE.

                         STEWART
               What's he say?

                         BAINES
               Someone died here. It's tapu.

               But we came down this way 
               didn't we? I'm sure we did.

The MAORI leaders continue discussing.

STEWART continues over the top of the MAORI discussion.

                         STEWART
               They want more money. They are 
               trying to make two days out of 
               it?

                         BAINES
               No, no they know another track 
               - to the side of this.

ADA and FLORA sit watching, out of breath. The bush is dense, 
claustrophobic and exotic. One of the MAORI women sits close to ADA 
apparently not looking at her- Slowly she draws the scarf that is in 
ADA's lap into her own. Defiantly she puts it on.

Meanwhile another woman makes a very dignified attempt to wipe the 
freckles from FLORA's face.

It is another day and STEWART'S hut, bleakly set amidst smoking stumps 
is full of squeals, chasing and antics.

Sc 21     INT     STEWART'S HUT               DAY     Sc 21

The reverend in frock coat has a wedding dress stuck part way up his 
arms. It is not a normal wedding dress but a backless one used again 
and again as a photographic prop. Stewart's AUNT MORAG and her 
companion NESSIE are trying to pull it off.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Watch your feet!

                         NESSIE
               Watch your feet!

ADA and FLORA find the family fun frightening and have taken refuge in 
the bedroom.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Careful! Watch his hand.

                         NESSIE
               Watch his hand

The REVEREND tickles his sister as she tries to get the sleeve off his 
hand. NESSIE squeals with excitement.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Stop it!

NESSIE looks towards ADA panting with excitement at the fun.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (shooing the Reverend out) 
               We'll bring out the bride.

The two women now fit the wedding dress on ADA.

                         AUNT MORAG
               LIFT - YOUR - ARM - UP - DEAR.

FLORA sits on the bed sulkily. She leans back and crosses her leg.

                         FLORA
               My REAL father was a famous 
               German composer

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohh the tag is broken.

                         FLORA
               (continues) .... They met when 
               my mother was an opera 
               singer... in Luxemburg...

The two women pause to look at FLORA. ADA signs to FLORA "THAT'S 
ENOUGH!"

                         FLORA
               Why?

ADA looks away, the two women finish primping the dress. FLORA crosses 
her arms.

                         FLORA
               I want to be in the photograph.

Sc 22     EXT     STEWART'S Hut                DAY     Sc 22

NESSIE half holds an umbrella over ADA as they make their way to where 
the camera is setup in front of a chair and a sparse display of three 
toi-toi. All about the house is muddy, so much so that they must weave 
their way through on planks and logs. A fine veil of rain is falling 
across the distant bush, the whole valley is shrouded in mist. STEWART 
looks through the camera at the REVEREND and the photographer who are 
posing as the couple, complete with tatty bouquet. STEWART notices 
ADA's arrival and seeing her as a real bride, his bride, he is 
struckdumb with pride, even the rough tapes at the back or the dress 
cannot destroy the illusion.

                         STEWART
               Beautiful.

The umbrellas are held away, the rain pours down.

Sc 23     INT/EXT     STEWARTS HUT BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 23

AUNT MORAG has brought a chair into the bedroom and sits knee to knee 
with FLORA.

                         AUNT MORAG
               I thought she met your father 
               in Luxemburg.

                         FLORA
               Well, yes, in Austria where be 
               conducted the Royal Orchestra. 

                         AUNT MORAG
               (frowning) And where did they 
               get married?

AUNT MORAG checks to see if someone is coming.

                         FLORA
               (her Scottish accent becomes 
               thick and expressive) In an 
               enormous forest, with real 
               fairies as bridesmaids each 
               holding a little elf's hand.

AUNT MORAG sits back, regarding FLORA with obvious disapproval and 
disappointment. She smooths back her hair.

                         FLORA
               No, I tell a lie, it was in a 
               small country church, near the 
               mountains

AUNT MORAG is becoming involved again. She leans forward.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Which mountains are those dear?

                         FLORA
               The Alps.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohhh I've never been there. 
               (she leans forward)

                         FLORA
               Mother used to sing the songs 
               in German and her voice would 
               echo across the valleys

               That was before the 
               accident....

                         AUNT MORAG
               Oh what happened?

MORAG looks over her shoulder as FLORA continues to talk, so 
persuasive is FLORA's storytelling that the scene comes vividly to 
life, albeit in FLORA's dark pupil.

                         FLORA
               One day when my mother and 
               father were singing together in 
               the forest, a great storm blew 
               up out of nowhere. But so 
               passionate was their singing 
               that they did not notice, nor 
               did they stop as the rain began 
               to fall and when their voices 
               rose for the final bars of the 
               duet a great bolt of lightening 
               came out of the sky and struck 
               my father so that he lit up 
               like a torch... And at the same 
               moment my father was struck 
               dead my mother was struck dumb! 
               She- never-spoke-another-word.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohhh ... dear. Not another word    
               From the shock, yes it would 
               be.

The story is interrupted by the return of the wedding party who are 
dripping wet, exactly as the couple in the story. AUNT MORAG bustles 
over to take off the wet wedding gown, her face puckered with tragedy.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Terrible.  Terrible

Before she can undo the ties ADA pulls it from herself so aggressively 
that the ties and part of the gown comes apart. None of this is a 
concern to ADA who is distracted with fear for her piano. She crosses 
to the little window and stares anxiously at the falling rain.

Soft piano music has been playing over the previous scene. Now it 
builds to strength as sea water swirls high around the piano, small 
and embattled on the dark rainy beach.

Sc 23     INT     STEWART'S HUT BEDROOM          DAY     Sc 25

It's morning of the next day. ADA and FLORA sit amongst tea chests in 
the bedroom. ADA is signing intently to FLORA. FLORA signs back, 
sometimes using words. STEWART watches uneasy with their secret 
communication. As STEWART enters the animation is suspended. ADA 
stands and takes a step back as if to attention.

                         STEWART
               I shall be gone for some days. 
               There is some Maori land I want 
               and may buy very reasonably. 
               (STEWART shuffles) I am hoping 
               you will use the time to settle 
               in, and, in some ways we may 
               start again

FLORA and ADA look at each other.

                         STEWART
               All right?

ADA looks at him blankly, then nods.

ADA and FLORA dressed in cloaks and bonnets skirt the dense bush 
trying to find a path in. It is not easy, because the bush is so 
tight. ADA's leg slides in up to her calf in mud.

Sc 27     EXT     BAINES'                    DAY     Sc 27

ADA and FLORA arrive at BAINES' rough hut. It is mid-morning but 
BAINES is not yet dressed. ADA hands him a note. BAINES looks at it 
blankly.

                         BAINES
               I'm not able to read.

ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               Please take us to the beach 
               where we landed.

                         BAINES
               I'm sorry, I can't do that. 
               (FLORA and ADA stare evenly at 
               him) 
               I don't have the time.
               (They continue to stare.)
               Goodbye

It is much later when BAINES emerges from his hut with a saddle over 
his arm. The two women are still there. ADA looks up at him 
expectantly.

FLORA mirrors her expression.

                         BAINES
               I - can't - take - you there. I 
               can't do it.

He puts the saddle over a rail. He continues to saddle up, sneaking 
glances at them from under the horse and around its side. They watch 
him closely, not pleadingly, but stubbornly1 eerily of one mind.

The sky is blue with long wisps of cloud.

The party of three break onto the long expanse of beach where the 
piano still stands. It has not been without visitors. There are 
footprints on the sand and some of the boards have been pulled back. 
ADA passes BAINES, walking urgently towards it. Soon, ADA has removed 
enough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys. EMNES stays 
back. ADA takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys 
again. Her whole composition is altered. She is animated, joyful, 
excited.

Down on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention 
using a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the 
sand.

BAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the 
spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His 
attention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he 
watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer.

The shadows are long on the sand when BAIN'ES collects the boards. ADA 
and FLORA are attempting a duet. ADA notices him come towards them 
with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood 
darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has 
stopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape 
and bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her 
mesmerised as he replaces the boards.

The hut puffs smoke out into the valley. The lie of the land traps 
sound like a shell and the clear high notes of a voice echo out. 
Suspicious that ADA is singing, STEWART approaches the house quietly. 
Through the open kitchen door he sees that the keys of a piano have 
been etched on the table top. While ADA "plays" the notes FLORA sings 
them.

STEWART puts his pack down. ADA stands to attention, folding the 
tablecloth back over the table.

                         STEWART

               Hello.


ADA nods. STEWART'S hand explores the markings on the table. ADA 
watches his hand moving under the checked cloth.

Sc 34     INT     MISSION HOUSE               DAY     Sc 34

AUNT MORAG, NESSIE and TWO MAORI GIRLS dressed in proper Victorian 
costume are kneeling around a huge double white sheet, sewing and 
cutting it. The MAORI girls are part of the mission's good works. They 
are dressed in European style and while their training is in polite 
proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their 
demonstrative displays of affection, and their clay tobacco pipes to 
which they are addicted.

STEWART is standing, looking on. BAINES is behind him in the kitchen 
removing his boots.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (looking carefully at STEWART) 
               Well you stopped combing your 
               hair, which is a good thing, it 
               was looking over done. 
               (without pause but referring to 
               the sheet) You see these are 
               the slits that the heads will 
               go through, show him Nessie ... 
               they'll be dead, the Reverend 
               is going to use animal blood, 
               no doubt it will be very 
               dramatic. Tea! 
               (for NESSIE rather than to her)

                         NESSIE
               It will be very dramatic.


NESSIE leaves to get the tea. HENI, the MAORI girl with a Moku tickles 
MARI'S back while she sews.

They sing the anthem in snatches. It is background to the 
conversation.

                         STEWART
               (sitting down) 
               What would you think if someone 
               played a kitchen table like it 
               were a piano?

                         AUNT MORAG
               Like it were a piano?

                         STEWART
               It's strange isn't it? I mean 
               it's not a piano, it doesn't 
               make any sound.

NESSIB puts STEWART'S tea down. BAINES comes in with his tea cup 
dwarfed in his big hands. He stands back leaning against a wall.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (hissing to NESSIE) Biscuits.' 
               No, no sound.

NESSIE hustles back to the kitchen.

                         STEWART
               I knew she was mute, but now 
               I'm thinking it's more than 
               that. I'm wondering if she's 
               not brain affected.

                         AUNT MORAG
               No sound at all?

                         STEWART
               No, it was a table.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (musing) Well, she was very 
               violent with the gown. She tore 
               off a chunk of lace. if hadn't 
               been there I'd have sworn she'd 
               used her teeth

                         NESSIE
               and wiped her feet an it.

                         STEWART
               Well it has not yet come to 
               anything. Just a concern.

AUNT MORAG pats her chest. a calming device.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Oh, yes, yes of course, a 
               concern.

                         STEWART
               There is something to be said 
               for silence

                         AUNT MORAG
               Oh indeed. Cotton'.

She holds her needle up for NESSIE to thread.

                         STEWART
               (warming)  And with time she 
               will, I'm sure, become 
               affectionate.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Certainly, there is nothing so 
               easy to like as a pet and they 
               are quite silent.

BAINES watches quietly on.

Sc 35     EXT     STEWART'S WOODCHOP          DAY     Sc 35

STEWART is at the woodshop cutting firewood. He displays his 
virtuosity as an axeman, cutting the wood into ever more slender 
pieces, FLORA is watching and stacking the fallen timber. She flinches 
as the axe hits the wood, but scurries in to pick up the timber. 
BAINES is standing talking to STEWART.

                         BAINES
               Those 80 acres, that cross the 
               stream, what do you think of 
               them?

                         STEWART
               On your property?

                         BAINES
               Yes

BAINES carries a log across for STEWART who talks without pausing in 
his work,

                         STEWART
               Good, flatish land with 
               reliable water, why? I don't 
               have money. What are you about?

                         BAINES
               I'd like to make a swap.

                         STEWART
               What for?

                         BAINES
               The piano.

                         STEWART
               The piano on the beach? Ada's 
               piano?

BAINES nods. STEWART stops, this is serious.

                         STEWART
               It's not marshy is it?

STEWART has walked a few paces away from his wood chop in the 
direction of the land.

                         BAINES
               No.


                         STEWART
               You'd have to organise it up 
               here.

                         BAINES
               Yes, I thought that.

                         STEWART
               Well Baines the music lover, I 
               never would have known. Hidden 
               talents George.

                         BAINES
               I'll have to get lessons. It 
               wouldn't be much use without 
               them.

                         STEWART
               Yes, I suppose you would.

BAINES remains silent. He looks away.

                         STEWART
               Well Ada can play.

BAINES shrugs.

                         STEWART
               I have it in a letter she plays 
               well. She's been playing since 
               she was 5 or6.

FLORA has stopped stacking. She is lying along the top of the wood, 
lifting a leg up and down, watching the men.

STEWART, flushed with his plans, is pouring tea into cups. FLORA peers 
at cup level through the steam. ADA sits beside her at the table.

                         STEWART
               I have got us some excellent 
               land. Baines has taken some 
               queer idea to have a piano, and 
               you are to give him lessons. 
               Have you taught before?

ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               What on?

                         STEWART
               On your piano, that is the 
               swap.

ALA finger signs, her face furious.

                         STEWART
               What does she say?

                         FLORA
               She says it's her piano, and 
               she won't have him touch it. 
               He's an oaf, he can't read, 
               he's ignorant.

                         STEWART
               He wants to improve himself... 
               and you will be able to play on 
               it ... (ADA is not responding 
               well) Teach him to look after 
               it.

ADA's breathing becomes heavy with anger, she writes Curiously on her 
pad.

               NO! NO! THE PIANO IS MINE! IT'S 
               MINE!

STEWART regards her note and her passion with suspicion and disdain

                         STEWART
               (getting up) You can't go on 
               like this, we are a family now, 
               all of us make sacrifices and 
               so will you.
               You will teach him. I shall see 
               to that!

ADA's emotions are suddenly removed and she views STEWART blankly, 
eerily so.

Sc 37     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     SC 37

The piano is taken up through the bush by a group of six to eight 
MAORI MEN. It's very heavy and awkward and they grunt and struggle 
with it.

               You lick it.)

Someone stumbles and the back of the piano comes crashing to the 
ground thundering out in the bottom end of the scale. People scatter. 
Only one stays who warrior like challenges the piano.

The women duck low to avoid a branch as STEWART leads them to BAINE'S

strange, bearded forest where the tops of trees are bare and ghost 
like.

               I'd try children's tunes, 
               nothing more complicated

ADA is unrepentant, she does not want to teach BAINES the piano.

                         STEWART
               Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good.

               good, very nice looking thing. 
               Well . I wish you luck. The girls 
               are very excited about the 
               lessons.

The "girls" look anything but excited. FLORA shy, plays obsessively 
with a long strand of greasy hair. ADA is cold and grim.

                         STEWART
               Flora will explain anything Ada says.
               They talk through their fingers, 
               you can't believe what they say 
               with just their hands.

STEWART leaves. BAJNES goes to the piano and lifts the lid. He looks 
at them. ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               My mother wants to see your 
               hands. Hold them out.

BAINES holds out his hands, spread wide as if holding a ball.

               No, no, like this

FLORA puts her neat little fingers together, first with their backs up 
then she turns them over. HAINES does the same only his bands are big 
and coarse. ADA signs to FLORA. BAINES is shyly keen.

                         FLORA
               You have to wash them.

                         BAINES

ADA signs.

               The marks do not come out.  
               They are scars and hardened 
               skin.

ADA and FLORA do not move. Humiliated BAINES takes a scrub brush, soap 
and bucket and goes outside. ADA can see him from the window. She 
moves to her piano. She wants to touch it but she is torn by her 
feelings, wanting it, but not owning it. She strokes the varnished 
wood with her hand and softly lifts the lid. Outside FLORA stands 
beside BAINES pointing out hits of his hand he should still scrub. 
Furtively she lays her hands on the keys. The instrument is horribly 
out of tune, almost every note is off. She goes outside and signs to 
FLORA.

                         FLORA
               There's no tune left in the 
               piano so she can't teach you.

with the debris of many meals. He sits up feeling about for his

               Ah, a Broadbent. A fine

               200. Yes, they like their 
               pianos there.

Out of his pocket he takes a carefully wrapped tuning fork. He unwraps 
the package, lifts the back and lid and starts to tune. He sniffs the 
air. BAINES watches, He sniffs close to the keys.

               Scent? And salt of course.

He works on.

               What will you play when it's 
               tuned? What music do you play?

BAINS looks over at him from the meal he is preparing.

venture.

               I hope you've scrubbed your 
               hands.

FLORA begins a scale.

               Oh, it's in tune.

She looks over at BAINES who is still gazing out the window.

                         FLORA
               What's out there?

She gets up to see what BAINES is looking at. She sees her mother and 
divines BAINES is looking at nothing.

                         FLORA
               You have to watch me where I 
               put my fingers.

FLORA starts again. ADA can only hear the piano faintly but moves 
closer as she too hears it's in tune.

As she enters the hut BAINES pulls his fingers away from the piano. 
FLORA sees this and stops too. She looks at her mother.

                         FLORA
               It's in tune.

ADA checks the other notes. FLORA stands with her arms folded, a bit 
sulky and fluffed up.

                         FLORA
               (Hissing) I was teaching.

ADA tries the piano. She looks over at BAINES then signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               She wants to see what you can 
               do.

                         BAINES
               I'd rather not play. I want to 
               listen and learn that way.

                         FLORA
               Everyone has to practice.

                         BAINES
               I just want to listen.

ADA is a bit nonplussed. She does not want to be listened to anymore 
than she wants to teach. She pulls a strand of her hair then signs to 
FLORA.

                         FLORA
               What do you want to hear?

BAIWES shrugs shyly and locks away out the window. He doesn't know

                         BAINES
               Anything.

ADA is slow to start. Unobliging as ever she plays scales. But once 
begun her belligerence fades as her absorption in the music 
strengthens.


Sc 49     INT     STEWART'S HUT/ADA'S BEDROOM      NIGHT     Sc 49 

Back at STEWART'S hut, ADA lies dispirited on the bed. FLORA lies 
beside her holding ADA's hand.

                         FLORA
               Tell me about my real father.

ADA nods and strokes FLORA's hair from her face. FLORA leans back.

               How did you speak to him?

ADA signs to FLORA who watches in love with all the stories of her 
mother and unreal father.

                         ADA (subtitled)
               I didn't need to speak, I could 
               lay thoughts out in his mind 
               like they were a sheet

                         FLORA
               What happened? Why didn't you 
               get married?

ADA continues to sign her hands casting odd animal like shadows on the 
newspapered walls.

                         ADA cont.
               After a while he became 
               frightened and he stopped 
               listening.


STEWART enters their bedroom. FLORA stops and ADA stands against the 
wall. STEWART finds the atmosphere curious yet impenetrate.

                         STEWART
               Shall I kiss you goodnight?

FLORA looks up at her mother. ADA shrugs.

STEWART nods stiffly, and uncomfortably, he leaves.

It's raining heavily, FLORA sits on the small verandah outside BAINES' 
hut, her legs stuck straight out into the wet. She is overseeing a 
merciless power game with the dog, forcing it out of the verandah with 
a stick.

Sc 51     INT     BAINE'S HUT                    DAY     Sc 51

ADA's playing can be heard inside. BAINES sits back watching ADA. Her 
cape on the hook is dripping a puddle on to the floor and there is a 
circle of drips around her skirt hem. She is totally absorbed in her 
piano music as she was on the beach.

BAINES watches. Her long white neck, now wet from rain, proves 
irresistible. He comes across the room and kisses her. ADA jumps up 
and prepares to leave. BAINES stands in front of the door.

                         BAINES
               Do you know how to bargain, nod 
               if you do.

She doesn't move,

               There's a way you can have your 
               piano back. Do you want it 
               back? You want it back?

ADA eyes him suspiciously.

                         BAINES
               You see I'd like us to make a 
               deal. There's things I want to 
               do while you stay. If you let 
               me you can earn it back.

               What do you think, one visit 
               for every key.

ADA is tense but she is thinking about it. She holds up a finger then 
points to the black of her dress.

                         BAINES
               Your dress?

ADA shakes her head.

               Skirt ...?

She walks over to her piano and points to a black key. 

               For every black one?

ADA turns raising her head, nodding. 

               That's a lot less, half.

BAINES is counting the keys. ADA starts for the front door. 

               All right, all right then, the 
               black keys.

She sits back at the piano. She plays the lowest black key as in 
number one

She takes her hands off the piano waiting.

               It's better that you play.

Obediently she begins, stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches 
her neck.

                         BAINES
               Play... Keep playing.

After a moment she settles back to the piano.

Sc 53     EXT     RIVERHOLE NEAR BAINES'          DAY     Sc 53

BAINES bathes in a riverhole. He is watched by a gathering of Maori, 
sometimes with great seriousness, at other times with hilarity. They 
pass between them his clothes, trying them on and mimicking him. One 
of the older women HIRA crouches close to the bank keeping up a steady 
line of inquiry. Her manner is relaxed but focused and persistent. She 
smokes a pipe-

                         HIRA
               I got the good wife for you 
               Peini. She pray good. Clean.

BAINES continues good humouredly washing.

               Why? We need you pakeha clever.

               where she?

                         BAINES
               She lives her own life in New 
               Jersey, America.

                         HIRA

               You get rnana for that. Our 
               chief four wives.

BAINES shakes his head amusedly. As he gets out of the river HIRA 
slaps him.

               I marry white man Peini, he a 
               whaler like you. He very good 
               to me. Love me, nurse me.

HIRA touches her own face where BAINES' tattoo is.

               Who do that? It not finish, 
               that no good Peini. You finish!

Several people on the bank are taking turns to comb their hair, 
peering into a tiny piece of mirror.

BAINES' dog hears ADA and FLORA approach. It takes off under the 
house. FLORA calls the dog. It keeps well hidden. ADA has gone on 
inside and the door is closed. FLORA stands outside the door left out 
and lonely. She knocks. BAINES answers.

                         FLORA
               (small voice) 
               I want to speak to my mother

She buries her head in her mother's skirt.

               I don't want to be outside, I 
               want to watch. 

ADA signs to FLORA.

               I'll be very quiet.

ADA leads her to the door signing to her

               I won't look at him!

FLORA is shut out.

ADA sits at the piano. She is shy and nervous She turns to BAINES who 
nods. ADA begins to play. BAINIES keeps his head bowed, but as the 
playing becomes more confident he raises his head to watch.  He sits 
at a far corner of the room apparently enjoying the whole vision or 
this woman at her piano.

After some time BAINES, affected by the music, takes his chair to a 
closer position and from an opposite angle. ADA glances up as she 
feels him passing behind her.  He seems satisfied to watch. His 
attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to 
the piano.

Again he shifts his chair, taking it round the back and to the other 
side of the piano. As he moves ADA watches warily. From this position 
be doesn't try to touch her, but watches, enjoying her fingers moving 
on the keys and the small details of motion on her face. Twice he 
closes his eyes and breathes deeply BAINES is experiencing an 
unpractised sense of appreciation and lust. When his eyes are closed, 
ADA glances at him with curiosity and suspicion.

FLORA stands on a kitchen chair. AUNT MORAG and NESSIE have paused 
from fitting FLORA's bodice and wire angel wings. They are attempting 
to learn the hand gestures as FLORA signs:

               "I shall listen hard to rehearsal, 
               because I live too 
               far away to go often."

                         AUNT MORAG
               (suspiciously) Which sign is 
               the word rehearsal?

FLORA deftly demonstrates.

                         AUNT MORAG
               I can't imagine a fate worse 
               than being dumb. Turn around.

               Actually, to tell you the whole 
               truth, Mama says most people 
               speak rubbish and it's not 
               worth the listen.

AUNT MORAG and NESSIE exchange looks.

               (stiffly) Well, that is a 
               strong opinion.

ADA is quick to remove a used plate and cup left on top of the piano.

BAINES is sitting next to the window, his elbow on the sill, his head 
turned away.

                         BAINES
               Lift your skirt,

ADA stops playing. She turns to him. Thinks about it then slowly lifts 
her skirt a little to show her boots.

               Lift it higher.

ADA pulls the skirt up fractionally so the top other boots are 
exposed.

BAINIES nods ADA starts to play again, not so confidently as before.

BAINES moves close, he goes down on his knees to watch her feet on the 
pedals.

                         BAINES
               Higher.

ADA doesn't hear.

               Lift it higher.

She stops and lifts her skirt to her knees. She looks at BAINES with 
ill-disguised contempt. BAINES is enthralled with her legs, or what he 
can now see of them. He moves back to watch them from behind. He's 
lying on the ground, head propped on his arm. ADA's slim stockinged 
calves work the pedals, one of the stockings has a small hole through 
which her white skins shows

NESSIE as he cuts out the shape of an axe from a piece of marbled 
cardboard. A lamplight flickers warm tones across their faces while 
the rest of the room is dark giving it a conspiratorial air.

The REVEREND points to the opposite rose-papered wall, where his 
shadow and paper axe now look very real as they loom large above the 
crouching NESSIE chopping into her. NESSIE squeals, as does MARY.

denoting lesson four.

               Undo your dress. This part, 
               (he indicates the top) I want 
               to see your arms.

ADA is taken unawares. She sits a moment unsure if she wants to 
cooperate, then slowly she staffs to undo her buttons.

ADA pulls her arms out of the tight sleeves. Underneath she wears a 
worn-in bodice. Her arms are so white they seem transparent. A 
delicate network of blue-green veins crisscross up the soft underpart 
of her arms. A dark growth of hair in her armpit suggests a shadowy 
depth. The back of her hands, normally white, are quite tanned in 
comparison.

                         BAINES
               Play.

BAINES draws his chair close. Gently he places his hand on the soft 
underpart of her forearm. ADA stiffens and pulls away. He grips the 
arm.

               Two keys.

ADA continues to play. Slowly he moves his hand higher towards her 
shoulder. Clearly unnerved she changes the music to something brisk, 
almost comical. BAINES feels suddenly ridiculous, his mood broken. He 
takes his hand away and moves back to the window injured. ADA is 
victorious, she is pleased to have won herself a respite.

way through the fallen logs to BAINES path.

                         STEWART
               Wait.

The two women stop. There is a Japanese sense of deferment to STEWART

                         STEWART

               That is good, yes.

As ADA walks on AUNT MORAG leans towards STEWART.

               She seems quieted down.  Is she 
               more affectionate?

STEWART looks after them unable to answer.

BAINES secures a chair against the door while ADA is removing her 
dress top. She sits at the piano hugging herself against the chill.  
As BAINES passes be knocks the jacket off the chair back. He picks it 
up and takes it across to her seat by the window.

BAINES nods and ADA begins to play. BAINES fingers the still warm 
jacket1 he lifts it up and smells it. ADA turns around and stops 
playing suddenly appalled by his odd sensual pleasure taking. She 
holds out her hand for the jacket, her expression stern and 
censorious. She indicates he should return it to the chair back. 
BAINES ignores her. ADA stands and comes over to BAINES. She pulls the 
jacket from his hands and replaces it across the chair back, but as 
she turns to sit,

BAINES is beside her. He pulls the shoulders of her bodice down, 
exposing her shoulders and some of her breast. ADA immediately stands, 
but BMNES is much stronger and man-handles her across to the bed. ADA 
struggles seriously, this is much, much more than she was expecting.

                         BAINES
               Ada, four keys.

ADA holds up five fingers and mouths 'five'.

               I just want to lie.

ADA shakes her head vigorously and again mouths five'. 

               All right, all right five.

ADA no longer struggles. She is stiff and still. BAINES intoxicated by 
the smell and presence of her skin becomes soft and gentle. He kisses 
and touches her with feeling and affection. Then suddenly aware of her 
stillness he too becomes still. He pulls himself up to see whether her 
face betrays her feelings. ADA seizes this opportunity to return to 
the uncertain sanctuary of her piano. From the bed, BAINES watches her 
run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture 
betraying affection never afforded to him. BAINES gets up. He shuts 
the piano lid forcing ADA to remove her hand.

ADA immediately stands and dresses, marking hurtfully BAINES' 
ownership of her piano.

STEWART comes in to put on his jacket, but the collar is all tucked 
in. ADA automatically adjusts it for him, settling it around his neck. 
Her touch, meant practically, strangely affects him. In an impassioned 
impasse, meant gallantly, he tries to kiss ADA's finger tips. The 
gesture falters as ADA, surprised, jumps back.

Some people are already seated in the hall. Several other angels have 
arrived, and they like FLORA are ushered backstage.

Sc 67     INT     SCHOOL HALL BACKSTAGE          NIGHT     Sc 67
BACKSTAGE, the Sunday School teacher is gathering the children 
together, reminding them of the order of songs, checking their hair, 
etc. The local dramatic society are also preparing themselves. One of 
the women is peeping through a hole in a make-shift curtain to watch 
the townspeople seating themselves.

                         WOMAN
               They're bringing in extra 
               seats!

Despite this, there would still be only a maximum of forty people. 10 
or so of them MAORIS in their best European dress.

                         ANOTHER WOMAN
               Oh God, don't pin my hair too 
               high Alfred!

                         STILL ANOTHER
               Yes, me too, do it about here 
               ... (she shows Alfred)

Two of the women are putting a little c4ouring on each of the angels 
while two other angels are being smacked for putting their white gloved 
hands in the bucket of blood.

Sc 68     INT     SCHOOL HALL                    NIGHT     Sc 68

Everyone is chatting at each other's seats, except the MAOIRI guests 
who wait solemnly. AUNT MORAG is organising the placement of the new 
seats. BAINES arrives.

                         MAN ONE
               Look who's here, the musical MR BAINES
               What will we have tonight 
               George, "Twinkle, twinkle?"

BAINES smiles and blinks, the teasing continues as BAINES scans the 
room for ADA. Two of the MAORI PARTY share one pair of shoes so that 
only one may be in the hall at a time, while the other waits 
barefooted outside.

                         ANOTHER MAN
               'Mary had a little lamb' or a 
               polka, come on George what's it 
               to be?

AUNT MORAG hustles over to BAINIES and pushes him in front of her 
towards NESSIE and the piano.


                         AUNT MORAG
               Mr. Baines, do come and turn 
               pages

BAINES looks wildly about for rescue.

                         BAINES
               I can't read music, I have just 
               begun.

BAINES backs off from NESSIE whose face drops in disappointment. He 
has spotted ADA and is eager to take a seat near her. He takes the 
seat next to ADA but one. He sits smiling and blinking. The teasing 
continues, behind him.

                         STEWART
               (turning) Lot of fools. Come 
               on, move up.

ADA puts her hand on the seat and shakes her head indicating that she 
is saving it for FLORA. BAINES is rebuffed and looks across at ADA who 
ignores him.

The main lights are put out and everyone returns to their places. In 
the dark STEWART shyly takes ADA's hand in his. BAINES watches STEWART 
squeezing her hand and quite out of control stands and leaves 
accompanied by a chorus of eshhhhhhhhhhhhhn. Satisfied, ADA watches 
him go.

The children file on with their candles, They stand in a group singing 
with great seriousness, but struck with shyness their voices are so 
small as barely to be heard.

               -sing up Billy!
               -Come on sing out!

One of the smallest promptly pees. An arm reaches under the curtain to 
wipe the stage.

Sc 69     INT     SCHOOL RALL & BACK STAGE     NIGHT     Sc 69

Backstage all is ready for the main dramatic event. There seems to be 
more peep-holes than curtains as eyes press themselves to the little 
flap. The master of ceremonies, the REVEREND is on stage explaining 
the dramatics. He is wearing harlequin tights and rompers, his face is 
dramatically paled. The candles are blown out.

                         REVEREND
               And so the young maid came upon 
               each and all of Bluebeard's 
               missing wives, their severed 
               heads still bleeding, their 
               eyes still crying.

The piano accompaniment is suspenseful while the audience shriek 
appreciatively. Backstage AUNT MORAG provides the dripping blood, 
moving between the corpses, she peers at the audience through a peep-
hole in the curtain.

                         REVEREND
               But who it this? 

(AUNT MORAG looks around gasping, fooled despite herself)

A loud improvised door slam and heavy footsteps. NESSIE, in costume, 
freezes. The shadow of Bluebeard moves clumsily down the cut-out 
banister and along the corridor.

                         BLUEBEARD
               I am home early my sweet wife 
               ... where art thou?

The girl scrambles for the fallen key and rushes out of the closet 
into the silhouette corridor.

                         YOUNG WIFE
               Hello husband, what a surprise!

                         BLUEBEARD
               Yes wife, a surprise indeed! So 
               now you know my secret you, the 
               sweetest and youngest or all my 
               wives must be prepared to die.

BLUEBEARD pulls out a cut-out axe and moves towards her.

Two of the young warriors in CHIEF NIHE's party rise to their feet.

               Auc! Ha aba ra tenei?

                    SUBTITLED

NIHE waves them down, but they are shaken up and only crouch above 
their seats. The others stare anxiously between NIHE and the stage.

                         NIHE
               (Amused by them)
               E te whsnau keite pai-he takaro

               just a game)

BLUEBEARD moves closer, the young wife drops to her knees her hands 
held up in prayer.

                         YOUNG WIFE
               No, no wait!

                         BLUEBEARD
               I shall not wait. Bare your 
               neck.

As BLUEBEARD raises his axe again, first one then the other of the 
young warriors run forward, shouting a fierce war cry and parting the 
audience, who flee to either side while the corpses come very much to 
life.

               Kia hiwara! Kin hiwara! 
               (Be on the alert! Brace 
               yourself)

Only NIHE and his top-hatted daughter remain calmly in their seats. 
The warriors have BLUEBEARD cornered and whimpering an umbrella held 
spear-like above him. NIHE stomps his stick, his great voice booming 
out.

the blood-bucket, the paper axe, the splits in the sheets.

Sc 71     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 71

ADA goes to the piano, she is upset that BAINES has again left a plate 
on top of it. BAINES intercepts her, stepping several times between 
her and the piano. She sees the game and stands still. He steps aside. 
She removes the plate, gently, lovingly wiping the surface underneath. 
There is a sulky irritation in the ways BAINES watches her.

                         BAINES
               I have been waiting. You are 
               very late.

ADA starts to play, BAINES watches then looks away.

                         BAINES
               I don't want you to play. I 
               just want you to sit.

ADA keeps playing until she has finished. Without looking at him she 
holds up two fingers against the piano.

                         BAINES
               (angry) No, not two keys.

ADA starts playing again, BAINES feels powerless. He no longer admires 
her absorption with the piano, he is jealous of it.

                         BAINES
               (shouts) Two keys then!

She stops playing. There is an insolence or casualness in the way she 
regards BAINES. He pulls her chair back from the piano. This upsets 
her, as much of her confidence was associated with the instrument. 
BAINES kisses her passionately on the mouth. ADA pulls back, BAINES 
persists, he is desperate and romantic.


Sc 72     EXT     BASE OF BUSH COVERED HILL     DAY     Sc 72 

STEWART, with BAINES interpreting, talks with a group of MAORIS at the 
base of a bush covered hill. The MAORIS sit behind a small 
representation of the hill marked out with twigs on the ground. The 
atmosphere is tense.

               say? Are they selling? Offer 
               the blankets for half the land.

STEWART holds up his ten fingers and then two more.

The MAORIS look carefully at the quality of the blankets, noting the 
depth of the weave and the strength of the Wool. They shake their 
heads as they discuss them.

BAINES and STEWART walk through the bush. STEWART laden down with his 
blankets, red-faced and irritable.



                         STEWART
What do they want it for? They 
don't cultivate it, burn it 
back, anything. How do they 
even know it's theirs?

BAINES stops as he comes to a freshly placed fence post. STEWART winds 
down his complaints watching BAINES anxiously. BAIXES walks down to 
the next one. he touches the freshly split post.

(tentatively) I thought I might 
as well mark it out.

                         BAINES
Yes, why not.

                         STEWART
Ada says you're doing well with 
the piano?

BAINES keeps walking from post to post.

                         STEWART
I'll have to come and hear you 
play. what do you play.

                         BAINES

time.

Sc 74EXT     STEWARTS VEGETABLE PATCHDAYSc 74

ADA has cut a good sized cabbage in the vegetable patch. She throws it 
to FLORA who misses, dropping it in a pool of mud, spattering her face 
and dress. ADA smiles and FLORA who was about to cry gives the cabbage 
a big football beet towards her mother. ADA's mouth falls open, but 
then she too kicks it and they begin to dribble the mud caked cabbage 
towards the hut, all the time signing playful insults. Into this 
arrives STEWART.

                         STEWART
Baines can't play a damn thing. 
Is that right he can't play a 
thing?

We're going to lose that land, 
the way he was carrying on over 
it.

Is he musical? You've got to 
teach him a song. Something 
simple.

FLORA has her foot on the cabbage, she nudges it off behind her. It 
roll down the hill. STEWART can't help but notice,

                         STEWART
What's that?

He follows the cabbage down the hill' where he scrapes some of the mud 
off.

This thing's been knocked to 
pieces.

Sc 75     INT/EXT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 75

FLORA is seen through BAINES' window Inside, ADA as ever charts her 
progress on the black keys, eleven. She turns to BAINES for 
instructions.  BAINES is not himself, he is sulky and distant.

                         BAINES
Do what you like. Play what you 
like.

ADA is perplexed by this turn about of behaviour. A little 
uncertainly, she sets about her playing. After a little she too turns 
to see what BAINES is doing. He's not there. She is surprised then 
anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few 
keys to go. She starts to play again, but her anxieties prove too 
great. She stops and listens. She looks out the window, where FLORA is 
mucking about in the yard. She walks to his bedroom, listens, then 
opens the door. BAINES stands naked looking at her. ADA is taken aback

                         BAINES
I want to lie together without 
clothes on. How many would that 
be?

ADA holds up ten fingers an impossibly high number of keys.

BAINES nods.

ADA is surprised; she didn't expect him to agree. ADA checks again 
holding up her hands.

                         BAINES
Yes, ten keys.

Hesitantly, she starts to undress. She lies on her petticoat, having 
deemed the bed too dirty. BAINES lies, very still on top of her. A 
scraping sound is heard.

FLORA is outside walking on sticks and logs trying to make sure she 
never puts her foot on the ground. She looks over at the house 
suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again. She 
investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes 
in the loosely built hut. Her vision is always only parts of bodies, 
the venture is one of challenge and curiosity.

Sc 77     EXT     NATIVE PINE FOREST          DAY     Sc 77

FLORA and three small Maori children play amongst some native pines. 
Two MAORI WOMEN smoke and chat nearby. The children rub up and down 
against the tree trunks kissing and hugging them. The game has an edge 
of promiscuity to it as they exchange trunks and hug one tree as a 
group. Unseen by the children STEWART marches towards FLORA. He pulls 
her off the tree.

                         STEWART
               Never behave like that, never 
               any where. You are greatly 
               shamed and you have shamed 
               those trunks. (trees)

The MAORI WOMEN keep up an unacknowledged chant.

               What o'clock say Mr Stewart?
               -Ge Tupeka?

With a bucket of dull soapy water FLORA begins the task of washing the 
tree trunks.

The MAORI WOMEN laugh and point to their feet meaning her to wash them 
too.  Their children are lying in their laps playing string games.

Sc 79     EXT     NATIVE PINE FORESTDUSK     Sc 79

FLORA is still washing the tree trunk silhouetted against the evening

FLORA is tearful and sorry for herself. The job has an increased 
futility as it has begun to rain- STEWART is inspecting her penance. 
She follows STPWART about the trees.

                         FLORA
               (sulkily) I know why Mr. Baines 
               can't play the piano.

                         STEWART
               You've missed this bit.

                         FLORA
               She never gives him a turn.

STEWART stops and looks at her.

               She just plays whatever she 
               pleases, sometimes she doesn't 
               play at all.

STEWART continues through the trees more slowly.

                         STEWART
               And when is the next lesson?

                         FLORA
               Tomorrow.

FLORA puts her bucket on her head to protect herself from the rain.

The next day is very windy, the tops of trees are thrashed by fierce 
gusts of wind and some smaller branches crash to the ground. ADA's 
long dress and cape flap uncontrollably. FLORA's smaller cape stands 
out on end. Birds fly in mad wind-battered courses, swooped up then 
strangely drawn down.

ADA and FLORA arrive at BAINES' place to see the piano emerge from the 
hut carried by six MAORI MEN, one of whom does nothing but walk beside 
it "plonking" the keys. Another group of MAORIS sit cross-legged on 
the verandah playing draughts. Panicked ADA hurries down the hill to 
the hut. FLORA follows behind.

Inside the hut, HIRA, the old woman from the bathing spot, is smoking 
her pipe. ADA enters distraught and indicates what she has seen. Her 
face is flushed and whipped by the wind. She is much more expressive 
than normal.

                         BAINES
               I am giving the piano back to 
               you. I've had enough.  The 
               arrangement is making you a 
               whore and me wretched.
               I want you to care for me, but 
               you can't.

BAINES sits down on a chair and prepares to eat, somewhat ignoring 
ADA. ADA is confused not quite believing the situation. She watches 
BAINES for some kind of confirmation.

                         HIRA
               (softly) George, can I use this 
               comb?


BAINES nods. ADA is still watching. HIRA scrapes the inside of her

ADA is off balanced by the reversal of attitudes, surprised too, that 
she doesn't want to go. FLORA is fast to leave, ADA follows to 
organise and protect her piano on the journey.

As she climbs out of the small valley surrounding BAINES' hut, she 
stops and walks back to look down at BAINES and his hut, in the EXACT 
same manner that she once looked at her piano from the cliff-top above 
the beach. BAINES is throwing the scraps of his meal to his dog, he 
does not look up.

STEWART, on his way to BAINES, sees THE PIANO BEARERS and ADA way 
below him in the bush. He scrambles down a steep slope towards them.

               (stiffly from some distance) 
               Stop right there'. This isn't

The women exchange looks.

STEWART is off, pounding on down through the bush.

HIRA is sitting on the front step of BAINES' place, blocking STEWART'S 
easy access.

               George sick, he don't wanna see 
               nobody. You got Tupeka for the 
               Hira?

STEWART goes around to a side window in BAINES' bedroom. BAINES is 
sitting on the bed, but lies back as he hears STEWART coming about the 
side of the house. STEWART opens up the window.

                         STEWART
               I don't think you should have 
               given up the piano. I will make 
               sure you are properly taught, 
               with music written on to sheets 
               and...

                         BAINES
               I don't want to learn.

                         STEWART
               You don't want to learn.

                         BAINES
               No.

                         STEWART
               And what does this do to our 
               bargain? I cannot afford the 
               piano if you mean me to pay.

                         BAINES
               No, no payment. I have given it 
               back. I don't want it.

                         STEWART
               Well, I doubt I want it very 
               much myself.

                         BAINES
               It was more to your wife that I 
               gave it.

                         STEWART
               Well, thank you, I expect she 
               will appreciate it.

He closes the window.

               So that is agreed on?

BAINES nods.

HIRA has wandered stiffly into BAINES' room. She sits on the edge of 
his bed.

                         HIRA
               You make BIG mistake George. In 
               first place you should swap 
               land for wife. Now look, she

At the door of the hut STEWART is distributing buttons to the piano 
bearers. 
One squats catching them as they fall. A commotion begins as one of 
the MAORIS snatches the whole jar and runs off. Two of them give chase 
while the others insist on tobacco.

Inside the hut ADA had lifted the top of the piano and is peering in 
while playing notes to check tune and damage.

                         STEWART
               Is it all right? Aren't you 
               going to play something?
ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her 
hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over 
her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she 
removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly 
takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her 
happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.

                         FLORA
What will I play?

She looks to ADA, who looks back through her not concentrating.

                         STEWART
Play a gig.

                         FLORA
(to ADA) Do I know any gigs?

                         STEWART
Play a song then

FLORA starts a song, ADA walks past them out of the hut, STEWART 
ignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano. ADA is seen through 
the hut window wandering amidst the ghostly, blackened trunks. 
STEWART'S attention is drawn to ADA, he interrupts FLORA'S singing 
with a sudden outburst.

                         STEWART
(exasperated) Why won't she 
play it? We have it back, and 
she just wanders off!

FLORA stops to watch her mother through the window. ADA looks towards 
the house as the music stops.

                         STEWART
Keep playing!

Grimly STEWART slaps the top of the piano to FLORA's playing.

ADA continues to walk, her face dark and puzzled. She stops. Her head 
stiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction BAINES' hut. 
She peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. 
She thinks and walks on.

Sc 88     INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN     DAY     Sc 88

The next day ADA and her piano face each other across the kitchen. A 
slit of light falls across the piano highlighting it's rosey walnut 
wood. ADA's expression is critical and distant.

Taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. Her finger 
holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its 
side, a small heart, and an arrow. Putting the cloth aside she sits at 
the piano to begin playing.

She starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long 
she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she 
'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But 
once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she 
pauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks 
away. She stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand 
on the lid and one on the piano keys.

Sc 89     EXT     PATH TO BAINES'     DAY     Sc 89

ADA carrying her cape and bonnet hurries through the narrow bush path 
to BAINES' hut, FLORA has a fist of her skirt and is pulling back. ADA 
turns on FLORA and snatches the skirt out of the girl's hand. ADA 
signs to her and continues on.

                         FLORA
Why? Why can't I?

ADA signs again.

                         FLORA
(crossing her arms) I shan't 
practise and I DON'T CARE!

But ADA does not wait to listen. FLORA walks back through the bush 
muttering childish expletives to herself. STEWART and his two MAORI 
helpers come out of the bush towards her. FLORA squeals with fright.

                         STEWART
(looking up the hill) Where's 
your mother? Where has she 
gone?

FLORA pauses petulant and grumpy.

                         FLORA
               To HELL!

FLORA races off as fast as she can, enlivened by her wickedness. 
STEWART clambers back up the path. He just glimpses the distant figure 
of ADA nervously turning, her skirts flying as she hurries up the bush 
path The wind bothers the tops of the trees, setting them groaning, 
rubbing their branches against each other.

Sc 90     INT     BAINES' HUT          DAY     Sc 90

ADA enters BAINES' hut, she is breathless1 announcing her presence by 
simply being there, standing there. BAINES comes through from the 
bedroom. Seeing ADA he is aloof, suspicious and his blinking becomes 
pronounced.

                         BAINES
               So what brings you here? Did 
               you leave something? I have not 
               found anything.

ADA does not respond, finally she looks at BAINES and her look has a 
vulnerability and frankness that takes him off guard.

               Does he know something?

ADA shakes her head.

               The piano is not harmed? It 
               arrived safely? Would you like 
               to sit? I am going to sit.

ADA does not sit. She stands immobilised.  BAINES attempts to maintain 
his casual charade) he pours a tea.

He turns to her about to speak, but stops unmanned by a new fragility 
to her strength. He blinks rapidly

                         BAINES
               Ada, I am unhappy because I 
               want you, because my mind has 
               seized on you and thinks of 
               nothing else. This is how I 
               suffer, I am sick with longing. 
               I don't eat, I don't sleep. If 
               you do not want me, if you have 
               come with no feeling for me, 
               then go!

BAINES walks roughly towards the door and opens it, his softness 
turned suddenly cruel.

               Go! Go NOW! Leave!

ADA is stung by his change of tune, she takes a step towards him and 
eyes filling with tears of anger hits him hard across the face. 
BAINES' nose begins to bleed yet his face slowly lights up as if she 
has spoken words of love. ADA is flushed, shocked, the two face each 
other at this very moment of profound awareness of each other, 
profoundly equal. With each new breath, with every moment that their 
eyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and 
reconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how 
they came to wake where they did, they are standing next to each other 
and beginning to kiss each other, the lips, the cheeks, the nose. 
There is nothing practised about their tenderness, only their feelings 
and emotions guide their instincts. BAINES' face crumples with the 
exquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest. 
BAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin.

Outside STEWART surveys the hut suspiciously. BAINES' dog growls as he 
climbs on to the small verandah. Carefully STEWART peers through some 
loosely slatted boards. There are sounds inside which are worrying 
him. By standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see 
ADA and BAINES kissing, undressing

He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, 
he steps up to look again; the fatal second look, the look for 
curiosity. He watches BAINES bare-chested undressing ADA, her buttons 
burst, ADA laughs, BAINES touches her under her skirts - anywhere, he 
takes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings. STEWART 
watches, stepping down to peer lower as BAINES buries into ADA's 
skirt. He does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand. Suddenly 
he pulls his hand away and looks at it, wet with dog saliva, he wipes 
it on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised.

Sc 92     INT     BAINES' BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 92

Inside BAINES' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the 
softness, whiteness of BAINES' and ADA's bodies, The long black 
strands of ADA's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. Her 
face is flushed and her eyes are bright. BAINES rolls his face across 
her chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. Drunkenly 
they continue their sex slowly, slowly. ADA's breaths turn to low 
murmurs; these small sounds are extraordinarily moving to BAINES whose 
face swoons with joy.

                         BAINES
               What?  What?  whisper....

As ADA dresses, BAINES sits on his bed watching. He is unhappy, 
thoughtful.

                         BAINES
               Now you are going I am 
               miserable, why is that? (He 
               catches her hand and draws her 
               to hint) Ada I need to know, 
               what will you do? Will you come 
               again?

ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at 
the time past, worried to dress and return.

The camera cranes down and down to find STEWART wedged under the loose 
wooden floor slats. He cannot hear clearly, but ADA's hand reaching 
for each button is only inches away. One falls through a slat on to 
STEWART'S neck and on down his shirt collar. As she stands he rolls 
out.

                         BAINES
               Wait! I don't know what you're 
               thinking. (gently, teasingly) 
               Does this mean something to 
               you? Hey? (Stroking a strand of 
               hair behind her ear) I already 
               miss you. Ada, do you love me?

ADA considers this question. Clearly she doesn't know, the question is 
more complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she 
kisses him strongly and sexually. BAINES pulls away confused. ADA 
finishes dressing. BAINES comes up behind her to help with the 
buttons.

                         BAINES
               (anxiously) Come tomorrow. If 
               you are serious, come tomorrow.

ADA turns and kisses him passionately, with the new born enthusiasm of 
someone who has just discovered their appetite for sex. Then as 
quickly as she began, she takes her hood and cape and goes to leave.

                         BAINES
               Tomorrow?

She nods and is gone.

FLORA and ADA are both in their white nightgowns. FLORA stands behind 
ADA on a chair trying to sort out the knots that have matted at the 
back of ADA's head. ADA shakes her head from side to side playfully, 
making the difficult job impossible.

                         FLORA
               Stay still! It's the very worst

FLORA tries to hold her mother's head still but ADA's high spirits are 
unstoppable and her hair flies out from side to side flicking FLORA in 
the face.

FLORA starts to giggle and retaliates flinging her own hair from side 
to side. The two women are twirling in the small bedroom their hair 
flying about them, FLORA is shrieking with the fun, then stops dizzy 
and sick. ADA continues flicking FLORA as she twirls.

Music builds and plays throughout.) The sky is dark and the wind is 
ballooning ADA's cape, wrapping it up high around her. The tree tops 
are swaying furiously. Inside the bush it is dark and ADA hurries up 
through the path. She is out or breath and glancing behind her as if 
to guard against followers, when directly in front of her STEWART 
steps out onto her path. ADA stops short. The look on his face is 
unlike any expression she has yet seen. His eyes do not look at her, 
but all about her in a way more animal than human. She lowers her eyes 
and calling his bluff walks steadily past him. But STEWART takes her 
arm and spinning her back, pulls her close and blind to all protest 
kisses her. ADA struggles furiously. His grip falters and she steps 
back staring at him, then runs off down the hill, but STEWART is on 
top of her clasping her skirts, pulling her towards him hand over 
hand, she slips and falls to the ground. STEWART is upon her, lifting 
her dress, touching her legs, ADA goes quite still, which throws 
STEWART long enough for her to scramble away, yet again STEWART 
catches her and again they roll on the ground, STEWART touching and 
kissing her, ADA turning herself this way and that to avoid it. There 
is a cat and mouse quality to their mute struggle finally broken by 
FLORA calling up the path, distraught and in tears, her angel wings 
have twisted about her waist.

ADA's face pales in the diminishing light. Exasperated by the 
threatened incarceration she shakes her head with anguish and moving 
to the piano lifts the lid and plays several bars brutally and 
strongly. She passes on to the bedroom, where she picks up the small 
hand mirror and looks at her face puckered with frustration. She 
touches her face and neck tenderly, then throws herself on the bed, 
face to the wall, her hands over her ears.

FLORA stands over her mother.

               can play cards together.

ADA rolls over, her eyes closed she pushes her face and body against 
the mattress. The movement is sensual and removed. FLORA stops dealing 
the cards on to the bed and watches her mother puzzled.

STEWART carries a lit candle. ADA continues her playing

FLORA passes a hand in front of ADA's face.

sleep with his candle still alight. ADA looks, then slowly her hand 
hovers above him before lightly touching his face. His eyes open, he 
looks towards ADA anxious and surprised, but as ADA continues, his 
reserve breaks and he is captive to his own sensations. She pulls down 
the sheet and strokes his neck, shoulders, chest, he reaches out 
towards her.

But ADA scowls and pulls away roughly, STEWART lies back anxious not 
to break the spell and when he is still ADA continues to caress his 
chest. His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a 
child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting. ADA continues like a 
nurse spreading ointment on a wound, tenderly and attentively she 
strokes down towards his belly. STEWART'S skin goose bumps and be 
shudders. He puts his hand on hers to still it1 she slides hers out 
and continues stroking. He looks at her pleadingly and childlike, she 
stops and kisses the soft skin of his belly, STEWART groans clutching 
the mattress. ADA seems removed from STEWART as if she has a separate 
curiosity of her own.

Sc 105INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN          DAY     Sc 105

Next day AUNT MORAG stands circling in STEWART'S small darkened house. 
FLORA and ADA sit quietly together

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a 
               dank cave.

                         NESSIE
               Yes, like a cave.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!

STEWART comes into the house with some logs, AUNT MORAG follows him 
across to the fire.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Alisdair, is it because of our 
               play? Have the natives 
               aggressed you?


She continues following him to the door.

I have to say you have done the wrong thing here, you see you have put 
the latch on the outside. When you close the door, (and she doses it) 
it will be the Macna that lock you in, you see? With the latch on that 
side you are quite trapped.

                         NESSIE
               (nodding her head in imitation) 
               ... you are quite trapped.

AUNT MORAG walks inside and continues to the table where her basket 
full of clothes and packets of food have been left. She lifts it from 
the table and begins to spread the cloth.

                         AUNT MORAG
               We have just come from George 
               Banes' and they have taken him 
               over. It is no wonder he is 
               leaving, he has got in too deep 
               with the natives. They sit on 
               his floor as proud as Kings, 
               but without a shred of manners.

                         NESSIE
               (in unison) ... without a shred 
               of manners.

NESSIE and AUNT MORAG are unpacking parcels of cakes and biscuits
 on plates putting them about the table.

                         AUNT MORAG
               He is quite altered, as if they 
               had been trying some native 
               witchcraft on him. Well 
               tomorrow or the day after he 
               will be gone.

                         STEWART
               Baines is packing up?

                         AUNT MORAG
               Well he has NOTHING to pack, 
               but he is leaving. And it is 
               just as well; Nessie has 
               foolishly grown an affection 
               for him ... we have had some 
               tears

At this mention NESSlE's face crumples and tears again begin to flow.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (very firmly) STOP IT! STOP! 

NESSIE remarkably obeys, blinking her face back to shape.

ADA attempts to disguise her agitation, she moves to the piano and 
strokes it, she begins to play.

               I am quite frightened of the 
               way back, we must leave in good 
               light. Will we be safe?

                         STEWART
               (wanting them gone) If you 
               leave soon, yes, I am sure of 
               it.

STEWART and MORAG watch ADA at the piano. Her playing develops until 
she is fully absorbed. AUNT MORAG is intrigued despite herself

Sc 106EXT     BUSY ROAD TO MISSIONDAY     Sc 106

On the edge of the bush beside the dirt road to town AUNT MORAG 
attempts a discrete toilet stop. NESSIE keeps guard holding up the 
cape while one of their MAORI charges holds up another.

                         AUNT MORAG
               You know I am thinking of the 
               piano. She does not play the 
               piano as we do Nessie.

The cape begins to droop as NESSIE listens.

               UP! UP! No she is a strange 
               creature and her saying is 
               strange like a mood that passes 
               into you. You cannot teach that 
               Nessie, one may like to learn 
               but that could not be taught.

NESSIE again lets the cape droop.

               Up! Your playing is plain and 
               true and that is what I like. 
               To have a sound creep inside 
               you is not all pleasant

A fluttering sound in the bush.

               what is that?

                         NESSIE
               (frightened) Ohhhhhh!

                         MARY/HENI
               (slow, relaxed) A pid-geon 
               Auntie.

The party finish and hurry a little spooked on the road to town.

Sc 107INT     STEWART'S ROOM     NIGHT     Sc 107

It is night. ADA enters the room, STEWART looks at her shyly.

                         STEWART
               I've been hoping you would 
               come.

ADA strokes his brow. STEWART closes his eyes, breathing heavily 
relieved. ADA strokes the nape of his neck and on down his back. 
STEWART'S face puckers, his eyes fill with tears. She strokes so 
softly, the tenderness is shocking to him. Gently she pulls his under-
garment down, exposing his buttocks. STEWART grabs nervously at them, 
hauling them up with his hands. ADA unclenches his fist and once more, 
slowly pulls them down. She begins to stroke his buttocks, STEWART is 
painfully eroticised, painfully vulnerable, he begins to weep, the 
intimacy and soft-ness unman him and he is helpless. STEWART sits up 
hunching over himself, retreating

                         STEWART
               I want to touch you Why can't I 
               touch you? Do you like me?

Slowly he raises his head to look at ADA. She looks back moved by his 
helplessness, but distanced as if it has nothing to do with her.

               Do you?

ADA does not respond. STEWART slumps into disappointment and despair.

               Why? Why not?!

Sc 108INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN     DAY     Sc 108

The next morning, ADA, FLORA and STEWART sit together in the small 
dark hut. FLORA preens a miniature landscape of moss and tiny branches 
all piled on a dinner plate. A slit of sunlight falling across the top 
small branches gives it a magical glow. FLORA's small dirty fingers 
push in another 'tree', she looks up happily

                         FLORA
This is going to be Adam's tree 
and then I'm going to make a 
serpent to live here, with a 
very long tongue. (She pokes 
her tongue out and waggles it).

STEWART reads, he glances at ADA who is glum and lifeless.

Sc 109INT     STEWART'S HUT     DAY     Sc 109

ADA and FLORA wake to sunlight streaming in on their faces, more and 
more of it as STEWART rips the boards from the windows FLORA runs 
about in nightgown and boots happy to be in the sunlight. ADA winds 
her hair into a bun. STEWART walks inside, he packs food and fencing 
equipment

                         STEWART
               (Clears his throat) We must 
               both get on. I have decided to 
               trust you to stay here. You 
               will not see Baines?

               (ADA nods) Good, good. Perhaps 
               with more trying you will come 
               to like me?

Sc 110EXT     STEWART'S          DAY     Sc 110

ADA hangs out washing restlessly scanning the bushline. A tiny STEWART 
walks along the crest of the hill, eventually dropping out of sight.

Sc 111INT     STEWART'S HUT     DAY     Sc 111

Inside the hut ADA is pacing, anguished and frustrated. Impulsively 
she picks up a knife from the kitchen table, opens the back of the 
piano and cuts one of the keys loose. Carefully she engraves on the 
side in Victorian handscript.

DEAR GEORGE, YOU HAVE MY HEART. ADA McGRATH.

Sc 112EXT     STEWART'S          DAY     Sc 112

Under the sheets FLORA has constructed a dolls' clothes line on which 
she hangs small strips of cloth ADA hands her the key wrapped and tied 
in white cotton. ADA signs. Her black shadow behind the sheet recalls 
the macabre play.

               No!

The little girl continues defiantly with her miniature washing. ADA 
rips the washing line up and flings it aside. FLORA is shocked, 
stunned. She takes the key and walking off she turns and shouts.

                         FLORA
               We're not supposed to visit 
               him'.

ADA signals GO!


Sc 113EXT     PATH TO BAINES' AT FENCEDAYSc 113

At the junction of the path to BAINES' hut is the beginning of 
STEWART'S boundary fence. At this place FLORA has paused. She looks 
back to see if her mother is watching; she's not- FLORA turns sharply 
right so that she now follows alongside STEWART'S boundary fence and-
away from BAINES' hut.

Sc 114EXT     HILLS WITH FENCE     DAY     Sc 114
The fence appears and disappears behind hills.  Flora too dips behind 
the hills to reappear on the other side. She sings a brisk song to 
herself.

                         FLORA
               The grand old Duke of York. He 
               had ten thousand men etc.

She pauses in one of the valleys, stifled by clumps or tall, mauve 
foxglove.

Sc 116EXT     COMPLETE FENCE ON HILLDAY     Sc 116
The fence line seems endless as the tired FLOW4 trudges up yet another 
hill but from there, she can see where the fence finishes, half way up 
the crest of the next hill and at this point is STEWART, driving in a 
new fence post. He is watched by MANA and his friend who squat passing 
a pipe between themselves. MANA strums tirelessly on his buttons.

                         FLORA
               Mumma wanted me to give this to 
               Mr. Baines.

She holds out the cotton covered piano key. STEWART looks up.

               I thought maybe it was not a 
               proper thing to do. 

STEWART keeps working, hammering the post into the earth.

               Shall I open it?

                         STEWART
               No!!

He stops and takes the key, suspicious and uncomfortable. He slowly 
unwraps it and turning it over reads it. Squeezing the key in his 
fist, STEWART staggers off in a daze, He returns, picks up his open 
pack spilling the nails. Finally he drops the pack and the key) and 
leaves with only his axe. FLORA follows confused. The MAORIS waste no 
time investigating the booty. MANA presses the piano key repeatedly.

                         MANA

The sky is dark and rain is falling heavily as STEWART strides fast 
towards the hut, his axe swinging in his hand. FLORA is far behind 
him, her angelwings sodden.

Sc 118INT     STEWART'S HUT     DAY     Sc 118

STEWART bursts into the hut, his wet hair is splattered against his 
forehead. his face is white. ADA looks up from her book, moving her 
hands from the table. STEWART swings his axe hard. It slices into the 
table, splitting a section off her book. ADA pushes her chair back.

                         STEWART
               (exasperated) why? WHY? I 
               trusted you!

He pulls the axe out of the table and swings it at the piano.

               WHY?

ADA runs forward to restrain him, but it sinks deep into the wood. The 
struck piano lets ont a strange resonant moan.

               I trusted you, do you hear? I 
               trusted you. I could love you.

He takes her by the wrist.

               Why do you do this? Why do you 
               make me hurt you? Do you bear? 
               Why have you done it? We could 
               be happy

STEWART shakes her violently.

               You have made me angry. SPEAK!!

Sc 119EXT     STEWART'S HUT & WOODCHOPDAY     Sc 119

He pulls her out of the hut, past the now terrified FLORA.

               You shall answer for this. 
               Speak or not you shall answer for 
               it!

He drags her out through the mud, towards the wood chop. It is raining 
hard.

ADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared. She 
bucks and struggles, but STEWART is infinitely stronger. At the wood 
chop she breaks free and crawls away through the woodchips and mud. 
But axe in hand he grasps her by the neck of her dregs, then her hair, 
and pulls her backwards towards the cutting block. There, he takes her 
right hand and holds it in place with his boot, so that only ADA's 
index finger shows, ADA's head is held twisted between the wood chop 
and STEWART'S leg.

                         STEWART
               (anguished) Do you love him? Do 
               you?! Is it him you love?

ADA blinks rigid with fear. The rain is driving down.

                         FLORA
               No, she says NOOOOOO!!!

The axe falls. ADA's face buckles in pain. Blood squirts onto FLORA's 
white pinafore, her angel wings are splattered in mud.

                         FLORA
               (Screaming) Mother!!

ADA stands. She looks faint, her finger is pulsing blood, she shakes 
her hand then seeing the blood she puts it behind her back shocked. 
She watches FLORA, concerned and confused. Uncontrollably her whole 
body starts to shake and as if by reflex ADA begins to walk. FLORA 
trots parallel to her.

                         FLORA
               Mama!

ADA keeps walking blindly like her being depends on it. Her face is 
ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large 
tree stump. She sinks into the mud.

STEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA 
who backs away from him terrified.

                         FLORA
               (quietly) Mama.

                         STEWART
               Take this to Baines. Tell him 
               if he ever tries to see her again 
               I'll take off another and another 
               and another!

The figures seem tiny amidst the rain drenched skeleton forest.

Sc 121EXT     MAORI PA     DAY     Sc 121

The formal farewells are over and HIRA and BAINES finishes shaking 
hands and pressing noses with her people.

HIRA holds his arm, she is sad and tearful. He places his hat on her 
head affectionately and slips her a much appreciated tin of tobacco.

A soft rain begins to fall. BAINES and HIRA make their way past the 
Meeting House and the low sleeping houses to the Pa entrance where his 
horse waits,

                         HIRA

               cunning like wind, KNOCK you

               they say, how can pakeha get 
               our land if we won't sell it?"

A crowd of children run beside them, dogs scurry off and pigs are 
kicked out of the way, their owners protesting loudly. Some hold mats 
over their heads to protect themselves from the rain, one has a 
battered umbrella.

                         HIRA
               They wrong Peini. We need guns 
               to hold it.

BAINES mounts his heavily laden horse. MANA pushes forward to say his 
farewell, but is abruptly shoved aside, evidently unpopular with the 
others. BAINES glances over and sees the piano key the man has 
fashioned into an earring.

                         HIRA

               nowhere to go.

HIRA's voice rises as BAINES lets go of her arm and rides through the 
group towards MANA. He takes the piano key in his hand, MANA pulls 
back.

waist to bold up his trousers. In the paddock are five very shabby 
looking rides'. one huge old wagon horse, built to carry a whole 
family, down to a tiny sour looking Shetland. The girls have long, 
stained, once white pinafores and everyone wears boots that seem too 
big, except the little boy who has the front cut off his hoots so his 
toes can hang out.

Four little girls play a sedate game of skip rope, using a bush vine.  
BAINES watches, noticing in particular a little girl of about 9 with a 
bock. The boys and some of the wilder girls play BullRush.

BAINES holds out the packet to the little girl. 

               Don't give her one.

BAINES does anyway.

                         BIG SISTER
               She can't read.

The little girl throws the lolly paper away, which one of the other 
girls picks up and sniffs, she hands it to the others.

               Mmm Caramels

                         BAINES
               Can you read?

He holds out the piano key BIG SISTER takes it with great authority, 
her friends crowd behind her. She frowns at the writing. She turns it 
over.

                         BIG SISTER
               Running writing, we haven't 
               done that yet.

                         READING GIRL
               Myrtle can read it, her mother 
               taught her.

The key is snatched from BIG SISTER and given to MYRTLE, the girl with 
the book. The others crowd around.

                         MYRTLE
               (frowning) D e a r  G e o r g e

The children look over at BAINES to see if this is right so far.

               You (in unison)... have

                         BIG SISTER
               That's "My".

               it doesn't make sense) Ada 
               McGrath.

                         BIG SISTER
               It doesn't make sense.

The little girls read it again together. MYRTLE turns the key over 
matter of factly to see if there is more writing.

                         MYRTLE
               That's all

They all look up at him.

                         BAINES
               Say it again, just you.

Everyone turns and listens to MYRTLE

                         MYRTLE
               Dear George you have my heart, 
               Ada McGrath.

She gives a little "Is that all?" gesture.

                         BAINES
               You say it. (He points to BIG 
               SISTER, who has a crazy deep 
               voice.)

                         BIG SISTER
               Dear George you have my heart, 
               Ada McGrath.


Another little girl spontaneously recites the message. And so does 
another. Through all this BAINES keeps his bead down shaking it in 
disbelief and shy happiness. He starts to laugh with relief and 
pleasure. The little girls think it is something funny in the line and 
continue to repeat it, which each then appears to give BAINES fresh 
pleasure. Meanwhile the smallest of the girls is quietly helping 
herself to the sweets.

BAINES jumps off his horse and strides into his hut.

Inside he finds FLORA crouching in a corner, her face is white, tear 
stained and splattered with mud. Her angel wings are squashed behind 
her and blood stained. On seeing BAINES she cries with renewed pain 
and relief

                         BAINES
               What has happened? Hush, hush, 
               what is it?

FLORA thrusts the wrapped finger at BAINES. He takes the blood soaked 
object and unwraps it. The finger unravels into his hand, he reels 
back groaning, choking about to be sick.

                         FLORA

               What happened?

But FLORA cannot speak. She bursts into loud sobs. BAINES kneels in 
front of her shaking her.

               TELL ME! TELL ME!

BAINES stops shaking her, she scrambles away and out the door. BAINES 
chases after her.

away.

STEWART walks outside his hut disconsolate.

Sc 133INT     STEWART'S HUT     NIGHT     Sc 133

STEWART enters ADA's room with a lamp. He puts it down beside her on 
the table. He studies her pale face and dry lips. ADA's eyes flicker 
open.

                         STEWART
               (speaking to his feet) 
               I lost my temper. I'm sorry.

STEWART looks at ADA.

                         STEWART
               You broke my trust, you pushed 
               me hard, to hard. (he sighs) 
               You cannot send love to HIM you 
               cannot do it.  Even to think on 
               it makes me angry, very angry

ADA opens her eyes and looks at STEWART. It is evident she hears 
nothing and has understood nothing, she is struggling with pain. Her 
face grimaces and she groans.

                         STEWART
               I meant to love you. I clipped 
               your wing, that is all.

STEWART sings two lines of an English love ballad to ADA.

                         STEWART
               We shall be together, you will 
               see it will be better...

Her forehead is damp with fever. She thrashes at the blankets. STEWART 
pulls them off to cool her. He feels her brow.

                         STEWART
               (whispering) ... 
               my love bird.

Her nightgown is damp with sweat and clings to her body. STEWART 
reaches out to adjust her gown, his hand touches her leg and he holds 
it there, feeling a tingle of pleasure, that grows and builds the 
longer his hand remains.

                         STEWART
               Ohhhhh my love

His hand begins to move further and further up her leg, nudging the 
nightgown higher and higher. He looks at her face. She is closed-eyed, 
unconscious. STEWART'S face crinkles into a pained expression and all 
his control melts into a drive to hold and extend this moment. He 
brings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee, her thigh. A 
new thought occurs to him, a terrible thought, but as he has phrased 
the thought to himself, he cannot resist it. He glances at her face 
still fevered and unconscious. Quietly, stealthily, he begins to undo 
his belt buckle. He bends across her to gently separate her legs. As 
he moves his body over her, he looks towards her and to his shame and 
horror she is looking directly back at him, her eyes perfectly on his, 
perfectly focused. Quietly STEWART moves back and pulls down her gown, 
all the time keeping his eyes on her.

                         STEWART
               You are feeling better?

ADA's lips move slightly and STEWART turns suddenly as if he has heard 
something. Slowly he turns back to ADA.

STEWART looks at ADA intently, moving closer to her bed, closer to ADA 
his eyes locked on hers.

                         STEWART
               What...?

The sound of his own voice makes him blink. He watches her as if 
listening to her speak in a voice that is so faint, and distant, that 
only with great concentration and perseverance can he make it out. As 
he watches her his face transforms; his eyes fill, his lips soften and 
his eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own.

The kerosene lamp burns fitfully, fluttering a light pulse across 
their faces. STEWART moves closer to ADA. Outside a wind bangs the 
iron roof and rubs branches against each other making a high-pitched 
see-saw sound. He leans closer still.

STEWART carrying a candle in a glass box makes his way through ghostly 
tree stumps. In his other arm he has his gun.

At BAINES' hut STEWART steps over the curled figure of HIRA sleeping 
on the verandah and walks through the hut towards the bedroom where a 
lit candle flickers.

Sc 136INT     BAINES' BEDROOMNIGHT     Sc 136

In the bed lies FLORA wrapped in a blanket with BAINES beside her, axe 
in hand, both fast asleep. STEWART nudges BAINES awake with the butt 
of his rifle prodding him under the chin. BAINES wakes rudely with a 
start, frozen by the sight of STEWART and his rifle.

                         STEWART
               Put that away, on the floor.

BAINES obeys, careful not to disturb the sleeping child. STEWART sits 
near the bed on a box, resting his gun across his knee, his face is 
glowing, he looks closely at BAINES, examining him.

                         STEWART
               I look at you, at your face. I 
               have had that face in my head 
               hating it. But now I am here 
               seeing it ... it's nothing, you 
               blink, you have your mark, you 
               look at me through your eyes, 
               yes. you are even scared of me

STEWART laughs.

                         STEWART
               Look at you!

BAINES watches him stiffly, disconcerted, unable to read STEWART'S 
strange mood. STEWART stares back at him.

                         STEWART
               (softly) 
               Has Ada ever spoken to you?

                         BAINES
               You mean in signs?

                         STEWART
               No, words. You have never heard 
               words?

                         BAINES
               No, not words.

STEWART nods.

                         STEWART
               Never thought you heard words?

BAINES shakes his head.


                         STEWART
               (slowly) 
               She has spoken to me. I heard 
               her voice. There was no sound, 
               but I beard it here (he presses 
               his forehead with a palm of his 
               hand). Her voice was there in 
               my head. I watched her lips, 
               they did not make the words, 
               yet the harder I listened the 
               clearer I heard her, as clear 
               as I hear you, as dear as I 
               hear my own voice.

                         BAINES
               (trying to understand) 
               Spoken words?

                         STEWART
               No, but her words are in my 
               head. (he looks at BAINES and 
               pauses) I know what you think, 
               that it's a trick, that I'm 
               making it up. No, the words I 
               heard, were her words.

                         BAINES
               (suspiciously) What are they?

STEWART looks up at the ceiling as if reciting something he has learnt 
by heart and means to repeat exactly as he heard it.

                         STEWART
               She said, "I have to go, let me 
               go, let Baines take me away, 
               let him try and save me. I am 
               frightened of my will, of what 
               it might do it is so strange 
               and strong".

BAINES recovering himself eyes STEWART angrily.

                         BAINES
               You punished her wrongly, it 
               was me, my fault.

STEWART does not answer. Finally be looks up, his eyes full with 
tears.

                         STEWART
               Understand me. I am here for 
               her, for her I wonder that I 
               don't wake, that I am not 
               asleep to be here talking with 
               you. I love her. But what is 
               the use? She doesn't care for 
               me. I wish her gone. I wish you 
               gone. I want to wake and find 
               it was a dream, that is what I 
               want. I want to believe I am 
               not this man. I want my self 
               back; the one I know.

FLORA moves and turns in her sleep. The two men watch. Her brow frowns 
then smoothes. Her eyelids roll as her eyes dart back and forth in 
dream.

                         FLORA
               She says, throw it overboard. 
               She doesn't want it. She says 
               it's spoiled

               I have the key here, look, I'll 
               have it mended...

ADA mimes directly to BAINES, "PUSH IT OVER". Her determination is 
increasing.

(softly, urgently) Please, Ada, 
you will regret it. It's your 
piano, I want you to have it.

But ADA does not listen, she is adamant and begins to untie the ropes.

                         FLORA
               (panicking)
               She doesn't want IT!

The canoe is unbalancing as ADA struggles with the ropes.

                         BAINES
               All right. sit down, sit down.

ADA sits, pleased. Her eyes glow and her face is now alive.

BAINES speaks to the MAORIS who stop paddling and together they loosen 
the ropes securing the piano to the canoe.

As they maneuver the piano to the edge ADA Jocks into the water. She 
puts her hand into the sea and moves it back and forth.

The piano is carefully lowered and with a heave topples over. As the 
piano splashes into the sea, the loose ropes speed their way after it. 
ADA watches them snake past her feet and then out of a fatal 
curiosity, odd and undisciplined, she steps into a loop.

The rope tightens and grips her foot so that she is snatched into the 
sea, and pulled by the piano down through the cold water.

Sc 146INT     SEA NEAR BEACH     DAY     Sc 146

Bubbles tumble from her mouth. Down she falls, on and on. her eyes are 
open, her clothes twisting about her. The MAORIS diving after her 
cannot reach her in these depths. ADA begins to struggle. She kicks at 
the rope, but it holds tight around her boot. She kicks hard again and 
then with her other foot, levers herself free from her shoe. The piano 
and her shoe continue their fall while ADA floats above, suspended in 
the deep water, then suddenly her body awakes and fights, struggling 
upwards to the surface.

As ADA breaks the surface her VOICE OVER begins:

               Still it has had me spooked and 
               many others besides!

ADA coughing and spluttering is pulled on to the canoe. She is wrapped 
in jackets and blankets.

               above it. Down there everything 
               is so still and silent that it 
               lulls me to sleep. It is a 
               weird lullaby and so it is; it 
               is mine.

ADA's piano on the seabed, its lid fallen away. Above floats ADA, her 
hair and arms stretched out in a gesture of surrender, her body slowly 
turning on the end of the rope. The seaweed's rust coloured fronds 
reach out to touch her.

THERE IS A SILENCE WHERE HATH BEEN NO SOUND
THERE IS A SILENCE WHERE NO SOUND MAY BE

                         ADA (VO - Scs 2 to 7)
               The voice you hear is not my 
               speaking voice, but my mind's 
               voice.

               I have not spoken since I was 
               six years old. No one knows 
               why, not even me. My father 
               says it is a dark talent and 
               the day I take it into my head 
               to stop breathing will be my 
               last.

               Today he married me to a man 
               I've not yet met. Soon my 
               daughter and I shall join him 
               in his own country. My husband 
               said my muteness does not 
               bother him. He writes and hark 
               this: God loves dumb creatures, 
               so why not he!

               Were good he had God's patience 
               for silence affects everyone in 
               the end. The strange thing is I 
               don't think myself silent, that 
               is, because of my piano. I 
               shall miss it on the journey.

The woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears 
luminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, 
the objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands 
unconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves 
to a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she 
begins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved, 
unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie 
accompaniment to the music.

An old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing. 
The emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall.

Sc 9     EXT     BEACH                    DAY     Sc 9

Amidst a riotous sea a woman, ADA, is carried to shore on the 
shoulders of five seamen. Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the 
men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her 
pad and pen. We should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial 
offering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited. A 
black sand backs on to an endless rise of dense native bush.

The breakers are chaotic, the men strain to keep their footing, 
calling to each other.

                         SEAMEN
               Hold still you smutt! Blast the 
               boat!
               Look up! Look up!
               Lay to! Lay to.
               Up with it you buggerers, hold 
               hard!
               Damn me won't you hold?!
               Etc.

Two of the men are black, all are battered, tattooed and tough, some 
are drunk.
Behind the woman is her daughter, a girl of ten in Scottish dress. She 
too is carried on the shoulders of seamen.

ADA is placed on the sand. She looks down at her feet sinking into the 
wet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of 
her. The sound of sea behind is thunderous.

Several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand.


Her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick. But ADA's attention 
is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a 
huge piano shaped box. They put it down as soon as they get to 5hore 
but ADA makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher 
safer ground. The piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it, 
one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free 
hand.

Sc 10     EXT     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 10

TWO SEAMEN finish carrying the last crate to shore. Trunks and boxes 
including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the 
shore.

The SEAMEN gather together. After a discussion in which they look 
between ADA and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the 
men approaches. Behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or 
down on the sand. They don't want to be involved. The sight of the 
women alone on this beach is too hopeless.

                         SEAMEN
               It's a little rough out there. 
               Could be they can't get through 
               to you in this weather. Maybe 
               they'll come over land.

ADA nods.

                         SEAMEN
               Have you things for shelter?

ADA nods.

                         SEAMEN
               What things have you?

ADA signs to her daughter. The little girl speaks clearly and loudly 
without emotion.

                         FLORA
               She says, "thank you".

Puzzled, the man walks off, then turns and comes back.

                         SEAMEN
               Does your mother prefer to come 
               on with us to Nelson?

ADA signs vigorously to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               She says, No. She says she'd 
               rather be boiled alive by 
               natives than get back in your 
               tub.

                         SEAMEN
               (stunned) You be damn fortuned 
               I don't smack your puppy gob,

ADA is sheltering behind the crated piano, anxiety etched on her face.

FLORA  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has 
found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play 
a few notes. The sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to 
exaggerate their isolation and hopelessness.

Suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of 
the piano wetting her shoes. ADA stands, pushing FLORA onto her feet. 
She is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed.

They watch three of their boxes float out to sea. One of the hens has 
escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves.

There is just a pink streak left in the sky. ADA and FLORA shelter 
inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges 
with stones.  Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation.

ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous 
and afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the "telling", her face is 
alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, 
while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is 
an odd shadow play.

                         FLORA

Sc 15     EXT     BUSH ON WAY TO BEACH          DAY     Sc 15

Through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen MAORI people and two 
EUROPEAN MEN. The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such 
that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the 
MAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a 
mixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small 
and has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his 
cheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy 
and out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then 
slows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the 
green foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows.

                         BAINES
               Are we stopping?... Do you want 
               to stop?

The MAORI voices and laughter are becoming fainter. BAINES watches 
torn between his concern for STEWART and the split in their party.

                         BAINES

Unable to get an answer BAINES runs after the MAORIS.

STEWART takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through 
his wet hair. Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and 
over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us 
to see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he 
secretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on 
ahead possessed and determined.

                         STEWART
               We must get on.

The MAORIS look at BAINES bewildered.

It is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The 
party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to 
the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline 
where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of 
containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their 
arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART 
automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, 
where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a 
formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The 
party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its 
occupants.

                         STEWART
               Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart.

               I've got men here to carry your 
               things.

ADA and FLORA struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of 
men and women. The MAORIS stare curiously and comment on the women.

               Aut he anahera enci?

FLORA is struck by shyness and hides under her mother's skirt. ADA 
cannot look straight at STEWART and STEWART also cannot look at her.

                         STEWART
               I see you have a good many 
               boxes, I'd like to know what is 
               in each.

As ADA does not move STEWART is puzzled.

                         STEWART
               CAN - YOU - HEAR - ME?

ADA nods and looks up coldly, insulted by his slow loud speaking.

                         STEWART
               Well that is good, yes that is 
               good, good.

STEWART smiling searches ADA's face for some sign of comprehension but 
is unnerved by her lack of response. He stops smiling, and, patting 
his hair walks to the closest box. Several of the MAORI party follow 
behind STEWART while one of them closely and particularly mimics him.


                         STEWART
               What's in here?

ADA points to the writing already on the box saying "Crockery and 
Pots".

                         STEWART
               Ohh, yes so it is, written 
               there, crockery.

                         STEWART
               And this one?

ADA writes "bedclothes and linen" on the pad around her neck- While 
she writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her.

                         STEWART
               You're small. I never thought 
               you'd be small.

He walks to another chest

                         STEWART
               What's here?

She writes "clothes". The MAORI mimic also pretends to write.

Finally he comes to the piano box. He lifts a corner experimentally.

                         STEWART
               What's in here then, lead?

                         FLORA
               (gravely) It's my mother's 
               piano.

                         STEWART
               A piano?

The MAORIS touch the exposed legs of the piano.  STEWART speaks to the 
other European man BAINES.

                         STEWART
               Tell them to carry in pairs. 

               Those three and those two the 
               black and the red, then the 
               suitcases.

STEWART holds BAINES back a moment.

                         STEWART
               What do you think?

STEWART nods towards ADA. BAINES thinks a moment then turns towards 
ADA too.

                         BAINES
               She looks tired.

                         STEWART
               She's stunted, that's one 
               thing.

BAINES walks over to HONE a big man and the MAORJ leader, he stands 
tall with a great sense of his own importance. (Mana)

                         BAINES
               Anei nga pouaka - ko era e 
               toro.
               Me era e raa.
               (Here are the boxes, those 
               three and those two.) 
                    UNSUBTITLED

                         HONE
               E Hoal

HONE takes an aggressive fighting posture towards BAINES, insulted 
that BAINES should suggest he might carry anything. HONE does not 
carrying, he is the boss. With great dignity HONE retreats, too 
injured to help. Other MAORIS come up and BAINES assigns them boxes. 
ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone. She writes on her 
pad, "THE PIANO?" She shows STEWART.

                         STEWART
               Oh no, it can't come now.

                         FLORA
               It must come.

STEWART looks at FLORA

                         FLORA
               She wants it to come.

                         STEWART
               Yes and so do I, but there are 
               too few of us here to carry it. 
               TOO - HEAVY

ADA writes "I NEED THE PIANO." Her MAORI mimic copies her.

                         STEWART
               Do you mean you don't want your 
               kitchenware or your clothes? Is 
               that what you mean?

ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               We can't leave the piano

                         STEWART
               Let us not discuss this 
               further. I am very pleased....

STEWART slows down as he watches ADA again sign to FLORA, he has the 
uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted.

                         FLORA
               Mother wants to know if they 
               could come back directly for 
               it?

STEWART is shocked, his mouth hangs slightly open, paused in mid 
speech. TAHU mimics this mouth drop perfectly.

                         FLORA
               After they have taken the other 
               things?

STEWART is growing confused and anxious. His two mimics and their 
growing audience unnerve him further.

                         PITO
               Kei Riri a te raho Maroke. 
               (shouted loudly at TAHU)
               (Watch it dry balls is getting 
               touchy.)

                    SUBTITLED

STEWART nods suspiciously towards the MAORI speaker not understanding 
him, the speaker smiles and nods back.

                         STEWART
               I suggest you prepare for a 
               difficult journey. The bush 
               will tear clothes and the mud 
               is deep in places.


STEWART walks away. ADA stands beside the piano turned away from the 
activities. FLORA pats her hand trying to cheer her. Down on the beach 
a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking. Some of the young 
men are racing naked into the sea.

                         STEWART
               (to BAINES about the MAORIS) 
               What are they doing? We don't 
               have time for that.

Sc 17     EXI     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 17

It is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make 
their way up into the bush. ADA still stands beside her piano. FLORA 
wants to follow the party. BAINES comes back along the beach, trailed 
by a young Maori boy, KAHA.

                         BAINES
               Mr. Stewart asked if I might 
               show you to the path. (ADA does 
               not move) ... May I carry 
               something?

ADA turns to BAINES, her face angry and defiant, her eyes full of 
tears. BAINES falls back, struck by her show of emotion. ADA and FLORA 
walk past him toward the bush.

Sc 18     EXT     CLIFF ABOVE BEACH               DAY     Sc 18

The party threads its way through the bush along the cliff. ADA pauses 
at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand, tiny and 
desolate. Its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her. Its 
music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene.

Sc 19     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     Sc 19

Brown feet squelch through the mud, finally followed by dainty boots 
caked in dirt. The MAORI leaders of the party have stopped.

BAINES works his way to the front.

STEWART struggles up to the front to join BAINES, he speaks over the 
top of HONE.

                         STEWART
               What's he say?

                         BAINES
               Someone died here. It's tapu.

                         STEWART
               But we came down this way 
               didn't we? I'm sure we did.

The MAORI leaders continue discussing.

STEWART continues over the top of the MAORI discussion.

                         STEWART
               They want more money. They are 
               trying to make two days out of 
               it?

                         BAINES
               No, no they know another track 
               - to the side of this.

ADA and FLORA sit watching, out of breath. The bush is dense, 
claustrophobic and exotic. One of the MAORI women sits close to ADA 
apparently not looking at her- Slowly she draws the scarf that is in 
ADA's lap into her own. Defiantly she puts it on.

Meanwhile another woman makes a very dignified attempt to wipe the 
freckles from FLORA's face.

It is another day and STEWART'S hut, bleakly set amidst smoking stumps 
is full of squeals, chasing and antics.

Sc 21     INT     STEWART'S HUT               DAY     Sc 21

The reverend in frock coat has a wedding dress stuck part way up his 
arms. It is not a normal wedding dress but a backless one used again 
and again as a photographic prop. Stewart's AUNT MORAG and her 
companion NESSIE are trying to pull it off.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Watch your feet!

                         NESSIE
               Watch your feet!

ADA and FLORA find the family fun frightening and have taken refuge in 
the bedroom.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Careful! Watch his hand.

                         NESSIE
               Watch his hand

The REVEREND tickles his sister as she tries to get the sleeve off his 
hand. NESSIE squeals with excitement.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Stop it!

NESSIE looks towards ADA panting with excitement at the fun.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (shooing the Reverend out) 
               We'll bring out the bride.

The two women now fit the wedding dress on ADA.

                         AUNT MORAG
               LIFT - YOUR - ARM - UP - DEAR.

FLORA sits on the bed sulkily. She leans back and crosses her leg.

                         FLORA
               My REAL father was a famous 
               German composer

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohh the tag is broken.

                         FLORA
               (continues) .... They met when 
               my mother was an opera 
               singer... in Luxemburg...

The two women pause to look at FLORA. ADA signs to FLORA "THAT'S 
ENOUGH!"

                         FLORA
               Why?

ADA looks away, the two women finish primping the dress. FLORA crosses 
her arms.

                         FLORA
               I want to be in the photograph.

Sc 22     EXT     STEWART'S Hut                DAY     Sc 22

NESSIE half holds an umbrella over ADA as they make their way to where 
the camera is setup in front of a chair and a sparse display of three 
toi-toi. All about the house is muddy, so much so that they must weave 
their way through on planks and logs. A fine veil of rain is falling 
across the distant bush, the whole valley is shrouded in mist. STEWART 
looks through the camera at the REVEREND and the photographer who are 
posing as the couple, complete with tatty bouquet. STEWART notices 
ADA's arrival and seeing her as a real bride, his bride, he is 
struckdumb with pride, even the rough tapes at the back or the dress 
cannot destroy the illusion.

                         STEWART
               Beautiful.

The umbrellas are held away, the rain pours down.

Sc 23     INT/EXT     STEWARTS HUT BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 23

AUNT MORAG has brought a chair into the bedroom and sits knee to knee 
with FLORA.

                         AUNT MORAG
               I thought she met your father 
               in Luxemburg.

                         FLORA
               Well, yes, in Austria where be 
               conducted the Royal Orchestra. 

                         AUNT MORAG
               (frowning) And where did they 
               get married?

AUNT MORAG checks to see if someone is coming.

                         FLORA
               (her Scottish accent becomes 
               thick and expressive) In an 
               enormous forest, with real 
               fairies as bridesmaids each 
               holding a little elf's hand.

AUNT MORAG sits back, regarding FLORA with obvious disapproval and 
disappointment. She smooths back her hair.

                         FLORA
               No, I tell a lie, it was in a 
               small country church, near the 
               mountains

AUNT MORAG is becoming involved again. She leans forward.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Which mountains are those dear?

                         FLORA
               The Alps.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohhh I've never been there. 
               (she leans forward)

                         FLORA
               Mother used to sing the songs 
               in German and her voice would 
               echo across the valleys

               That was before the 
               accident....

                         AUNT MORAG
               Oh what happened?

MORAG looks over her shoulder as FLORA continues to talk, so 
persuasive is FLORA's storytelling that the scene comes vividly to 
life, albeit in FLORA's dark pupil.

                         FLORA
               One day when my mother and 
               father were singing together in 
               the forest, a great storm blew 
               up out of nowhere. But so 
               passionate was their singing 
               that they did not notice, nor 
               did they stop as the rain began 
               to fall and when their voices 
               rose for the final bars of the 
               duet a great bolt of lightening 
               came out of the sky and struck 
               my father so that he lit up 
               like a torch... And at the same 
               moment my father was struck 
               dead my mother was struck dumb! 
               She- never-spoke-another-word.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohhh ... dear. Not another word    
               From the shock, yes it would 
               be.

The story is interrupted by the return of the wedding party who are 
dripping wet, exactly as the couple in the story. AUNT MORAG bustles 
over to take off the wet wedding gown, her face puckered with tragedy.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Terrible.  Terrible

Before she can undo the ties ADA pulls it from herself so aggressively 
that the ties and part of the gown comes apart. None of this is a 
concern to ADA who is distracted with fear for her piano. She crosses 
to the little window and stares anxiously at the falling rain.

Soft piano music has been playing over the previous scene. Now it 
builds to strength as sea water swirls high around the piano, small 
and embattled on the dark rainy beach.

Sc 23     INT     STEWART'S HUT BEDROOM          DAY     Sc 25

It's morning of the next day. ADA and FLORA sit amongst tea chests in 
the bedroom. ADA is signing intently to FLORA. FLORA signs back, 
sometimes using words. STEWART watches uneasy with their secret 
communication. As STEWART enters the animation is suspended. ADA 
stands and takes a step back as if to attention.

                         STEWART
               I shall be gone for some days. 
               There is some Maori land I want 
               and may buy very reasonably.

               you will use the time to settle 
               in, and, in some ways we may 
               start again

FLORA and ADA look at each other.

                         STEWART
               All right?

ADA looks at him blankly, then nods.

ADA and FLORA dressed in cloaks and bonnets skirt the dense bush 
trying to find a path in. It is not easy, because the bush is so 
tight. ADA's leg slides in up to her calf in mud.

ADA and FLORA arrive at BAINES' rough hut. It is mid-morning but 
BAINES is not yet dressed. ADA hands him a note. BAINES looks at it 
blankly.

                         BAINES
               I'm not able to read.

ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               Please take us to the beach 
               where we landed.

                         BAINES
               I'm sorry, I can't do that. 
               (FLORA and ADA stare evenly at 
               him) 
               I don't have the time.
               (They continue to stare.)
               Goodbye

It is much later when BAINES emerges from his hut with a saddle over 
his arm. The two women are still there. ADA looks up at him 
expectantly.

FLORA mirrors her expression.

                         BAINES
               I - can't - take - you there. I 
               can't do it.

He puts the saddle over a rail. He continues to saddle up, sneaking 
glances at them from under the horse and around its side. They watch 
him closely, not pleadingly, but stubbornly1 eerily of one mind.

The sky is blue with long wisps of cloud.

The party of three break onto the long expanse of beach where the 
piano still stands. It has not been without visitors. There are 
footprints on the sand and some of the boards have been pulled back. 
ADA passes BAINES, walking urgently towards it. Soon, ADA has removed 
enough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys. EMNES stays 
back. ADA takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys 
again. Her whole composition is altered. She is animated, joyful, 
excited.

Down on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention 
using a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the 
sand.

BAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the 
spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His 
attention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he 
watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer.

Sc 30     EXT     BEACH                    LATE AFTER NOONSc 30

The shadows are long on the sand when BAIN'ES collects the boards. ADA 
and FLORA are attempting a duet. ADA notices him come towards them 
with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood 
darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has 
stopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape 
and bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her 
mesmerised as he replaces the boards.

The hut puffs smoke out into the valley. The lie of the land traps 
sound like a shell and the clear high notes of a voice echo out. 
Suspicious that ADA is singing, STEWART approaches the house quietly. 
Through the open kitchen door he sees that the keys of a piano have 
been etched on the table top. While ADA "plays" the notes FLORA sings 
them.

STEWART puts his pack down. ADA stands to attention, folding the 
tablecloth back over the table.

                         STEWART

               Hello.


ADA nods. STEWART'S hand explores the markings on the table. ADA 
watches his hand moving under the checked cloth.

Sc 34     INT     MISSION HOUSE               DAY     Sc 34

AUNT MORAG, NESSIE and TWO MAORI GIRLS dressed in proper Victorian 
costume are kneeling around a huge double white sheet, sewing and 
cutting it. The MAORI girls are part of the mission's good works. They 
are dressed in European style and while their training is in polite 
proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their 
demonstrative displays of affection, and their clay tobacco pipes to 
which they are addicted.

STEWART is standing, looking on. BAINES is behind him in the kitchen 
removing his boots.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (looking carefully at STEWART) 
               Well you stopped combing your 
               hair, which is a good thing, it 
               was looking over done. 
               (without pause but referring to 
               the sheet) You see these are 
               the slits that the heads will 
               go through, show him Nessie ... 
               they'll be dead, the Reverend 
               is going to use animal blood, 
               no doubt it will be very 
               dramatic. Tea! 
               (for NESSIE rather than to her)

                         NESSIE
               It will be very dramatic.


NESSIE leaves to get the tea. HENI, the MAORI girl with a Moku tickles 
MARI'S back while she sews.

They sing the anthem in snatches. It is background to the 
conversation.

                         STEWART
               (sitting down) 
               What would you think if someone 
               played a kitchen table like it 
               were a piano?

                         AUNT MORAG
               Like it were a piano?

                         STEWART
               It's strange isn't it? I mean 
               it's not a piano, it doesn't 
               make any sound.

NESSIB puts STEWART'S tea down. BAINES comes in with his tea cup 
dwarfed in his big hands. He stands back leaning against a wall.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (hissing to NESSIE) Biscuits.' 
               No, no sound.

NESSIE hustles back to the kitchen.

                         STEWART
               I knew she was mute, but now 
               I'm thinking it's more than 
               that. I'm wondering if she's 
               not brain affected.

                         AUNT MORAG
               No sound at all?

                         STEWART
               No, it was a table.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (musing) Well, she was very 
               violent with the gown. She tore 
               off a chunk of lace. if hadn't 
               been there I'd have sworn she'd 
               used her teeth

                         NESSIE
               and wiped her feet an it.

                         STEWART
               Well it has not yet come to 
               anything. Just a concern.

AUNT MORAG pats her chest. a calming device.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Oh, yes, yes of course, a 
               concern.

                         STEWART
               There is something to be said 
               for silence

                         AUNT MORAG
               Oh indeed. Cotton'.

She holds her needle up for NESSIE to thread.

                         STEWART
               (warming)  And with time she 
               will, I'm sure, become 
               affectionate.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Certainly, there is nothing so 
               easy to like as a pet and they 
               are quite silent.

BAINES watches quietly on.

Sc 35     EXT     STEWART'S WOODCHOP          DAY     Sc 35

STEWART is at the woodshop cutting firewood. He displays his 
virtuosity as an axeman, cutting the wood into ever more slender 
pieces, FLORA is watching and stacking the fallen timber. She flinches 
as the axe hits the wood, but scurries in to pick up the timber. 
BAINES is standing talking to STEWART.

                         BAINES
               Those 80 acres, that cross the 
               stream, what do you think of 
               them?

                         STEWART
               On your property?

                         BAINES
               Yes

BAINES carries a log across for STEWART who talks without pausing in 
his work,

                         STEWART
               Good, flatish land with 
               reliable water, why? I don't 
               have money. What are you about?

                         BAINES
               I'd like to make a swap.

                         STEWART
               What for?

                         BAINES
               The piano.

                         STEWART
               The piano on the beach? Ada's 
               piano?

BAINES nods. STEWART stops, this is serious.

                         STEWART
               It's not marshy is it?

STEWART has walked a few paces away from his wood chop in the 
direction of the land.

                         BAINES
               No.


                         STEWART
               You'd have to organise it up 
               here.

                         BAINES
               Yes, I thought that.

                         STEWART
               Well Baines the music lover, I 
               never would have known. Hidden 
               talents George.

                         BAINES
               I'll have to get lessons. It 
               wouldn't be much use without 
               them.

                         STEWART
               Yes, I suppose you would.

BAINES remains silent. He looks away.

                         STEWART
               Well Ada can play.

BAINES shrugs.

                         STEWART
               I have it in a letter she plays 
               well. She's been playing since 
               she was 5 or6.

FLORA has stopped stacking. She is lying along the top of the wood, 
lifting a leg up and down, watching the men.

STEWART, flushed with his plans, is pouring tea into cups. FLORA peers 
at cup level through the steam. ADA sits beside her at the table.

                         STEWART
               I have got us some excellent 
               land. Baines has taken some 
               queer idea to have a piano, and 
               you are to give him lessons. 
               Have you taught before?

ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               What on?

                         STEWART
               On your piano, that is the 
               swap.

ALA finger signs, her face furious.

                         STEWART
               What does she say?

                         FLORA
               She says it's her piano, and 
               she won't have him touch it. 
               He's an oaf, he can't read, 
               he's ignorant.

                         STEWART
               He wants to improve himself... 
               and you will be able to play on 
               it ... (ADA is not responding 
               well) Teach him to look after 
               it.

ADA's breathing becomes heavy with anger, she writes Curiously on her 
pad.

               NO! NO! THE PIANO IS MINE! IT'S 
               MINE!

STEWART regards her note and her passion with suspicion and disdain

                         STEWART
               (getting up) You can't go on 
               like this, we are a family now, 
               all of us make sacrifices and 
               so will you.
               You will teach him. I shall see 
               to that!

ADA's emotions are suddenly removed and she views STEWART blankly, 
eerily so.

Sc 37     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     SC 37

The piano is taken up through the bush by a group of six to eight 
MAORI MEN. It's very heavy and awkward and they grunt and struggle 
with it.

               You lick it.)

Someone stumbles and the back of the piano comes crashing to the 
ground thundering out in the bottom end of the scale. People scatter. 
Only one stays who warrior like challenges the piano.

The women duck low to avoid a branch as STEWART leads them to BAINE'S

strange, bearded forest where the tops of trees are bare and ghost 
like.

                         STEWART
               I'd try children's tunes, 
               nothing more complicated

ADA is unrepentant, she does not want to teach BAINES the piano.

                         STEWART
               Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good.

               (lifting the lid) It looks 
               good, very nice looking thing. 
               Well . I wish you luck. The girls 
               are very excited about the 
               lessons.

The "girls" look anything but excited. FLORA shy, plays obsessively 
with a long strand of greasy hair. ADA is cold and grim.

                         STEWART
               Flora will explain anything Ada says.
               They talk through their fingers, 
               you can't believe what they say 
               with just their hands.

STEWART leaves. BAJNES goes to the piano and lifts the lid. He looks 
at them. ADA signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               My mother wants to see your 
               hands. Hold them out.

BAINES holds out his hands, spread wide as if holding a ball.

               No, no, like this

FLORA puts her neat little fingers together, first with their backs up 
then she turns them over. HAINES does the same only his bands are big 
and coarse. ADA signs to FLORA. BAINES is shyly keen.

                         FLORA
               You have to wash them.

                         BAINES
               They are washed.

ADA signs.

                         FLORA

               The marks do not come out.  
               They are scars and hardened 
               skin.

ADA and FLORA do not move. Humiliated BAINES takes a scrub brush, soap 
and bucket and goes outside. ADA can see him from the window. She 
moves to her piano. She wants to touch it but she is torn by her 
feelings, wanting it, but not owning it. She strokes the varnished 
wood with her hand and softly lifts the lid. Outside FLORA stands 
beside BAINES pointing out hits of his hand he should still scrub. 
Furtively she lays her hands on the keys. The instrument is horribly 
out of tune, almost every note is off. She goes outside and signs to 
FLORA.

                         FLORA
               There's no tune left in the 
               piano so she can't teach you.

The two women leave.

fall by grasping hold of branches and shoots. Finally their fall is 
checked. The old man is white haired, the front of his suit splattered 
with the debris of many meals. He sits up feeling about for his

               Ah, a Broadbent. A fine 
               instrument. I've not come 
               across one here, or in the 
               Islands where I have tuned some 
               200. Yes, they like their 
               pianos there.

Out of his pocket he takes a carefully wrapped tuning fork. He unwraps 
the package, lifts the back and lid and starts to tune. He sniffs the 
air. BAINES watches, He sniffs close to the keys.

               Scent? And salt of course.

He works on.

               What will you play when it's 
               tuned? What music do you play?

BAINS looks over at him from the meal he is preparing.

                         BAINES
               I can't play.

The blind man stops working.

               I'm going to learn.

The man goes back to work somewhat depressed by the futility of the 
venture.

A slash of sunlight falls across the piano. Thousands of particles of 
dust become visible floating in the air. BAINES is at the window in 
his shirt/night shirt. He notices the dust on the piano and strips off 
his shirt which he uses as a duster. Under the shirt he is naked. As 
he wipes the smooth wood he becomes aware of his nakedness. His 
movements become slower until he is no longer cleaning, but caressing 
the piano.

On the path to BAINES' house, ADA and FLORA sit in the bush. ADA's 
head is bowed. Her hands held over her face. FLORA tries to catch the 
spots of light in her palm as they twinkle through the thick canopy of 
leaves over head.

The door opens. ADA and FLORA stand in their cloaks and bonnets.

                         FLORA
               Mother says she can't stand to 
               teach piano with it all out or 
               tune. So I'm to do scales.

ADA turns and walks off. FLORA bustles in. BAINES watches ADA from the 
window,

                         FLORA
               I hope you've scrubbed your 
               hands.

FLORA begins a scale.

               Oh, it's in tune.

She looks over at BAINES who is still gazing out the window.

                         FLORA
               What's out there?

She gets up to see what BAINES is looking at. She sees her mother and 
divines BAINES is looking at nothing.

                         FLORA
               You have to watch me where I 
               put my fingers.

FLORA starts again. ADA can only hear the piano faintly but moves 
closer as she too hears it's in tune.

As she enters the hut BAINES pulls his fingers away from the piano. 
FLORA sees this and stops too. She looks at her mother.

                         FLORA
               It's in tune.

ADA checks the other notes. FLORA stands with her arms folded, a bit 
sulky and fluffed up.

                         FLORA
               (Hissing) I was teaching.

ADA tries the piano. She looks over at BAINES then signs to FLORA.

                         FLORA
               She wants to see what you can 
               do.

                         BAINES
               I'd rather not play. I want to 
               listen and learn that way.

                         FLORA
               Everyone has to practice.

                         BAINES
               I just want to listen.

ADA is a bit nonplussed. She does not want to be listened to anymore 
than she wants to teach. She pulls a strand of her hair then signs to 
FLORA.

                         FLORA
               What do you want to hear?

BAIWES shrugs shyly and locks away out the window. He doesn't know

                         BAINES
               Anything.

ADA is slow to start. Unobliging as ever she plays scales. But once 
begun her belligerence fades as her absorption in the music 
strengthens.


Sc 49     INT     STEWART'S HUT/ADA'S BEDROOM      NIGHT     Sc 49 

Back at STEWART'S hut, ADA lies dispirited on the bed. FLORA lies 
beside her holding ADA's hand.

                         FLORA
               Tell me about my real father.

ADA nods and strokes FLORA's hair from her face. FLORA leans back.

               How did you speak to him?

ADA signs to FLORA who watches in love with all the stories of her 
mother and unreal father.

                         ADA (subtitled)
               I didn't need to speak, I could 
               lay thoughts out in his mind 
               like they were a sheet

                         FLORA
               What happened? Why didn't you 
               get married?

ADA continues to sign her hands casting odd animal like shadows on the 
newspapered walls.

                         ADA cont.
               After a while he became 
               frightened and he stopped 
               listening.


STEWART enters their bedroom. FLORA stops and ADA stands against the 
wall. STEWART finds the atmosphere curious yet impenetrate.

                         STEWART
               Shall I kiss you goodnight?

FLORA looks up at her mother. ADA shrugs.

STEWART nods stiffly, and uncomfortably, he leaves.

It's raining heavily, FLORA sits on the small verandah outside BAINES' 
hut, her legs stuck straight out into the wet. She is overseeing a 
merciless power game with the dog, forcing it out of the verandah with 
a stick.

Sc 51     INT     BAINE'S HUT                    DAY     Sc 51

ADA's playing can be heard inside. BAINES sits back watching ADA. Her 
cape on the hook is dripping a puddle on to the floor and there is a 
circle of drips around her skirt hem. She is totally absorbed in her 
piano music as she was on the beach.

BAINES watches. Her long white neck, now wet from rain, proves 
irresistible. He comes across the room and kisses her. ADA jumps up 
and prepares to leave. BAINES stands in front of the door.

                         BAINES
               Do you know how to bargain, nod 
               if you do.

She doesn't move,

               There's a way you can have your 
               piano back. Do you want it 
               back? You want it back?

ADA eyes him suspiciously.

                         BAINES
               You see I'd like us to make a 
               deal. There's things I want to 
               do while you stay. If you let 
               me you can earn it back.

               What do you think, one visit 
               for every key.

ADA is tense but she is thinking about it. She holds up a finger then 
points to the black of her dress.

                         BAINES
               Your dress?

ADA shakes her head.

               Skirt ...?

She walks over to her piano and points to a black key. 

               For every black one?

ADA turns raising her head, nodding. 

               That's a lot less, half.

BAINES is counting the keys. ADA starts for the front door. 

               All right, all right then, the 
               black keys.

She sits back at the piano. She plays the lowest black key as in 
number one

She takes her hands off the piano waiting.

               It's better that you play.

Obediently she begins, stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches 
her neck.

                         BAINES
               Play... Keep playing.

After a moment she settles back to the piano.

BAINES bathes in a riverhole. He is watched by a gathering of Maori, 
sometimes with great seriousness, at other times with hilarity. They 
pass between them his clothes, trying them on and mimicking him. One 
of the older women HIRA crouches close to the bank keeping up a steady 
line of inquiry. Her manner is relaxed but focused and persistent. She 
smokes a pipe-

                         HIRA
               I got the good wife for you 
               Peini. She pray good. Clean.

               No, no bible readers.

BAINES continues good humouredly washing.

               where she?

               She lives her own life in New 
               Jersey, America.

               You get rnana for that. Our

BAINES shakes his head amusedly. As he gets out of the river HIRA 
slaps him.

               I marry white man Peini, he a 
               whaler like you. He very good 
               to me. Love me, nurse me.

HIRA touches her own face where BAINES' tattoo is.

               Who do that? It not finish, 
               that no good Peini. You finish!

Several people on the bank are taking turns to comb their hair, 
peering into a tiny piece of mirror.

BAINES' dog hears ADA and FLORA approach. It takes off under the 
house. FLORA calls the dog. It keeps well hidden. ADA has gone on 
inside and the door is closed. FLORA stands outside the door left out 
and lonely. She knocks. BAINES answers.

                         FLORA

               I want to speak to my mother

She buries her head in her mother's skirt.

               I don't want to be outside, I 
               want to watch. 

ADA signs to FLORA.

               I'll be very quiet.

ADA leads her to the door signing to her

               I won't look at him!

FLORA is shut out.

ADA sits at the piano. She is shy and nervous She turns to BAINES who 
nods. ADA begins to play. BAINIES keeps his head bowed, but as the 
playing becomes more confident he raises his head to watch.  He sits 
at a far corner of the room apparently enjoying the whole vision or 
this woman at her piano.

After some time BAINES, affected by the music, takes his chair to a 
closer position and from an opposite angle. ADA glances up as she 
feels him passing behind her.  He seems satisfied to watch. His 
attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to 
the piano.

Again he shifts his chair, taking it round the back and to the other 
side of the piano. As he moves ADA watches warily. From this position 
be doesn't try to touch her, but watches, enjoying her fingers moving 
on the keys and the small details of motion on her face. Twice he 
closes his eyes and breathes deeply BAINES is experiencing an 
unpractised sense of appreciation and lust. When his eyes are closed, 
ADA glances at him with curiosity and suspicion.

FLORA stands on a kitchen chair. AUNT MORAG and NESSIE have paused 
from fitting FLORA's bodice and wire angel wings. They are attempting 
to learn the hand gestures as FLORA signs:

               "I shall listen hard to rehearsal, 
               because I live too 
               far away to go often."

                         AUNT MORAG
               (suspiciously) Which sign is 
               the word rehearsal?

FLORA deftly demonstrates.

                         AUNT MORAG
               I can't imagine a fate worse 
               than being dumb. Turn around.

               Actually, to tell you the whole 
               truth, Mama says most people 
               speak rubbish and it's not 
               worth the listen.

AUNT MORAG and NESSIE exchange looks.

               (stiffly) Well, that is a 
               strong opinion.

ADA is quick to remove a used plate and cup left on top of the piano.

BAINES is sitting next to the window, his elbow on the sill, his head 
turned away.

                         BAINES
               Lift your skirt,

ADA stops playing. She turns to him. Thinks about it then slowly lifts 
her skirt a little to show her boots.

               Lift it higher.

ADA pulls the skirt up fractionally so the top other boots are 
exposed.

BAINIES nods ADA starts to play again, not so confidently as before.

BAINES moves close, he goes down on his knees to watch her feet on the 
pedals.

                         BAINES
               Higher.

ADA doesn't hear.

               Lift it higher.

She stops and lifts her skirt to her knees. She looks at BAINES with 
ill-disguised contempt. BAINES is enthralled with her legs, or what he 
can now see of them. He moves back to watch them from behind. He's 
lying on the ground, head propped on his arm. ADA's slim stockinged 
calves work the pedals, one of the stockings has a small hole through 
which her white skins shows

NESSIE as he cuts out the shape of an axe from a piece of marbled 
cardboard. A lamplight flickers warm tones across their faces while 
the rest of the room is dark giving it a conspiratorial air.

The REVEREND points to the opposite rose-papered wall, where his 
shadow and paper axe now look very real as they loom large above the

denoting lesson four.

               Undo your dress. This part, 
               (he indicates the top) I want 
               to see your arms.

ADA is taken unawares. She sits a moment unsure if she wants to 
cooperate, then slowly she staffs to undo her buttons.

ADA pulls her arms out of the tight sleeves. Underneath she wears a 
worn-in bodice. Her arms are so white they seem transparent. A 
delicate network of blue-green veins crisscross up the soft underpart 
of her arms. A dark growth of hair in her armpit suggests a shadowy 
depth. The back of her hands, normally white, are quite tanned in 
comparison.

                         BAINES
               Play.

BAINES draws his chair close. Gently he places his hand on the soft 
underpart of her forearm. ADA stiffens and pulls away. He grips the 
arm.

               Two keys.

ADA continues to play. Slowly he moves his hand higher towards her 
shoulder. Clearly unnerved she changes the music to something brisk, 
almost comical. BAINES feels suddenly ridiculous, his mood broken. He 
takes his hand away and moves back to the window injured. ADA is 
victorious, she is pleased to have won herself a respite.

way through the fallen logs to BAINES path.

                         STEWART
               Wait.

The two women stop. There is a Japanese sense of deferment to STEWART

                         STEWART

               That is good, yes.

As ADA walks on AUNT MORAG leans towards STEWART.

               She seems quieted down.  Is she 
               more affectionate?

STEWART looks after them unable to answer.

BAINES secures a chair against the door while ADA is removing her 
dress top. She sits at the piano hugging herself against the chill.  
As BAINES passes be knocks the jacket off the chair back. He picks it 
up and takes it across to her seat by the window.

BAINES nods and ADA begins to play. BAINES fingers the still warm 
jacket1 he lifts it up and smells it. ADA turns around and stops 
playing suddenly appalled by his odd sensual pleasure taking. She 
holds out her hand for the jacket, her expression stern and 
censorious. She indicates he should return it to the chair back. 
BAINES ignores her. ADA stands and comes over to BAINES. She pulls the 
jacket from his hands and replaces it across the chair back, but as 
she turns to sit,

BAINES is beside her. He pulls the shoulders of her bodice down, 
exposing her shoulders and some of her breast. ADA immediately stands, 
but BMNES is much stronger and man-handles her across to the bed. ADA 
struggles seriously, this is much, much more than she was expecting.

ADA holds up five fingers and mouths 'five'.

               I just want to lie.

ADA shakes her head vigorously and again mouths five'. 

               All right, all right five.

ADA no longer struggles. She is stiff and still. BAINES intoxicated by 
the smell and presence of her skin becomes soft and gentle. He kisses 
and touches her with feeling and affection. Then suddenly aware of her 
stillness he too becomes still. He pulls himself up to see whether her 
face betrays her feelings. ADA seizes this opportunity to return to 
the uncertain sanctuary of her piano. From the bed, BAINES watches her 
run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture 
betraying affection never afforded to him. BAINES gets up. He shuts 
the piano lid forcing ADA to remove her hand.

ADA immediately stands and dresses, marking hurtfully BAINES' 
ownership of her piano.

A golden evening. STEWART in his best shirt and trousers prepares the 
horse and cart.

Inside FLORA is in her finished Angel costume, she sings softly to 
herself while ADA undoes the long strands of plaits and separates them 
to comb.

                         FLORA
               The Holly and the Ivy...

STEWART comes in to put on his jacket, but the collar is all tucked 
in. ADA automatically adjusts it for him, settling it around his neck. 
Her touch, meant practically, strangely affects him. In an impassioned 
impasse, meant gallantly, he tries to kiss ADA's finger tips. The 
gesture falters as ADA, surprised, jumps back.

Some people are already seated in the hall. Several other angels have 
arrived, and they like FLORA are ushered backstage.

Sc 67     INT     SCHOOL HALL BACKSTAGE          NIGHT     Sc 67
BACKSTAGE, the Sunday School teacher is gathering the children 
together, reminding them of the order of songs, checking their hair, 
etc. The local dramatic society are also preparing themselves. One of 
the women is peeping through a hole in a make-shift curtain to watch 
the townspeople seating themselves.

                         WOMAN
               They're bringing in extra 
               seats!

Despite this, there would still be only a maximum of forty people. 10 
or so of them MAORIS in their best European dress.

                         ANOTHER WOMAN
               Oh God, don't pin my hair too

               Yes, me too, do it about here 
               ... (she shows Alfred)

Two of the women are putting a little c4ouring on each of the angels 
while two other angels are being smacked for putting their white gloved 
hands in the bucket of blood.

Sc 68     INT     SCHOOL HALL                    NIGHT     Sc 68

Everyone is chatting at each other's seats, except the MAOIRI guests 
who wait solemnly. AUNT MORAG is organising the placement of the new 
seats. BAINES arrives.

                         MAN ONE
               Look who's here, the musical MR BAINES
               What will we have tonight 
               George, "Twinkle, twinkle?"

BAINES smiles and blinks, the teasing continues as BAINES scans the 
room for ADA. Two of the MAORI PARTY share one pair of shoes so that 
only one may be in the hall at a time, while the other waits 
barefooted outside.

                         ANOTHER MAN
               'Mary had a little lamb' or a 
               polka, come on George what's it 
               to be?

AUNT MORAG hustles over to BAINIES and pushes him in front of her 
towards NESSIE and the piano.


                         AUNT MORAG
               Mr. Baines, do come and turn 
               pages

BAINES looks wildly about for rescue.

                         BAINES
               I can't read music, I have just 
               begun.

BAINES backs off from NESSIE whose face drops in disappointment. He 
has spotted ADA and is eager to take a seat near her. He takes the 
seat next to ADA but one. He sits smiling and blinking. The teasing 
continues, behind him.

                         STEWART
               (turning) Lot of fools. Come 
               on, move up.

ADA puts her hand on the seat and shakes her head indicating that she 
is saving it for FLORA. BAINES is rebuffed and looks across at ADA who 
ignores him.

The main lights are put out and everyone returns to their places. In 
the dark STEWART shyly takes ADA's hand in his. BAINES watches STEWART 
squeezing her hand and quite out of control stands and leaves 
accompanied by a chorus of eshhhhhhhhhhhhhn. Satisfied, ADA watches 
him go.

The children file on with their candles, They stand in a group singing 
with great seriousness, but struck with shyness their voices are so 
small as barely to be heard.

               -sing up Billy!
               -Come on sing out!

One of the smallest promptly pees. An arm reaches under the curtain to 
wipe the stage.

Sc 69     INT     SCHOOL RALL & BACK STAGE     NIGHT     Sc 69

Backstage all is ready for the main dramatic event. There seems to be 
more peep-holes than curtains as eyes press themselves to the little 
flap. The master of ceremonies, the REVEREND is on stage explaining 
the dramatics. He is wearing harlequin tights and rompers, his face is 
dramatically paled. The candles are blown out.

                         REVEREND
               And so the young maid came upon 
               each and all of Bluebeard's 
               missing wives, their severed 
               heads still bleeding, their 
               eyes still crying.

The piano accompaniment is suspenseful while the audience shriek 
appreciatively. Backstage AUNT MORAG provides the dripping blood, 
moving between the corpses, she peers at the audience through a peep-
hole in the curtain.

                         REVEREND
               But who it this? 

(AUNT MORAG looks around gasping, fooled despite herself)

A loud improvised door slam and heavy footsteps. NESSIE, in costume, 
freezes. The shadow of Bluebeard moves clumsily down the cut-out 
banister and along the corridor.

                         BLUEBEARD
               I am home early my sweet wife 
               ... where art thou?

The girl scrambles for the fallen key and rushes out of the closet 
into the silhouette corridor.

                         YOUNG WIFE
               Hello husband, what a surprise!

                         BLUEBEARD
               Yes wife, a surprise indeed! So 
               now you know my secret you, the 
               sweetest and youngest or all my 
               wives must be prepared to die.

BLUEBEARD pulls out a cut-out axe and moves towards her.

Two of the young warriors in CHIEF NIHE's party rise to their feet.

               Auc! Ha aba ra tenei?

                    SUBTITLED

NIHE waves them down, but they are shaken up and only crouch above 
their seats. The others stare anxiously between NIHE and the stage.

                         NIHE
               (Amused by them)

BLUEBEARD moves closer, the young wife drops to her knees her hands 
held up in prayer.

                         YOUNG WIFE
               No, no wait!

                         BLUEBEARD
               I shall not wait. Bare your 
               neck.

As BLUEBEARD raises his axe again, first one then the other of the 
young warriors run forward, shouting a fierce war cry and parting the 
audience, who flee to either side while the corpses come very much to 
life.

               Kia hiwara! Kin hiwara! 
               (Be on the alert! Brace

Only NIHE and his top-hatted daughter remain calmly in their seats. 
The warriors have BLUEBEARD cornered and whimpering an umbrella held 
spear-like above him. NIHE stomps his stick, his great voice booming 
out.

Sc 71     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 71

ADA goes to the piano, she is upset that BAINES has again left a plate 
on top of it. BAINES intercepts her, stepping several times between 
her and the piano. She sees the game and stands still. He steps aside. 
She removes the plate, gently, lovingly wiping the surface underneath. 
There is a sulky irritation in the ways BAINES watches her.

                         BAINES
               I have been waiting. You are 
               very late.

ADA starts to play, BAINES watches then looks away.

                         BAINES
               I don't want you to play. I 
               just want you to sit.

ADA keeps playing until she has finished. Without looking at him she 
holds up two fingers against the piano.

                         BAINES
               (angry) No, not two keys.

ADA starts playing again, BAINES feels powerless. He no longer admires 
her absorption with the piano, he is jealous of it.

                         BAINES
               (shouts) Two keys then!

She stops playing. There is an insolence or casualness in the way she 
regards BAINES. He pulls her chair back from the piano. This upsets 
her, as much of her confidence was associated with the instrument. 
BAINES kisses her passionately on the mouth. ADA pulls back, BAINES 
persists, he is desperate and romantic.


Sc 72     EXT     BASE OF BUSH COVERED HILL     DAY     Sc 72 

STEWART, with BAINES interpreting, talks with a group of MAORIS at the 
base of a bush covered hill. The MAORIS sit behind a small

               the blankets for half the land.

What do they want it for? They 
don't cultivate it, burn it 
back, anything. How do they 
even know it's theirs?

BAINES stops as he comes to a freshly placed fence post. STEWART winds 
down his complaints watching BAINES anxiously. BAIXES walks down to 
the next one. he touches the freshly split post.

(tentatively) I thought I might 
as well mark it out.

ADA has cut a good sized cabbage in the vegetable patch. She throws it 
to FLORA who misses, dropping it in a pool of mud, spattering her face 
and dress. ADA smiles and FLORA who was about to cry gives the cabbage 
a big football beet towards her mother. ADA's mouth falls open, but 
then she too kicks it and they begin to dribble the mud caked cabbage 
towards the hut, all the time signing playful insults. Into this 
arrives STEWART.

                         STEWART
Baines can't play a damn thing. 
Is that right he can't play a 
thing?

We're going to lose that land, 
the way he was carrying on over 
it.

Is he musical? You've got to 
teach him a song. Something 
simple.

FLORA has her foot on the cabbage, she nudges it off behind her. It 
roll down the hill. STEWART can't help but notice,

                         STEWART
What's that?

He follows the cabbage down the hill' where he scrapes some of the mud 
off.

This thing's been knocked to 
pieces.

FLORA is seen through BAINES' window Inside, ADA as ever charts her 
progress on the black keys, eleven. She turns to BAINES for 
instructions.  BAINES is not himself, he is sulky and distant.

                         BAINES
Do what you like. Play what you 
like.

ADA is perplexed by this turn about of behaviour. A little 
uncertainly, she sets about her playing. After a little she too turns 
to see what BAINES is doing. He's not there. She is surprised then 
anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few 
keys to go. She starts to play again, but her anxieties prove too 
great. She stops and listens. She looks out the window, where FLORA is 
mucking about in the yard. She walks to his bedroom, listens, then 
opens the door. BAINES stands naked looking at her. ADA is taken aback

                         BAINES
I want to lie together without 
clothes on. How many would that 
be?

ADA holds up ten fingers an impossibly high number of keys.

BAINES nods.

ADA is surprised; she didn't expect him to agree. ADA checks again 
holding up her hands.

                         BAINES
Yes, ten keys.

Hesitantly, she starts to undress. She lies on her petticoat, having 
deemed the bed too dirty. BAINES lies, very still on top of her. A 
scraping sound is heard.

FLORA is outside walking on sticks and logs trying to make sure she 
never puts her foot on the ground. She looks over at the house 
suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again. She 
investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes 
in the loosely built hut. Her vision is always only parts of bodies, 
the venture is one of challenge and curiosity.

Sc 77     EXT     NATIVE PINE FOREST          DAY     Sc 77

FLORA and three small Maori children play amongst some native pines. 
Two MAORI WOMEN smoke and chat nearby. The children rub up and down 
against the tree trunks kissing and hugging them. The game has an edge 
of promiscuity to it as they exchange trunks and hug one tree as a 
group. Unseen by the children STEWART marches towards FLORA. He pulls 
her off the tree.

                         STEWART
               Never behave like that, never 
               any where. You are greatly 
               shamed and you have shamed 
               those trunks. (trees)

The MAORI WOMEN keep up an unacknowledged chant.

FLORA is tearful and sorry for herself. The job has an increased 
futility as it has begun to rain- STEWART is inspecting her penance. 
She follows STPWART about the trees.

               (sulkily) I know why Mr. Baines

                         FLORA
               She never gives him a turn.

STEWART stops and looks at her.

               She just plays whatever she 
               pleases, sometimes she doesn't 
               play at all.

STEWART continues through the trees more slowly.

                         STEWART
               And when is the next lesson?

                         FLORA

FLORA puts her bucket on her head to protect herself from the rain.

The next day is very windy, the tops of trees are thrashed by fierce 
gusts of wind and some smaller branches crash to the ground. ADA's

hut carried by six MAORI MEN, one of whom does nothing but walk beside 
it "plonking" the keys. Another group of MAORIS sit cross-legged on 
the verandah playing draughts. Panicked ADA hurries down the hill to 
the hut. FLORA follows behind.

Inside the hut, HIRA, the old woman from the bathing spot, is smoking 
her pipe. ADA enters distraught and indicates what she has seen. Her 
face is flushed and whipped by the wind. She is much more expressive 
than normal.

                         BAINES
               I am giving the piano back to 
               you. I've had enough.  The 
               arrangement is making you a 
               whore and me wretched.
               I want you to care for me, but 
               you can't.

BAINES sits down on a chair and prepares to eat, somewhat ignoring 
ADA. ADA is confused not quite believing the situation. She watches 
BAINES for some kind of confirmation.

                         HIRA
               (softly) George, can I use this 
               comb?


BAINES nods. ADA is still watching. HIRA scrapes the inside of her 
pipe with the comb.

                         BAINES
               It's yours, leave, go on go!

ADA is off balanced by the reversal of attitudes, surprised too, that 
she doesn't want to go. FLORA is fast to leave, ADA follows to 
organise and protect her piano on the journey.

As she climbs out of the small valley surrounding BAINES' hut, she 
stops and walks back to look down at BAINES and his hut, in the EXACT 
same manner that she once looked at her piano from the cliff-top above 
the beach. BAINES is throwing the scraps of his meal to his dog, he 
does not look up.

STEWART, on his way to BAINES, sees THE PIANO BEARERS and ADA way 
below him in the bush. He scrambles down a steep slope towards them.

               (stiffly from some distance) 
               Stop right there'. This isn't

The women exchange looks.

               very cunning Ada, but I've seen 
               through you, I'm not going to 
               lose the land this way. Wait

STEWART is off, pounding on down through the bush.

HIRA is sitting on the front step of BAINES' place, blocking STEWART'S 
easy access.

               George sick, he don't wanna see 
               nobody. You got Tupeka for the 
               Hira?

STEWART goes around to a side window in BAINES' bedroom. BAINES is 
sitting on the bed, but lies back as he hears STEWART coming about the 
side of the house. STEWART opens up the window.

                         STEWART
               I don't think you should have 
               given up the piano. I will make 
               sure you are properly taught, 
               with music written on to sheets 
               and...

                         BAINES
               I don't want to learn.

                         STEWART
               You don't want to learn.

                         BAINES
               No.

                         STEWART
               And what does this do to our 
               bargain? I cannot afford the 
               piano if you mean me to pay.

                         BAINES
               No, no payment. I have given it 
               back. I don't want it.

                         STEWART
               Well, I doubt I want it very 
               much myself.

                         BAINES
               It was more to your wife that I 
               gave it.

                         STEWART
               Well, thank you, I expect she 
               will appreciate it.

He closes the window.

               So that is agreed on?

BAINES nods.

HIRA has wandered stiffly into BAINES' room. She sits on the edge of 
his bed.

                         HIRA
               You make BIG mistake George. In 
               first place you should swap 
               land for wife. Now look, she 
               gone, you no land, no music

At the door of the hut STEWART is distributing buttons to the piano 
bearers. 
One squats catching them as they fall. A commotion begins as one of 
the MAORIS snatches the whole jar and runs off. Two of them give chase 
while the others insist on tobacco.

Inside the hut ADA had lifted the top of the piano and is peering in 
while playing notes to check tune and damage.

                         STEWART
               Is it all right? Aren't you 
               going to play something?
ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her 
hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over 
her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she 
removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly 
takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her 
happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.

                         FLORA
What will I play?

She looks to ADA, who looks back through her not concentrating.

                         STEWART
Play a gig.

                         FLORA
(to ADA) Do I know any gigs?

                         STEWART
Play a song then

FLORA starts a song, ADA walks past them out of the hut, STEWART 
ignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano. ADA is seen through 
the hut window wandering amidst the ghostly, blackened trunks. 
STEWART'S attention is drawn to ADA, he interrupts FLORA'S singing 
with a sudden outburst.

                         STEWART
(exasperated) Why won't she 
play it? We have it back, and 
she just wanders off!

FLORA stops to watch her mother through the window. ADA looks towards 
the house as the music stops.

                         STEWART
Keep playing!

Grimly STEWART slaps the top of the piano to FLORA's playing.

ADA continues to walk, her face dark and puzzled. She stops. Her head 
stiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction BAINES' hut. 
She peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. 
She thinks and walks on.

Sc 88     INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN     DAY     Sc 88

The next day ADA and her piano face each other across the kitchen. A 
slit of light falls across the piano highlighting it's rosey walnut 
wood. ADA's expression is critical and distant.

Taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. Her finger 
holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its 
side, a small heart, and an arrow. Putting the cloth aside she sits at 
the piano to begin playing.

She starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long 
she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she 
'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But 
once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she 
pauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks 
away. She stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand 
on the lid and one on the piano keys.

Sc 89     EXT     PATH TO BAINES'     DAY     Sc 89

ADA carrying her cape and bonnet hurries through the narrow bush path 
to BAINES' hut, FLORA has a fist of her skirt and is pulling back. ADA 
turns on FLORA and snatches the skirt out of the girl's hand. ADA 
signs to her and continues on.

                         FLORA
Why? Why can't I?

ADA signs again.

                         FLORA
(crossing her arms) I shan't 
practise and I DON'T CARE!

But ADA does not wait to listen. FLORA walks back through the bush 
muttering childish expletives to herself. STEWART and his two MAORI 
helpers come out of the bush towards her. FLORA squeals with fright.

                         STEWART
(looking up the hill) Where's 
your mother? Where has she 
gone?

FLORA pauses petulant and grumpy.

                         FLORA
               To HELL!

FLORA races off as fast as she can, enlivened by her wickedness. 
STEWART clambers back up the path. He just glimpses the distant figure 
of ADA nervously turning, her skirts flying as she hurries up the bush 
path The wind bothers the tops of the trees, setting them groaning, 
rubbing their branches against each other.

Sc 90     INT     BAINES' HUT          DAY     Sc 90

ADA enters BAINES' hut, she is breathless1 announcing her presence by 
simply being there, standing there. BAINES comes through from the 
bedroom. Seeing ADA he is aloof, suspicious and his blinking becomes 
pronounced.

                         BAINES
               So what brings you here? Did 
               you leave something? I have not 
               found anything.

ADA does not respond, finally she looks at BAINES and her look has a 
vulnerability and frankness that takes him off guard.

               Does he know something?

ADA shakes her head.

               The piano is not harmed? It 
               arrived safely? Would you like 
               to sit? I am going to sit.

ADA does not sit. She stands immobilised.  BAINES attempts to maintain 
his casual charade) he pours a tea.

He turns to her about to speak, but stops unmanned by a new fragility 
to her strength. He blinks rapidly

                         BAINES
               Ada, I am unhappy because I 
               want you, because my mind has 
               seized on you and thinks of 
               nothing else. This is how I 
               suffer, I am sick with longing. 
               I don't eat, I don't sleep. If 
               you do not want me, if you have 
               come with no feeling for me, 
               then go!

BAINES walks roughly towards the door and opens it, his softness 
turned suddenly cruel.

               Go! Go NOW! Leave!

ADA is stung by his change of tune, she takes a step towards him and 
eyes filling with tears of anger hits him hard across the face. 
BAINES' nose begins to bleed yet his face slowly lights up as if she 
has spoken words of love. ADA is flushed, shocked, the two face each 
other at this very moment of profound awareness of each other, 
profoundly equal. With each new breath, with every moment that their 
eyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and 
reconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how 
they came to wake where they did, they are standing next to each other 
and beginning to kiss each other, the lips, the cheeks, the nose. 
There is nothing practised about their tenderness, only their feelings 
and emotions guide their instincts. BAINES' face crumples with the 
exquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest. 
BAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin.

Outside STEWART surveys the hut suspiciously. BAINES' dog growls as he 
climbs on to the small verandah. Carefully STEWART peers through some 
loosely slatted boards. There are sounds inside which are worrying 
him. By standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see 
ADA and BAINES kissing, undressing

He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, 
he steps up to look again; the fatal second look, the look for 
curiosity. He watches BAINES bare-chested undressing ADA, her buttons 
burst, ADA laughs, BAINES touches her under her skirts - anywhere, he 
takes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings. STEWART 
watches, stepping down to peer lower as BAINES buries into ADA's 
skirt. He does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand. Suddenly 
he pulls his hand away and looks at it, wet with dog saliva, he wipes 
it on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised.

Sc 92     INT     BAINES' BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 92

Inside BAINES' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the 
softness, whiteness of BAINES' and ADA's bodies, The long black 
strands of ADA's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. Her 
face is flushed and her eyes are bright. BAINES rolls his face across 
her chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. Drunkenly 
they continue their sex slowly, slowly. ADA's breaths turn to low 
murmurs; these small sounds are extraordinarily moving to BAINES whose 
face swoons with joy.

                         BAINES
               What?  What?  whisper....

As ADA dresses, BAINES sits on his bed watching. He is unhappy, 
thoughtful.

                         BAINES
               Now you are going I am 
               miserable, why is that? (He 
               catches her hand and draws her 
               to hint) Ada I need to know, 
               what will you do? Will you come 
               again?

ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at 
the time past, worried to dress and return.

The camera cranes down and down to find STEWART wedged under the loose 
wooden floor slats. He cannot hear clearly, but ADA's hand reaching 
for each button is only inches away. One falls through a slat on to 
STEWART'S neck and on down his shirt collar. As she stands he rolls 
out.

                         BAINES
               Wait! I don't know what you're 
               thinking. (gently, teasingly) 
               Does this mean something to 
               you? Hey? (Stroking a strand of 
               hair behind her ear) I already 
               miss you. Ada, do you love me?

ADA considers this question. Clearly she doesn't know, the question is 
more complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she 
kisses him strongly and sexually. BAINES pulls away confused. ADA 
finishes dressing. BAINES comes up behind her to help with the 
buttons.

                         BAINES
               (anxiously) Come tomorrow. If 
               you are serious, come tomorrow.

ADA turns and kisses him passionately, with the new born enthusiasm of 
someone who has just discovered their appetite for sex. Then as 
quickly as she began, she takes her hood and cape and goes to leave.

                         BAINES
               Tomorrow?

She nods and is gone.

FLORA and ADA are both in their white nightgowns. FLORA stands behind 
ADA on a chair trying to sort out the knots that have matted at the 
back of ADA's head. ADA shakes her head from side to side playfully, 
making the difficult job impossible.

                         FLORA
               Stay still! It's the very worst

FLORA tries to hold her mother's head still but ADA's high spirits are

the face.

FLORA starts to giggle and retaliates flinging her own hair from side 
to side. The two women are twirling in the small bedroom their hair 
flying about them, FLORA is shrieking with the fun, then stops dizzy 
and sick. ADA continues flicking FLORA as she twirls.

Music builds and plays throughout.) The sky is dark and the wind is 
ballooning ADA's cape, wrapping it up high around her. The tree tops 
are swaying furiously. Inside the bush it is dark and ADA hurries up 
through the path. She is out or breath and glancing behind her as if 
to guard against followers, when directly in front of her STEWART 
steps out onto her path. ADA stops short. The look on his face is 
unlike any expression she has yet seen. His eyes do not look at her, 
but all about her in a way more animal than human. She lowers her eyes 
and calling his bluff walks steadily past him. But STEWART takes her 
arm and spinning her back, pulls her close and blind to all protest 
kisses her. ADA struggles furiously. His grip falters and she steps 
back staring at him, then runs off down the hill, but STEWART is on 
top of her clasping her skirts, pulling her towards him hand over 
hand, she slips and falls to the ground. STEWART is upon her, lifting 
her dress, touching her legs, ADA goes quite still, which throws 
STEWART long enough for her to scramble away, yet again STEWART 
catches her and again they roll on the ground, STEWART touching and 
kissing her, ADA turning herself this way and that to avoid it. There 
is a cat and mouse quality to their mute struggle finally broken by 
FLORA calling up the path, distraught and in tears, her angel wings 
have twisted about her waist.

STEWART has missed.

ADA's face pales in the diminishing light. Exasperated by the 
threatened incarceration she shakes her head with anguish and moving 
to the piano lifts the lid and plays several bars brutally and 
strongly. She passes on to the bedroom, where she picks up the small 
hand mirror and looks at her face puckered with frustration. She 
touches her face and neck tenderly, then throws herself on the bed, 
face to the wall, her hands over her ears.

FLORA stands over her mother.

               can play cards together.

ADA rolls over, her eyes closed she pushes her face and body against 
the mattress. The movement is sensual and removed. FLORA stops dealing 
the cards on to the bed and watches her mother puzzled.

STEWART carries a lit candle. ADA continues her playing

FLORA passes a hand in front of ADA's face.

On the way back to the barricaded hut FLORA swings between ADA and 
STEWART.

                         FLORA
               One, two, three
               One, two, three

ADA glances around at the bush. FLORA beams enjoying a feeling of 
familyness of which she is now the boss. The two women go ahead into 
the hut which STEWART shuts and secures with a beam.

Sc 103INT     STEWART'S HUT ADA'S BEDROQOMNIGHT     Sc 103

It is night. ADA is tossing in the small bed beside FLORA, her hair 
wound across her face, she makes low moaning sounds as she pushes her 
face and body up against the sleeping FLORA. Her movement and moans 
increase until she wakes suddenly sitting bolt upright.

Sc 104INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN & BEDROOMNIGHT     Sc 104

ADA walks through the kitchen, small slithers of moonlight lighting 
her path. She walks past the piano into STEWART'S room who has gone to 
sleep with his candle still alight. ADA looks, then slowly her hand 
hovers above him before lightly touching his face. His eyes open, he 
looks towards ADA anxious and surprised, but as ADA continues, his 
reserve breaks and he is captive to his own sensations. She pulls down 
the sheet and strokes his neck, shoulders, chest, he reaches out 
towards her.

                         STEWART
               Ada!

But ADA scowls and pulls away roughly, STEWART lies back anxious not 
to break the spell and when he is still ADA continues to caress his 
chest. His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a 
child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting. ADA continues like a 
nurse spreading ointment on a wound, tenderly and attentively she 
strokes down towards his belly. STEWART'S skin goose bumps and be 
shudders. He puts his hand on hers to still it1 she slides hers out 
and continues stroking. He looks at her pleadingly and childlike, she 
stops and kisses the soft skin of his belly, STEWART groans clutching 
the mattress. ADA seems removed from STEWART as if she has a separate 
curiosity of her own.

Next day AUNT MORAG stands circling in STEWART'S small darkened house. 
FLORA and ADA sit quietly together

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a 
               dank cave.

                         NESSIE
               Yes, like a cave.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!

STEWART comes into the house with some logs, AUNT MORAG follows him 
across to the fire.

                         AUNT MORAG
               Alisdair, is it because of our 
               play? Have the natives 
               aggressed you?


She continues following him to the door.

I have to say you have done the wrong thing here, you see you have put 
the latch on the outside. When you close the door, (and she doses it) 
it will be the Macna that lock you in, you see? With the latch on that 
side you are quite trapped.

                         NESSIE
               (nodding her head in imitation) 
               ... you are quite trapped.

AUNT MORAG walks inside and continues to the table where her basket 
full of clothes and packets of food have been left. She lifts it from 
the table and begins to spread the cloth.

                         AUNT MORAG
               We have just come from George 
               Banes' and they have taken him 
               over. It is no wonder he is 
               leaving, he has got in too deep 
               with the natives. They sit on 
               his floor as proud as Kings, 
               but without a shred of manners.

                         NESSIE
               (in unison) ... without a shred 
               of manners.

NESSIE and AUNT MORAG are unpacking parcels of cakes and biscuits
 on plates putting them about the table.

                         AUNT MORAG
               He is quite altered, as if they 
               had been trying some native 
               witchcraft on him. Well 
               tomorrow or the day after he 
               will be gone.

                         STEWART
               Baines is packing up?

                         AUNT MORAG
               Well he has NOTHING to pack, 
               but he is leaving. And it is 
               just as well; Nessie has 
               foolishly grown an affection 
               for him ... we have had some 
               tears

At this mention NESSlE's face crumples and tears again begin to flow.

                         AUNT MORAG
               (very firmly) STOP IT! STOP! 

NESSIE remarkably obeys, blinking her face back to shape.

ADA attempts to disguise her agitation, she moves to the piano and 
strokes it, she begins to play.

               I am quite frightened of the 
               way back, we must leave in good 
               light. Will we be safe?

                         STEWART
               (wanting them gone) If you 
               leave soon, yes, I am sure of 
               it.

STEWART and MORAG watch ADA at the piano. Her playing develops until 
she is fully absorbed. AUNT MORAG is intrigued despite herself

Sc 106EXT     BUSY ROAD TO MISSIONDAY     Sc 106

On the edge of the bush beside the dirt road to town AUNT MORAG 
attempts a discrete toilet stop. NESSIE keeps guard holding up the 
cape while one of their MAORI charges holds up another.

                         AUNT MORAG
               You know I am thinking of the 
               piano. She does not play the 
               piano as we do Nessie.

The cape begins to droop as NESSIE listens.

               UP! UP! No she is a strange 
               creature and her saying is 
               strange like a mood that passes 
               into you. You cannot teach that 
               Nessie, one may like to learn 
               but that could not be taught.

NESSIE again lets the cape droop.

               Up! Your playing is plain and 
               true and that is what I like. 
               To have a sound creep inside 
               you is not all pleasant

A fluttering sound in the bush.

               what is that?

                         NESSIE
               (frightened) Ohhhhhh!

                         MARY/HENI
               (slow, relaxed) A pid-geon 
               Auntie.

The party finish and hurry a little spooked on the road to town.

Sc 107INT     STEWART'S ROOM     NIGHT     Sc 107

It is night. ADA enters the room, STEWART looks at her shyly.

                         STEWART
               I've been hoping you would 
               come.

ADA strokes his brow. STEWART closes his eyes, breathing heavily 
relieved. ADA strokes the nape of his neck and on down his back. 
STEWART'S face puckers, his eyes fill with tears. She strokes so 
softly, the tenderness is shocking to him. Gently she pulls his under-
garment down, exposing his buttocks. STEWART grabs nervously at them, 
hauling them up with his hands. ADA unclenches his fist and once more, 
slowly pulls them down. She begins to stroke his buttocks, STEWART is 
painfully eroticised, painfully vulnerable, he begins to weep, the 
intimacy and soft-ness unman him and he is helpless. STEWART sits up 
hunching over himself, retreating

                         STEWART
               I want to touch you Why can't I 
               touch you? Do you like me?

Slowly he raises his head to look at ADA. She looks back moved by his 
helplessness, but distanced as if it has nothing to do with her.

               Do you?

ADA does not respond. STEWART slumps into disappointment and despair.

               Why? Why not?!

Sc 108INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN     DAY     Sc 108

The next morning, ADA, FLORA and STEWART sit together in the small 
dark hut. FLORA preens a miniature landscape of moss and tiny branches 
all piled on a dinner plate. A slit of sunlight falling across the top 
small branches gives it a magical glow. FLORA's small dirty fingers 
push in another 'tree', she looks up happily

                         FLORA
This is going to be Adam's tree 
and then I'm going to make a 
serpent to live here, with a 
very long tongue. (She pokes 
her tongue out and waggles it).

STEWART reads, he glances at ADA who is glum and lifeless.

Sc 109INT     STEWART'S HUT     DAY     Sc 109

ADA and FLORA wake to sunlight streaming in on their faces, more and 
more of it as STEWART rips the boards from the windows FLORA runs 
about in nightgown and boots happy to be in the sunlight. ADA winds 
her hair into a bun. STEWART walks inside, he packs food and fencing 
equipment

                         STEWART
               (Clears his throat) We must 
               both get on. I have decided to 
               trust you to stay here. You 
               will not see Baines?

               (ADA nods) Good, good. Perhaps 
               with more trying you will come 
               to like me?

Sc 110EXT     STEWART'S          DAY     Sc 110

ADA hangs out washing restlessly scanning the bushline. A tiny STEWART 
walks along the crest of the hill, eventually dropping out of sight.

Sc 111INT     STEWART'S HUT     DAY     Sc 111

Inside the hut ADA is pacing, anguished and frustrated. Impulsively 
she picks up a knife from the kitchen table, opens the back of the 
piano and cuts one of the keys loose. Carefully she engraves on the 
side in Victorian handscript.

DEAR GEORGE, YOU HAVE MY HEART. ADA McGRATH.

Sc 112EXT     STEWART'S          DAY     Sc 112

Under the sheets FLORA has constructed a dolls' clothes line on which 
she hangs small strips of cloth ADA hands her the key wrapped and tied 
in white cotton. ADA signs. Her black shadow behind the sheet recalls 
the macabre play.

               No!

The little girl continues defiantly with her miniature washing. ADA 
rips the washing line up and flings it aside. FLORA is shocked, 
stunned. She takes the key and walking off she turns and shouts.

                         FLORA
               We're not supposed to visit 
               him'.

ADA signals GO!


Sc 113EXT     PATH TO BAINES' AT FENCEDAYSc 113

At the junction of the path to BAINES' hut is the beginning of 
STEWART'S boundary fence. At this place FLORA has paused. She looks 
back to see if her mother is watching; she's not- FLORA turns sharply 
right so that she now follows alongside STEWART'S boundary fence and-
away from BAINES' hut.

Sc 114EXT     HILLS WITH FENCE     DAY     Sc 114
The fence appears and disappears behind hills.  Flora too dips behind 
the hills to reappear on the other side. She sings a brisk song to 
herself.

foxglove.

The fence line seems endless as the tired FLOW4 trudges up yet another 
hill but from there, she can see where the fence finishes, half way up 
the crest of the next hill and at this point is STEWART, driving in a 
new fence post. He is watched by MANA and his friend who squat passing 
a pipe between themselves. MANA strums tirelessly on his buttons.

                         FLORA
               Mumma wanted me to give this to 
               Mr. Baines.

She holds out the cotton covered piano key. STEWART looks up.

               I thought maybe it was not a 
               proper thing to do. 

STEWART keeps working, hammering the post into the earth.

               Shall I open it?

                         STEWART
               No!!

He stops and takes the key, suspicious and uncomfortable. He slowly 
unwraps it and turning it over reads it. Squeezing the key in his 
fist, STEWART staggers off in a daze, He returns, picks up his open 
pack spilling the nails. Finally he drops the pack and the key) and 
leaves with only his axe. FLORA follows confused. The MAORIS waste no 
time investigating the booty. MANA presses the piano key repeatedly.

towards the hut, his axe swinging in his hand. FLORA is far behind 
him, her angelwings sodden.

STEWART bursts into the hut, his wet hair is splattered against his 
forehead. his face is white. ADA looks up from her book, moving her 
hands from the table. STEWART swings his axe hard. It slices into the 
table, splitting a section off her book. ADA pushes her chair back.

                         STEWART
               (exasperated) why? WHY? I 
               trusted you!

He pulls the axe out of the table and swings it at the piano.

               WHY?

ADA runs forward to restrain him, but it sinks deep into the wood. The 
struck piano lets ont a strange resonant moan.

               I trusted you, do you hear? I 
               trusted you. I could love you.

He takes her by the wrist.

               Why do you do this? Why do you 
               make me hurt you? Do you bear? 
               Why have you done it? We could 
               be happy

STEWART shakes her violently.

               You have made me angry. SPEAK!!

Sc 119EXT     STEWART'S HUT & WOODCHOPDAY     Sc 119

He pulls her out of the hut, past the now terrified FLORA.

               You shall answer for this. 
               Speak or not you shall answer for 
               it!

He drags her out through the mud, towards the wood chop. It is raining 
hard.

ADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared. She 
bucks and struggles, but STEWART is infinitely stronger. At the wood 
chop she breaks free and crawls away through the woodchips and mud. 
But axe in hand he grasps her by the neck of her dregs, then her hair, 
and pulls her backwards towards the cutting block. There, he takes her 
right hand and holds it in place with his boot, so that only ADA's 
index finger shows, ADA's head is held twisted between the wood chop 
and STEWART'S leg.

                         STEWART
               (anguished) Do you love him? Do 
               you?! Is it him you love?

ADA blinks rigid with fear. The rain is driving down.

                         FLORA
               No, she says NOOOOOO!!!

The axe falls. ADA's face buckles in pain. Blood squirts onto FLORA's 
white pinafore, her angel wings are splattered in mud.

                         FLORA
               (Screaming) Mother!!

ADA stands. She looks faint, her finger is pulsing blood, she shakes 
her hand then seeing the blood she puts it behind her back shocked. 
She watches FLORA, concerned and confused. Uncontrollably her whole 
body starts to shake and as if by reflex ADA begins to walk. FLORA 
trots parallel to her.

                         FLORA
               Mama!

ADA keeps walking blindly like her being depends on it. Her face is 
ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large 
tree stump. She sinks into the mud.

STEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA 
who backs away from him terrified.

                         FLORA
               (quietly) Mama.

                         STEWART

               if he ever tries to see her again 
               I'll take off another and another 
               and another!

The figures seem tiny amidst the rain drenched skeleton forest.

Sc 121EXT     MAORI PA     DAY     Sc 121

The formal farewells are over and HIRA and BAINES finishes shaking 
hands and pressing noses with her people.

HIRA holds his arm, she is sad and tearful. He places his hat on her 
head affectionately and slips her a much appreciated tin of tobacco.

A soft rain begins to fall. BAINES and HIRA make their way past the 
Meeting House and the low sleeping houses to the Pa entrance where his 
horse waits,

                         HIRA
               I worry for us Peini. Pakeha 
               cunning like wind, KNOCK you

               they say, how can pakeha get 
               our land if we won't sell it?"

A crowd of children run beside them, dogs scurry off and pigs are 
kicked out of the way, their owners protesting loudly. Some hold mats 
over their heads to protect themselves from the rain, one has a 
battered umbrella.

                         HIRA
               They wrong Peini. We need guns 
               to hold it.

BAINES mounts his heavily laden horse. MANA pushes forward to say his 
farewell, but is abruptly shoved aside, evidently unpopular with the 
others. BAINES glances over and sees the piano key the man has 
fashioned into an earring.

                         HIRA

               nowhere to go.

HIRA's voice rises as BAINES lets go of her arm and rides through the 
group towards MANA. He takes the piano key in his hand, MANA pulls 
back.

BAINES crosses through the pony paddock of the one room colonial 
school hall, school house. He has a piece off flax knotted around his 
waist to bold up his trousers. In the paddock are five very shabby 
looking rides'. one huge old wagon horse, built to carry a whole 
family, down to a tiny sour looking Shetland. The girls have long, 
stained, once white pinafores and everyone wears boots that seem too 
big, except the little boy who has the front cut off his hoots so his 
toes can hang out.

Four little girls play a sedate game of skip rope, using a bush vine.  
BAINES watches, noticing in particular a little girl of about 9 with a 
bock. The boys and some of the wilder girls play BullRush.

The girl with the book goes off sit by a little stream. BAINES follows 
and sits beside her.

                         BAINES
               Can you read?

The little girl immediately closes the book and walks off.

The girl keeps walking, before she turns about to watch him from a 
safe distance.

Another little girl drops down from a tree.

                         TREE GIRL
               I can.

                         BAINES
               You can read? 

(She is very small.)

                         TREE GIRL
               Yes ... lots of things.

The skipping group of girls join them.

                         BIG SISTER
               She can't read, she's my 
               sister, I ought to know.
               Are those sweets?

                         TREE GIRL
               I can read!

                         BIG SISTER
               She can't.

BAINES holds out the packet to the little girl. 

               Don't give her one.

BAINES does anyway.

                         BIG SISTER
               She can't read.

The little girl throws the lolly paper away, which one of the other 
girls picks up and sniffs, she hands it to the others.

               Mmm Caramels

                         BAINES
               Can you read?

He holds out the piano key BIG SISTER takes it with great authority, 
her friends crowd behind her. She frowns at the writing. She turns it 
over.

                         BIG SISTER
               Running writing, we haven't 
               done that yet.

                         READING GIRL
               Myrtle can read it, her mother 
               taught her.

The key is snatched from BIG SISTER and given to MYRTLE, the girl with 
the book. The others crowd around.

                         MYRTLE
               (frowning) D e a r  G e o r g e

The children look over at BAINES to see if this is right so far.

               You (in unison)... have

                         BIG SISTER
               That's "My".

                         BIG SISTER

               it doesn't make sense) Ada 
               McGrath.

                         BIG SISTER
               It doesn't make sense.

The little girls read it again together. MYRTLE turns the key over 
matter of factly to see if there is more writing.

                         MYRTLE
               That's all

They all look up at him.

                         BAINES
               Say it again, just you.

Everyone turns and listens to MYRTLE

                         MYRTLE
               Dear George you have my heart, 
               Ada McGrath.

She gives a little "Is that all?" gesture.

                         BAINES
               You say it. (He points to BIG 
               SISTER, who has a crazy deep 
               voice.)

                         BIG SISTER
               Dear George you have my heart, 
               Ada McGrath.


Another little girl spontaneously recites the message. And so does 
another. Through all this BAINES keeps his bead down shaking it in 
disbelief and shy happiness. He starts to laugh with relief and 
pleasure. The little girls think it is something funny in the line and 
continue to repeat it, which each then appears to give BAINES fresh 
pleasure. Meanwhile the smallest of the girls is quietly helping 
herself to the sweets.

BAINES jumps off his horse and strides into his hut.

Sc 130INT     BAINES' HUT     DUSK     Sc 130

Inside he finds FLORA crouching in a corner, her face is white, tear 
stained and splattered with mud. Her angel wings are squashed behind 
her and blood stained. On seeing BAINES she cries with renewed pain 
and relief

                         BAINES
               What has happened? Hush, hush, 
               what is it?

FLORA thrusts the wrapped finger at BAINES. He takes the blood soaked 
object and unwraps it. The finger unravels into his hand, he reels 
back groaning, choking about to be sick.

                         FLORA
               (yelling) He says you're not to 
               see her or he'll chop her up!

               What happened?

But FLORA cannot speak. She bursts into loud sobs. BAINES kneels in 
front of her shaking her.

               TELL ME! TELL ME!

BAINES stops shaking her, she scrambles away and out the door. BAINES 
chases after her.

               him.

HIRA takes the quivering FLORA in her arms.

away.

STEWART walks outside his hut disconsolate.

Sc 133INT     STEWART'S HUT     NIGHT     Sc 133

STEWART enters ADA's room with a lamp. He puts it down beside her on 
the table. He studies her pale face and dry lips. ADA's eyes flicker 
open.

                         STEWART
               (speaking to his feet) 
               I lost my temper. I'm sorry.

STEWART looks at ADA.

                         STEWART
               You broke my trust, you pushed 
               me hard, to hard. (he sighs) 
               You cannot send love to HIM you 
               cannot do it.  Even to think on 
               it makes me angry, very angry

ADA opens her eyes and looks at STEWART. It is evident she hears 
nothing and has understood nothing, she is struggling with pain. Her 
face grimaces and she groans.

                         STEWART
               I meant to love you. I clipped 
               your wing, that is all.

STEWART sings two lines of an English love ballad to ADA.

                         STEWART
               We shall be together, you will 
               see it will be better...

Her forehead is damp with fever. She thrashes at the blankets. STEWART 
pulls them off to cool her. He feels her brow.

                         STEWART
               (whispering) ... 
               my love bird.

Her nightgown is damp with sweat and clings to her body. STEWART 
reaches out to adjust her gown, his hand touches her leg and he holds 
it there, feeling a tingle of pleasure, that grows and builds the 
longer his hand remains.

                         STEWART
               Ohhhhh my love

His hand begins to move further and further up her leg, nudging the 
nightgown higher and higher. He looks at her face. She is closed-eyed, 
unconscious. STEWART'S face crinkles into a pained expression and all 
his control melts into a drive to hold and extend this moment. He 
brings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee, her thigh. A 
new thought occurs to him, a terrible thought, but as he has phrased 
the thought to himself, he cannot resist it. He glances at her face 
still fevered and unconscious. Quietly, stealthily, he begins to undo 
his belt buckle. He bends across her to gently separate her legs. As 
he moves his body over her, he looks towards her and to his shame and 
horror she is looking directly back at him, her eyes perfectly on his, 
perfectly focused. Quietly STEWART moves back and pulls down her gown, 
all the time keeping his eyes on her.

                         STEWART
               You are feeling better?

ADA's lips move slightly and STEWART turns suddenly as if he has heard 
something. Slowly he turns back to ADA.

STEWART looks at ADA intently, moving closer to her bed, closer to ADA 
his eyes locked on hers.

                         STEWART
               What...?

The sound of his own voice makes him blink. He watches her as if 
listening to her speak in a voice that is so faint, and distant, that 
only with great concentration and perseverance can he make it out. As 
he watches her his face transforms; his eyes fill, his lips soften and 
his eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own.

The kerosene lamp burns fitfully, fluttering a light pulse across 
their faces. STEWART moves closer to ADA. Outside a wind bangs the 
iron roof and rubs branches against each other making a high-pitched 
see-saw sound. He leans closer still.

STEWART carrying a candle in a glass box makes his way through ghostly 
tree stumps. In his other arm he has his gun.

Sc 135EXT/INT     BAINES'     NIGHT     Sc 135

At BAINES' hut STEWART steps over the curled figure of HIRA sleeping 
on the verandah and walks through the hut towards the bedroom where a 
lit candle flickers.

Sc 136INT     BAINES' BEDROOMNIGHT     Sc 136

In the bed lies FLORA wrapped in a blanket with BAINES beside her, axe 
in hand, both fast asleep. STEWART nudges BAINES awake with the butt 
of his rifle prodding him under the chin. BAINES wakes rudely with a 
start, frozen by the sight of STEWART and his rifle.

                         STEWART
               Put that away, on the floor.

BAINES obeys, careful not to disturb the sleeping child. STEWART sits 
near the bed on a box, resting his gun across his knee, his face is 
glowing, he looks closely at BAINES, examining him.

                         STEWART
               I look at you, at your face. I 
               have had that face in my head 
               hating it. But now I am here 
               seeing it ... it's nothing, you 
               blink, you have your mark, you 
               look at me through your eyes, 
               yes. you are even scared of me

STEWART laughs.

                         STEWART
               Look at you!

BAINES watches him stiffly, disconcerted, unable to read STEWART'S 
strange mood. STEWART stares back at him.

                         STEWART
               (softly) 
               Has Ada ever spoken to you?

                         BAINES
               You mean in signs?

                         STEWART
               No, words. You have never heard 
               words?

                         BAINES
               No, not words.

STEWART nods.

                         STEWART
               Never thought you heard words?

BAINES shakes his head.


                         STEWART
               (slowly) 
               She has spoken to me. I heard 
               her voice. There was no sound, 
               but I beard it here (he presses 
               his forehead with a palm of his 
               hand). Her voice was there in 
               my head. I watched her lips, 
               they did not make the words, 
               yet the harder I listened the 
               clearer I heard her, as clear 
               as I hear you, as dear as I 
               hear my own voice.

                         BAINES
               (trying to understand) 
               Spoken words?

                         STEWART
               No, but her words are in my 
               head. (he looks at BAINES and 
               pauses) I know what you think, 
               that it's a trick, that I'm 
               making it up. No, the words I 
               heard, were her words.

                         BAINES
               (suspiciously) What are they?

STEWART looks up at the ceiling as if reciting something he has learnt 
by heart and means to repeat exactly as he heard it.

                         STEWART
               She said, "I have to go, let me 
               go, let Baines take me away, 
               let him try and save me. I am 
               frightened of my will, of what 
               it might do it is so strange 
               and strong".

BAINES recovering himself eyes STEWART angrily.

                         BAINES
               You punished her wrongly, it 
               was me, my fault.

STEWART does not answer. Finally be looks up, his eyes full with 
tears.

                         STEWART
               Understand me. I am here for 
               her, for her I wonder that I 
               don't wake, that I am not 
               asleep to be here talking with 
               you. I love her. But what is 
               the use? She doesn't care for 
               me. I wish her gone. I wish you 
               gone. I want to wake and find 
               it was a dream, that is what I 
               want. I want to believe I am 
               not this man. I want my self 
               back; the one I know.

FLORA moves and turns in her sleep. The two men watch. Her brow frowns 
then smoothes. Her eyelids roll as her eyes dart back and forth in 
dream.

               it.

SCENE 144 DELETED

Sc 145EXT     AT SEA/BEACHDAY     Sc 145

The canoe has paddled away from the shore. FLORA leans over the edge 
of the canoe, her mouth open, her hair held back by BAINES.

                         FLORA
               I can't

BAINES rubs her back. FLORA straightens up.

               I can't.

They retake their seats, FLORA's back to the piano, while BAINES sits 
next to ADA. He tenderly takes her good hand. ADA removes hers and 
signs to FLORA who looks at her mother then BAINES amazed.

                         BAINES
               What did she say?

                         FLORA
               (puzzled) She says, throw the 
               piano overboard.

                         BAINES
               (to ADA) It's quite safe, they 
               are managing...

ADA signs again.

                         BAINES
               (Cautiously) What?

                         FLORA
               She says, throw it overboard. 
               She doesn't want it. She says 
               it's spoiled

                         BAINES
               I have the key here, look, I'll 
               have it mended...

ADA mimes directly to BAINES, "PUSH IT OVER". Her determination is 
increasing.

                         MAORI OARSMAN
               Ae! Peja. Turakina'. Bushit? 
               Peja te kawheha kite moana.
               (Yeah she's right push it over, 
               push the coffin in the water.) 
                    SUBTITLED

                         BAINES
(softly, urgently) Please, Ada, 
you will regret it. It's your 
piano, I want you to have it.

But ADA does not listen, she is adamant and begins to untie the ropes.

                         FLORA
               (panicking)
               She doesn't want IT!

The canoe is unbalancing as ADA struggles with the ropes.

                         BAINES
               All right. sit down, sit down.

ADA sits, pleased. Her eyes glow and her face is now alive.

BAINES speaks to the MAORIS who stop paddling and together they loosen 
the ropes securing the piano to the canoe.

As they maneuver the piano to the edge ADA Jocks into the water. She 
puts her hand into the sea and moves it back and forth.

The piano is carefully lowered and with a heave topples over. As the 
piano splashes into the sea, the loose ropes speed their way after it. 
ADA watches them snake past her feet and then out of a fatal 
curiosity, odd and undisciplined, she steps into a loop.

The rope tightens and grips her foot so that she is snatched into the 
sea, and pulled by the piano down through the cold water.

Sc 146INT     SEA NEAR BEACH     DAY     Sc 146

Bubbles tumble from her mouth. Down she falls, on and on. her eyes are 
open, her clothes twisting about her. The MAORIS diving after her 
cannot reach her in these depths. ADA begins to struggle. She kicks at 
the rope, but it holds tight around her boot. She kicks hard again and 
then with her other foot, levers herself free from her shoe. The piano 
and her shoe continue their fall while ADA floats above, suspended in 
the deep water, then suddenly her body awakes and fights, struggling 
upwards to the surface.

Sc 147 EXT     AT SEA BEACH     DAY     Sc 147

As ADA breaks the surface her VOICE OVER begins:

                         ADA (VOICE OVER)
               What a death!
               What a chance!
               What a surprise!
               My will has chosen life!?
               Still it has had me spooked and 
               many others besides!

ADA coughing and spluttering is pulled on to the canoe. She is wrapped 
in jackets and blankets.

Underwater we see the canoe bottom, its oars dipping the surface

Sc 149INT     ADA'S NELSON DRAWING ROOM     DUSK     Sc 149

                         ADA (VOICE OVER)
               I teach piano now in Nelson. 
               George has fashioned me a metal 
               finger tip, I am quite the town 
               freak which satisfies! I am 
               learning to speak. My sound is 
               still so bad I am ashamed. I 
               practice only when I am alone 
               and it is dark.

ADA's hands move across the piano keys, her metal finger shines in the 
dull light.

Sc 150INT     ADA'S NELSON DRAWING ROOM     NIGHT     Sc 150

ADA paces up and down the small drawing room. There are no lights on 
only  a dim blue evening wash. Over her head she has a dark cloth, her 
voice makes low guttural sounds as it repeats the vowels.

DISSOLVE TO: 

Sc 151INT     SEA BED NEAR BEACH     DAY     Sc 151

                         ADA (VOICE OVER)
               At night! I think of my piano 
               in its ocean grave, and 
               sometimes of myself floating 
               above it. Down there everything 
               is so still and silent that it 
               lulls me to sleep. It is a 
               weird lullaby and so it is; it 
               is mine.

ADA's piano on the seabed, its lid fallen away. Above floats ADA, her 
hair and arms stretched out in a gesture of surrender, her body slowly 
turning on the end of the rope. The seaweed's rust coloured fronds 
reach out to touch her.

THERE IS A SILENCE WHERE HATH BEEN NO SOUND
THERE IS A SILENCE WHERE NO SOUND MAY BE
IN THE COLD GRAVE, UNDER THE DEEP DEEP SEA.
