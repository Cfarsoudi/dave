               EXT. STYGIAN DARKNESS - NIGHT

               STYGIAN DARKNESS

               The suggestion of traveling through space. Suddenly a star 
               sparkles to life in the distance. Gives rise to another... 
               and another... until we're looking at a whole galaxy of stars. 
               No, not stars. LIGHTS. NEON LIGHTS. A throbbing skyline of 
               neon. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. As seen from a descending aerial 
               shot. We PLUNGE down into her shimmering embrace... DISSOLVING 
               TO:

               EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

               Cruising the Strip, taking in modern day Las Vegas. Sin City 
               gone theme park. Gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon: THE 
               MGM GRAND... EXCALIBUR... LUXOR... TREASURE ISLAND... passing 
               revamped faithfuls like CAESARS and THE DESERT INN...

               ...then heading DOWNTOWN to Fremont Street, where "old school" 
               Vegas makes its last stand. BINION'S HORSESHOE, THE FOUR 
               QUEENS, THE LAS VEGAS CLUB arid...

               THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO

               One thing's for sure. This place ain't no bastard child of 
               Epcott Center. At least, not yet. Sure there's some flash 
               going on, but it's more class than overkill.

               This is where the pro's come to savor a time forgotten. A 
               joint where every dealer knows your name. Where part of the 
               allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper 
               of worn felt. Where "funny business" doesn't just get you 
               blacklisted... It gets you dead.

               Lets us enter.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

               CREDITS SEQUENCE

               TRACKING through the casino floor; highlighting SLOT MACHINE 
               PAY-OFFS and pockets of rowdy players winning at BLACKJACK, 
               CRAPS and ROULETTE. It's just one of those nights. The tables 
               are on fire.

               A FLOOR MANAGER nods as a hefty bet is paid out to a shooter 
               at a craps table: He checks out his watch, anxious for the 
               arrival of...

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               From behind a FIGURE in a suit. All we see is a murky 
               reflection in gold elevator doors. The floor numbers 
               descending rapidly...

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               STICKMEN, CROUPIERS, DEALERS

               all anticipating the arrival of...

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               The elevator doors open... and we PAN DOWN to the figure's 
               feet. He steps out onto the casino floor... and right away 
               we notice he has a pronounced limp.

               Following behind the figure. We haven't seen his features 
               yet... (and won't for a while.)

               TRACKING SERIES 

               -- the figure (seen in soft focus) passes a ROULETTE TABLE, 
               the wheel already in mid-spin. His hand casually brushes the 
               side of the table... and we PAN ACROSS to the wheel -- just 
               in time to see the ball landing on 00. The players HOWL 
               defeat. The croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a 
               slight nod of respect to the passing wraith...

               -- TRACKING PAST SOME BLACKJACK TABLES... RACKING from the 
               passing figure (still in soft focus) to a DEALER calling 
               out:

                                     DEALER
                         Insurance?

               At the next table, ANOTHER DEALER pulls a six card 21. Off 
               the players' stunned reactions. No way! One of the players 
               instinctively glances behind him... but the figure has moved 
               on. The dealer stifles a grin, her eyes following the figure 
               as he heads toward...

               -- A HOT CRAPS TABLE. The CROWD APPLAUDS as the shooter lands 
               a hard eight. The dice are fished back to the player. He 
               shakes them up with double ought bravado. We RACK from his 
               hand LARGE in the f.g. to our murky figure passing in the 
               background. The player throws... (we keep tracking with the 
               figure) as the stickman calls it: SEVEN OUT! to a thundering 
               chorus of disappointment.

               -- Our figure passes by in the foreground, while in the 
               background, we see a growing line of shame at one of the ATM 
               MACHINES.

               -- Following behind our figure as he turns into a corridor 
               of SLOT MACHINES. CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE from the far end of 
               the corridor. As the murky figure approaches, a player in 
               the f.g. hits a jackpot.

               Another player in mid-ground is also in the midst of a payout.

               Suddenly -- with the approach of the figure -- both payouts 
               trickle to a stop.

                                     PLAYER IN F.G.
                              (kicks the slot machine)
                         Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it 
                         out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey, 
                         this ain't right. S'posed to be eight 
                         hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn 
                         manager? Who's in charge of these 
                         rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change 
                         lady...

               CASINO BAR FLOOR - BAR AREA - NIGHT

               FOLLOWING BEHIND the figure as he turns out of the slot 
               corridor and heads over to the bar. He pours himself a cup 
               of coffee.

                                     FIGURE/BERNIE
                         Hey Doris, you got any cream?

               DORIS THE BARTENDER wanders over with a small container. She 
               starts to pour... Empty. We quickly STEADICAM AROUND to reveal 
               BERNIE LOOTZ's features for the first time. His sad sack 
               eyes register scant surprise at the empty cream container.

                                     BERNIE
                         Forget it.

               He's just about to leave, when an attractive COCKTAIL WAITRESS 
               cruises up. NATALIE BELISARIO -- late 20's-mid-30's. 
               Everything about her sparkles, except her eyes.

               They're post-mortem. She appears frazzled. Sifts through 
               some coin tips.

                                     NATALIE
                              (sotto)
                         Shit.
                              (to Doris)
                         Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please.

               A sheepish look comes over Bernie. He tries to catch her 
               eye. She doesn't even glance at him.

                                     BERNIE
                         Hi, Natalie.

               She looks at him. Only the faintest hint of recognition.

                                     NATALIE
                         Hi. Uh...

                                     BERNIE
                         Bernie.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah, Bernie.
                              (to Doris)
                         Hey, you seen Shelly around? He 
                         promised to position me at the tables 
                         tonight. I've been on skid row all 
                         week.

                                     DORIS
                              (chilly)
                         You didn't settle me from last night.

                                     NATALIE
                         No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way 
                         under. It's been, like, an A.A. 
                         convention the whole week. I'll make 
                         up for it tonight. Promise.

               Doris mutters something under her breath -- heard that one 
               before -- and dumps Natalie's drinks on her tray.

                                     BERNIE
                         If I see Shelly, I'll let him know. 
                         That you're looking for him.

               Natalie grabs up her tray. Doesn't even look at Bernie.

                                     NATALIE
                         Thanks.

               She takes off.

                                     DORIS
                         Bitch. That's the third time this 
                         month...
                              (to Bernie)
                         Let me get you that cream.

                                     BERNIE
                              (staring after Natalie)
                         Nah, it's okay.

                                     DORIS
                         Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not 
                         unless you're looking to get short-
                         changed.

               She raises the empty cream container for effect, turns it 
               over. A few drops dribble out.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie limps away from the bar. We hear another spike of 
               sound from the gaming area. As he approaches, a FLOORMAN 
               stops him.

                                     FLOORMAN
                         Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on 
                         eleven.

                                     BERNIE
                              (nods)
                         Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal. 
                         Have that... Natalie bring it over. 
                         The one working nickel slots next to 
                         the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly 
                         earlier, he wants her at the tables.

               The floorman nods, walks off. Bernie makes for the rowdy 
               gaming tables. Takes his time about it. His approach brings 
               an ill-wind to the area. The players appear to sense it.

               It's in their reactions. A slight hesitation of the dice.

               Fingers tensing over a pile of chips. A hand tugging at a 
               tie.

               The Cooler has arrived.

               As he reaches table eleven, Natalie intercepts him with a 
               short glass of Chivas Regal.

                                     NATALIE
                         This is you, right?

                                     BERNIE
                              (takes it from her)
                         Thanks.

                                     NATALIE
                         Joe said I should stick around. You 
                         say something to Shelly?

               Bernie just smiles at her.

                                     NATALIE
                         Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks.

               She offers up a smile. It jump-starts those dormant eyes.

               Her whole face comes alive. Notches her up from an eight to 
               a ten. Bernie immediately glances away. He's afraid what she 
               might read in his gaze.

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't mention it.

               Bernie gestures her over to table eleven. Immediately makes 
               the HIGH ROLLER in question. A good old boy named BULLDOG.

               He's the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one 
               hand.

                                     BULLDOG
                         I'll make you a fortune on five and 
                         nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three 
                         fifty-four!

               Bernie grabs the drink from Natalie's tray, intentionally 
               bumps Bulldog...

                                     BERNIE
                         Hey, buddy, is this your drink?

                                     BULLDOG
                         Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here.

               Another man gladly accepts the drink. Meanwhile, Bulldog 
               sends the dice high up into the air. They drop perfectly on 
               the table. The stickman calls it.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out!

                                     BULLDOG
                         Mother-fucker!

                                     STICKMAN
                         Thank you for those bets, folks.

               The croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table.

               Bernie moves on quietly before anyone notices.

               But he's been noticed all right. By Natalie. Not quite sure 
               what she's just witnessed. Who is this guy?

               We hear a VOICE over the intercom.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Conway, party of twelve, please check 
                         your reservation at the Paradise 
                         Lounge.

               Bernie reacts immediately to the code words over the speaker.

                                     BERNIE
                              (to himself)
                         Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CASINO FLOOR CRAPS TABLE - MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A -- a player makes a hard six at a craps table. The players 
               howl...

               B -- from the same angle we PAN UP from losing dice to the 
               same guy. Bernie looming large in the background.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT

               A -- Bernie taking a seat at another blackjack table. Next 
               to him, a full table of players on a good run of cards.

               B -- The same table with less players as the dealer appears 
               to be gaining an edge over the players. The only thing filling 
               up are ashtrays.

               C -- Same again, with one player. This time with Natalie 
               watching in the background. Intrigued. QUICK JUMP CUTS show 
               the player's mountain of chips going down until there is 
               only one.

               D -- The dealer taps the felt for the man to bet his last 
               chip. After a moment of indecision he flips the chip into 
               the air...

                                                             BRIDGE CUT TO:

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - OVERLOOKING THE CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               ...the chip becoming an Alka-Seltzer dropping into a glass.

               The glass is in SHELLY KAPLOW's hand. Director of Casino 
               Operations for the Shangri-la. Late 40's-early 50's.

               Distinguished, slick, oozing charm. But lose the Cartier, 
               Armani and Paco Raban and you're looking at pure street.

               He's watching Bernie through the two-way glass. Shakes his 
               head in admiration.

               Suddenly the office door swings open. THREE MEN stride in.

               Shelly projects immediate deference to NICKY "FINGERS" 
               BONNATTO. Mid-50's. Former Geovassi family underboss from 
               "back east." The guy's a relic from the days before MBAs 
               became the weapon of choice in the "family" business. He 
               wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with 
               traces of Mulberry Street primer showing through.

               Nicky's accompanied by a pair of CORPORATE TYPES in Hugo 
               Boss threads. Shelly glances their way with a look that 
               suggests he's working himself into a full-on sphincter wind-
               up. Bad news x2. Shelly's muscle, LOU stands off to one side 
               with an apologetic expression.

                                     SHELLY
                         Nicky, how the hell are you? I didn't 
                         know you were coming in...

               Nicky reaches out to shake Shelly's hand. Gets nothing back, 
               then remembers.

                                     NICKY
                              (shakes his head)
                         Whassimater? You think I don't wash 
                         up after goin' to the John? Forget 
                         about it.

               Nicky grabs Shelly, embraces him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         You shoulda called ahead. I woulda 
                         sent a car...

                                     NICKY
                         Ehh. We thought we'd surprise you.

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, anytime, Nicky. Anytime.

               Shelly sizes up the corporate types.

                                     NICKY
                         Shelly, I want you to meet one of 
                         our smartest VPs, Larry Sokolov. And 
                         his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.

               Shelly sees where this is going. Larry extends his hand...

                                     LARRY
                         How do you do, Shelly?

               ...then catches himself. Quickly pulls it back. Shelly stares 
               him down for a tense beat.

                                     SHELLY
                         What can I get you boys to drink?

               Off their uncomfortable expressions...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - A SHORT WHILE LATER - NIGHT

               Shelly seated across from Nicky, Larry and Marty.

                                     SHELLY
                         So... what brings you to town, Nicky?

               Nicky looks cautiously across the table.

                                     NICKY
                         Look, Shelly, this is your joint, 
                         you run it the way you see fit. But 
                         we got a smart kid here and he's got 
                         some good ideas on how to revitalize 
                         the Shangri-la.

                                     SHELLY
                         Revitalize? What are you talking 
                         about? We did thirty-five million 
                         last year.

               Nicky shoots a look over at Larry and Marty. Larry takes 
               this as his cue.

                                     LARRY
                         First off, Shelly, I want you to 
                         know, I have nothing but respect for 
                         you. You've done a fantastic job 
                         with the Shangri-la for the last 
                         sixteen years. No one would dispute 
                         that.

                                     NICKY
                         Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly.

               Shelly nods carefully. But...

                                     LARRY
                         But, the business has changed out 
                         here. You just have to take a look 
                         at the Strip to see what I'm talking 
                         about.

                                     SHELLY
                         You mean, that amusement park mook 
                         fest out there? You know what that 
                         is? That's a fucking violation of 
                         something that used to be beautiful. 
                         That used to have class. Like a 
                         gorgeous high priced hooker with an 
                         exclusive clientele. And then that 
                         Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up 
                         and puts her in a family way.

               Nicky and Larry exchange looks. Marty drops his gaze into 
               his lap.

                                     SHELLY
                         Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat 
                         whore hiding behind too much makeup. 
                         I look at her and see all those ugly 
                         stretch marks and I want to cry. 
                         'Cause I remember her as she was.

                                     LARRY
                         Yes, well... there's no denying the 
                         bottom line. Those eyesores are raking 
                         it in. And we can't compete against 
                         that.

                                     SHELLY
                         What? You think I'm trying to compete 
                         with that? You think this joint's 
                         about bringing in the stroller crowd? 
                         Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride, 
                         looking to break the house on red 
                         and black. Fremont's never been about 
                         that bullshit. This is where old 
                         time and real money comes to play.

                                     LARRY
                         The numbers, they don't back you up, 
                         Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all 
                         love nostalgia -- but it belongs in 
                         a museum. I think it's time to decide 
                         whether you're running a museum or a 
                         casino.

               Shelly is close to losing it. He catches himself, takes a 
               breath.

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, forget about it. We'll talk 
                         later. Over dinner.

                                     MARTY
                              (rubs his hands 
                              together)
                         So, how's the action?

               Larry shoots him a disapproving look. Off Shelly's disturbed 
               expression. He's already calculating serious damage control.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie makes his way across the casino floor, when he's 
               intercepted by Shelly.

                                     SHELLY
                         Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment?

                                     BERNIE
                         I was just heading over to --

                                     SHELLY
                         It can wait.

               Shelly escorts Bernie over to a nearby bar area. The BARTENDER 
               zips over with some drinks.

                                     SHELLY
                         How's the knee?

               Bernie shrugs. Natalie steps up to the bar a few feet away.

               Puts in a drink order. She catches Bernie's eye. Nods.

               Bernie smiles.

                                     SHELLY
                         I was speaking to this orthopedic 
                         surgeon over at Vegas Memorial. He 
                         tells me they can replace a man's 
                         entire kneecap with titanium. It's 
                         the kinda thing that costs a shitload, 
                         but since the man's into us for five 
                         hundred large, I'm sure we could --

                                     BERNIE
                              (stealing glances at 
                              Natalie)
                         I told you, I'm not gonna be around 
                         after Sunday.

                                     SHELLY
                              (sighs)
                         Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where 
                         the fuck are you gonna go that's 
                         better'n here? I got you covered in 
                         this town. People, they know you 
                         work for me, that's currency in your 
                         pocket. That's fuckin' respect when 
                         you walk the floor. Where you gonna 
                         get that anyplace else?

                                     BERNIE
                              (sighs)
                         Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and 
                         I'm out from under.

               A beautiful WOMAN in a low cut dress, sashays her way past 
               them, heading for a high rollers craps table. Shelly reaches 
               out, napkin in hand, grabs her arm. Hands her his card. She 
               snatches it, looks it over. Immediately loses all attitude.

               Oh shit.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's right. I like to know who's 
                         shopping it in my neighborhood. You 
                         wanna keep working the Shangri-la, 
                         you come see me tomorrow morning in 
                         my office. We'll go over the rules 
                         together. And before you come, you 
                         bring me a clean bill of health. OK?

               The hooker just nods.

                                     SHELLY
                         All right, get outta here.

               She takes off. At the same time Natalie leaves with her drink 
               order. They walk in the same direction. Shelly mistakes 
               Bernie's wandering look for interest in the hooker.

                                     SHELLY
                         You want that, Bernie? She's yours. 
                         Anytime. I'll keep a tab running for 
                         you.
                              (Bernie shakes his 
                              head)
                         What's a matter? Not your type?

               Bernie just stares after Natalie, Shelly finally picking up 
               on it.

                                     BERNIE
                         Things are getting hot on fourteen. 
                         I gotta go.

               He limps off. Shelly stares after him. A predator seizing up 
               his prey. Calculating.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie's 1958 Buick Electra pulls into the parking lot of a 
               flea-bag motel. Next door to the motel, we see a convenience 
               store with the name, THE EZ MARK in pink glowing neon. It's 
               actually supposed to read: The EZ MARKET, but the last two 
               letters of "Market" have burned out.

               INT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

               One of those center pool style motels. A hard luck oasis, if 
               ever there was one.

               As Bernie limps toward his room, his neighbor, a low rent 
               HOOKER, approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard 
               with a huge-ass JOHN in tow.

               They converge at their doors at the same time. There's a 
               weariness about the hooker that's endemic to this town. She 
               winks at Bernie. He nods at her. Then casts a furtive glance 
               over at the John. The man flips him off. The hooker mouths, 
               "Sorry." Bernie hastily enters his apartment.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie flips on the light. A dim overhead bulb hardly makes 
               a dent in the gloomy surroundings. Typical drab motel 
               furnishings.

               We notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to 
               the window. A single place setting on the counter. Something 
               odd: an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor. No 
               sign of a cat. Go figure.

               Bernie heads over to the dresser. A half-filled bottle of 
               gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side.

               He pours himself a shot. Turns on the TV. A religious channel. 
               Shitty reception.

               ON SCREEN:

               an Appalachian Pentecostal service. The members of the 
               congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious 
               hysteria, while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits 
               viewer donations.

               Bernie doesn't even try to change the channel. He takes a 
               seat on his bed, props himself up against a pair of pillows, 
               stretches out.

               From next door, the sounds of wild humping.

                                     HOOKER (O.S.)
                         ...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh 
                         yeah, that's the spot... Do it to me 
                         harder, you big stud... Oooooh...

               Bernie closes his eyes, tries to ignore the X-rated soundtrack 
               coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls.

               The hooker's moans are starting to get to him. He raises his 
               fist to the wall, then stops himself. He's just not the 
               confrontational type.

               Instead, he heads over to the TV, cranks the volume up. The 
               hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with 
               the grunting and groaning from next door, making for a bizarre 
               remix that could only exist in the world of Bernie Lootz. 
               Bernie emits a deep sigh, closes his eyes.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Big action at the craps tables tonight. The players cheer as 
               MR. PINKERTON makes another pass. He exudes USED CAR SALESMAN.

               Natalie arrives with his drink.

                                     NATALIE
                         Seven and Seven?

               Pinkerton reaches for the drink without taking his eyes off 
               the table. He throws a hard six. The crowd cheers again.

               He turns around, stuffs a hundred dollar chip down her shirt 
               and slyly cops a feel.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Thanks, dollface.

               Natalie shudders in disgust. She spins around to leave... 
               runs smack into Bernie, spilling her tray of drinks on him.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz.

               Bernie wipes himself off, helps her pick up the pieces.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's all right. Happens.

               Natalie tries to wipe him down a bit more.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands, 
                         you know...

                                     BERNIE
                         S'okay. You might want to stick 
                         around.

               Bernie wiggles his way next to Pinkerton. He gives the 
               stickman a certain look.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have 
                         no hard eight.

                                     PINKERTON
                              (throwing in a chip)
                         Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight.

               Bernie just watches as Pinkerton throws the dice.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Eight the hard way!

               The players go nuts. The stickman taps the felt in front of 
               the shooter.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Parlay! Parlay!

               The Boxman seated at the center looks up at him.

                                     PINKERTON
                         C'mon. You can take that action.

               The Boxman feigns concern, then nods in approval.

                                     PINKERTON
                         That's what I'm talking about. None 
                         of this low limit bullshit.

               Just as the stickman feeds Pinkerton the dice, Bernie flips 
               a dollar chip over toward the center of the table. Natalie 
               peers between them to catch a glimpse.

                                     BERNIE
                         Dollar hard eight.

               The chip lands on Pinkerton's parlayed bet. He releases the 
               dice from his stubby little fingers.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight 
                         comes down.

               The players cry out in defeat. Pinkerton grumbles to himself. 
               He fingers his rail of chips.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Five hundred dollar hard eight. And 
                         press my nine up two units.

               He throws in the chips. The croupier places his bets. The 
               dice are fed back to him. He throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Easy way eight! Eight easy!

               Pinkerton is fit to be tied. After a passing moment of clarity 
               he empties his entire rail.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Hard eight.

               The entire table stops down for a second.

                                     PLAYER (O.S.)
                         Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm.

               Pinkerton sets his dice carefully and lets them fly.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out!

               Pinkerton slams his fist down on the table. He turns to leave 
               the table to find Natalie smiling at him.

                                     PINKERTON
                         What the fuck you smiling at, bitch?

               Pinkerton starts to lose it. Security moves in, right on 
               time. Natalie shoots Bernie a satisfied look. He averts his 
               eyes shyly and limps away. She stares after him for a moment.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               BUDDY STAFFORD, the Paradise Lounge's star attraction, is 
               performing on stage. He's a poor man's Tony Bennett. Mid to 
               late 60's. A staple at the Paradise for the last 20 years.

               The singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor, 
               almost tripping over his microphone cable.

               Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, 
               delivering the requisite eye contact. When their companions 
               react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in 
               a boxer's defensive stance. It's classic Buddy Stafford 
               schtick.

               From somewhere across the lounge, an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN jumps 
               up and throws her panties at Buddy. Buddy catches them and 
               waves them in the air... just as another pair whizzes by...

               We PAN ACROSS to Shelly seated at his corner booth, in the 
               company of Nicky Fingers, Larry and Marty.

               TIGHT ON SHELLY as he focuses on Buddy. A smile threatens 
               his patented stoicism. He's flashing back on the old days.

               While Nicky and Marty are clearly enjoying Buddy's 
               performance, Larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes.

               We take on LARRY'S POV of Buddy --

               SLOW MOTION CLOSE-UPS of BUDDY SINGING. The MUSIC SLOWED 
               DOWN with the action, emphasizing Buddy's lack of energy.

               Sweat dripping off Buddy's forehead, splattering into tiny 
               jewels against his microphone. Buddy's tired eyes. Shaking 
               hands around the mic.

               SMASH CUT to real time APPLAUSE as Buddy reaches the end of 
               the song. Larry is the only one not clapping. RACK ACROSS to 
               Shelly as he picks up on this.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly approaches Buddy's dressing room. He enters without 
               knocking...

               INT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               ...to find a trembling Buddy hunched over on a sofa, hugging 
               himself. Buddy immediately sits up...

                                     BUDDY
                         Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment 
                         tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me 
                         into going on.
                              (massages his throat)
                         It's definitely strep.

                                     SHELLY
                         You were velvet out there, pops. 
                         Silk.

               Shelly throws a pair of red silk panties to Buddy. We see a 
               room number scribbled on the crotch area.

                                     SHELLY
                         They were hanging on the door outside. 
                         Forget your tonsils. When the muff 
                         confetti stops coming, that's when 
                         you got yourself a problem.

                                     BUDDY
                              (dangling the panties 
                              on his finger)
                         You get a receipt?

                                     SHELLY
                         Excuse me?

                                     BUDDY
                         Charmayne's in the lobby. They got 
                         these on sale in the window. Victoria 
                         Secret's Valentine's Collection. And 
                         the broad waiting in the room, what 
                         she set you back? Always Grade-A for 
                         Ol' Buddy.

                                     SHELLY
                         Are you kidding me? Gimme that.
                              (snatches the panties 
                              away from Buddy)
                         You don't fucking deserve this. All 
                         those ladies going home with a sweet 
                         breeze between their legs because 
                         you still do it for them and you're 
                         fingering me for some kinda Buddy 
                         Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you, 
                         old man.

               Shelly feigns as if he's leaving.

                                     BUDDY
                              (affectionately)
                         Get back here, you prick. Hand it 
                         over.

               Shelly throws the panties back at Buddy. Buddy just stares 
               at him with pained eyes, waiting for something else. Sweat 
               mirror balls his wrinkled forehead.

               Shelly nods. Removes a foil package from his pocket. Hands 
               it to Buddy. The singer rushes over to his dressing table.

               Unwraps his works. Rubber tubes his forearm. Trembling hands 
               juggle lighter and hypodermic.

               Shelly takes a seat on the sofa. Buddy, euphoric as the dope 
               hits the spot. Tears in his eyes. He picks up on Shelly's 
               somber expression in the mirror.

                                     BUDDY
                         Whassimatter, kid? You got that 
                         Nostradamus look.

               Shelly shakes his head.

                                     BUDDY
                         You ever watch those nature shows on 
                         TV?

               Shelly shakes his head.

                                     BUDDY
                         I've seen this one a dozen times. 
                         It's about lions. Cycle of life thing. 
                         The leader of the pack...

                                     SHELLY
                         Pride. It's called a pride.

                                     BUDDY
                         Yeah, pride. The leader of the 
                         pride... when he gets on in years. 
                         It's just a matter of time before 
                         some young male arrives on the scene 
                         to challenge him. They go at it and 
                         the old cat gets the crap beaten 
                         outta him. It's humiliating. In front 
                         of all the females, this goes down. 
                         And after he's defeated, he's cast 
                         out of the pride, to scavenge and 
                         die alone in the bush.

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense 
                         of humor.

                                     BUDDY
                         No shit. It's fucking tragic because 
                         the old lion can't figure it out on 
                         his own. That he's past it. It'd be 
                         so much easier for him to just walk 
                         away and save himself all that pain 
                         and humiliation.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's like admitting to yourself 
                         that you're already dead. I prefer 
                         nature's way.

                                     BUDDY
                              (a beat)
                         Yeah. Me, too.

               Shelly holds Buddy's gaze in the mirror.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly exits the dressing room, to find Larry waiting on 
               him.

               He's accompanied by a good looking YOUNG MAN.

                                     LARRY
                         Shelly, got a minute...

               Shelly's expression: no. But he heads over anyway.

                                     LARRY
                         Shelly, this is Johnny Capella.

                                     JOHNNY
                         How ya doin', Shelly?

               Johnny extends his hand. Shelly ignores the gesture.

                                     SHELLY
                         I know you from somewhere, right?

                                     LARRY
                         Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz 
                         at the Mirage. Sony's talking about 
                         signing him to a three album deal. 
                         They're positioning him as the new 
                         Ricki Martin.

                                     SHELLY
                         And I should be interested in this, 
                         why?

                                     LARRY
                         Johnny's looking to headline. I told 
                         him we might be interested.

                                     SHELLY
                              (icy)
                         We?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Hey, if this is a bad time...

                                     SHELLY
                         Even if I were interested, Buddy's 
                         got ink with us through 2003. I just 
                         renegotiated his contract last year.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Sounds like the two of you need to 
                         get on the same page.
                              (to Larry)
                         If I don't hear from you by Thursday, 
                         I'm taking the Stardust's offer.

               Johnny nods at Shelly, takes off. Shelly and Larry eyeball 
               each other for a long, cold beat. Shelly's about to say 
               something, when Nicky and Marty approach. Larry shrugs, 
               flashes a chilling smile.

                                     NICKY
                         Where's Buddy? I wanna buy the old 
                         fart a drink.

                                     SHELLY
                         Buddy asked me to send you his 
                         regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so 
                         great. I think he's got that stomach 
                         flu that's going around.

                                     NICKY
                         Oh yeah? That's too bad.
                              (Shelly isn't fooling 
                              him)
                         Well, another time then.

                                     MARTY
                         Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be 
                         able to hook us up with some 
                         showgirls. Something with class.

               Shelly eyeballs Marty for a tense, extended beat. What do I 
               look like, some fuckin' pimp, college boy? Just as Marty's 
               starting to get real uncomfortable, Shelly cracks a smile.

                                     SHELLY
                         Sure, no problem. You got any 
                         preferences?

                                     NICKY
                              (jumps in)
                         Yeah. Something with big headlights, 
                         nice rims and low mileage.

                                     MARTY
                         You got any Asian babes?

               Shelly looks to Larry.

                                     LARRY
                         I think I'll just stick with the 
                         tables.

               We linger on Shelly's unsettled look. This guy is bad news.

               EXT. SHANGRI-LA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Bernie weaves his way through the lot to his car. Arriving 
               at his Buick, he's startled to find Natalie leaning against 
               it. She holds up the $100 chip the drunk tipped her.

                                     NATALIE
                         Buy you a drink?

               Off of Bernie's surprised expression...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

               Cheesy Polynesian decor. Mood lighting = an excuse to keep 
               the electric down. Basically, a joint where people come to 
               lose themselves.

               Natalie and Bernie are seated in a booth near the back. She 
               sips on an umbrella drink; he's nursing his usual gin.

               Natalie has an astrological chart in front of her. In between 
               sips, she makes annotations to the chart.

                                     NATALIE
                              (almost to herself)
                         Your Progressed Venus is Gemini, 
                         12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion. 
                         Which tells me that you're a slow 
                         starter when it comes to romance.
                              (off Bernie's taken 
                              aback expression)
                         You know what? This is real 
                         unprofessional of me. I shouldn't 
                         discuss your chart with you until 
                         I'm all done. I can tell by that 
                         look, you think this is all a lot of 
                         B.S.

                                     BERNIE
                         No... I just know what the outcome's 
                         going to be.

                                     NATALIE
                         The outcome? There's not, like, one 
                         particular outcome. A lot of things 
                         enter into it. The planets, moon 
                         phases...

                                     BERNIE
                         The outcome won't change with me. 
                         It'll be all bad.

                                     NATALIE
                         God, I have never met anyone who was 
                         so down on themselves. I used to be 
                         down on myself, OK? I don't go there 
                         anymore. I've got just three more 
                         correspondence classes with this 
                         stuff, then I'll have my certificate 
                         and everything. And you know how I 
                         got OK?

                                     BERNIE
                              (deadpan)
                         You had your chart done.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yes, as a matter of fact that is 
                         perfectly correct.

                                     BERNIE
                         Do you know what I do at the Shangri-
                         la?

                                     NATALIE
                         I asked around. You're a "cooler." 
                         You turn winners into losers.

                                     BERNIE
                         And do you know how I do that?

                                     NATALIE
                         I know there's stuff that goes on in 
                         casinos all the time --

                                     BERNIE
                         I do it by being myself. People get 
                         next to me and their luck turns. 
                         It's always been that way.

                                     NATALIE
                         That sounds to me like a self 
                         fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole 
                         chapter on that in my course. Anyways, 
                         I can see a big factor in your life 
                         is that you're lacking companionship. 
                         There's nobody to deflect off. If 
                         you've got, as you put it, bad karma, 
                         then you need someone with good karma 
                         to neutralize it. Well, that's my 
                         take on it anyway.

               Bernie maintains eye contact with Natalie for an extended 
               beat. Then drops his head, gazes at his glass.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't know about you, but I'm real 
                         tired.

               Natalie nods. Bernie motions to stand. Natalie just remains 
               seated. Keeps talking.

                                     NATALIE
                         I have this recurring dream where 
                         I'm on some beautiful island in the 
                         Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach, 
                         taking in this amazing sunset with 
                         one of these in my hand
                              (gestures to her drink)
                         ...and then it starts to rain. And I 
                         wake up and it's my roof leaking on 
                         me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie.

                                     BERNIE
                              (not even sure why 
                              he's telling her 
                              this)
                         I only got six more days. Well, almost 
                         five really. Then I'll be leaving 
                         town.

                                     NATALIE
                         Only five more days?
                              (a beat)
                         Then we shouldn't waste any more 
                         time.

               Natalie covers Bernie's hand with hers.

                                     NATALIE
                         Why don't we go back to your place?

                                     BERNIE
                              (completely caught 
                              off-guard)
                         I, uh... If this is... I don't know... 
                         I don't know if I can afford...

               Natalie flinches slightly. Then swiftly regains her composure. 
               It's Vegas. An honest mistake.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't 
                         mean... You see -- that's exactly 
                         what I'm talking about. I've gone 
                         and "cooled" the damn table.

                                     NATALIE
                         Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't 
                         gone and cooled anything. Not by a 
                         long shot.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Natalie's hand flips on the television. Another bizarre 
               religious service. We pull back from the screen as she tries 
               to change the channel. Just gets a whole lot of static.

               Bernie's standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room.

                                     NATALIE
                         You should complain about this.

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry, 
                         all I got's gin.

                                     NATALIE
                         Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead.

               Bernie walks over to the dresser, pours himself a shot.

               Natalie glances around. She notices Bernie's dead plants...

                                     NATALIE
                         You know, once they're dead, they 
                         don't really grow back. In case, 
                         that's what you're waiting for.

               Her eyes land on the empty cat bowl. She's about to say 
               something, when she picks up on Bernie's expression. Let's 
               not even go there. She gestures to an old record player in 
               the corner.

                                     NATALIE
                         So... got any music?

               Bernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards. Bare shelves... 
               except for a lone RECORD up on top. He brings it down. It's 
               a Sinatra album. Never been opened.

               Natalie looks on as Bernie meticulously removes the record 
               from its sleeve. He blows a few particles of dust from its 
               surface. Then delicately lays it on the turntable. The way 
               he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. With as much 
               care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon.

               Natalie can't help but smile.

               Bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record.

               Everything seems to be going so well, until...

               SKREEEEEE! The needle skids across the surface of the record 
               with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard.

               Bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delicious 
               laugh comes out.

               It's Natalie's laugh. Talk about a tension breaker. Bernie 
               turns to her, shrugs. He tries again. This time the needle 
               catches... and Sinatra takes command of the room. He's singing 
               "This Town," a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas. 
               Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch.

               Natalie summons Bernie over with her wagging forefinger. He 
               picks up his glass, shuffles over.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least 
                         one of us has done this before.

                                     BERNIE
                         This is not my first --

                                     NATALIE
                         Sssh. Surprise me.

               She starts massaging his shoulders, eliciting involuntary 
               moans from him. Bernie is almost in tears. Nobody's touched 
               him like this in years. And it shows.

               Natalie takes Bernie's glass, gulps down the remains herself, 
               then sets it on the floor. She drops down next to Bernie.

               Starts kissing him. Takes it slow.

                                     NATALIE
                         You're doing real good.

               They fall back onto the mattress. Natalie taking the reigns, 
               maneuvering her hips, kicking off her panties...

               Bernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt. A pair of 
               dice. Both twos.

               In seconds, Natalie has separated Bernie from his pants and 
               underwear, taking him inside of her, Ol' Blue Eyes keeping 
               the rhythm...

               Natalie moans uninhibitedly. Surprise: she's a real screamer. 
               Moments later, we hear banging from the hooker's side of the 
               wall. Some John telling them to keep it down.

               Bernie, with tears of elation in his eyes, thrusts away at 
               Natalie... for all of thirty seconds, before he explodes, 
               convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp.

               Frank winds down "This Town" a few seconds later. Poor Bernie, 
               he didn't even make it through the song.

                                     BERNIE
                         Sorry...

               Natalie wraps her arms around him.

                                     NATALIE
                         Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse. 
                         We'll try again later.

               Bernie rests his head on her breasts. Closes his eyes. We 
               hold on him. A few seconds pass... and he breaks into a smile.

               Fade to black.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               TIGHT on Bernie sleeping. He still has that goofy smile on 
               his lips. A beat or two later, he opens his eyes. We PULL 
               BACK to reveal that he's alone in the bed. No sign of Natalie.

               Bernie turns to the pillow next to him, buries his face in 
               it. Takes a deep breath. Moans at her scent. Ambrosia. He 
               still has his face in the pillow, sucking in deep breaths, 
               when Natalie steps out of the bathroom. Big smile.

                                     NATALIE
                         Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast?

               Bernie just looks up at her; replay on the goofy smile.

               Heaven.

                                     BERNIE (V.O.)
                         -- I did six months at Rikers for 
                         running numbers. It was Shelly's 
                         thing, but I took the rap for it.

               INT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Bernie and Natalie sit eating breakfast.

                                     BERNIE
                         After I get out, I call up Shelly 
                         and he tells me to come out here. I 
                         figure he's going to set me up good 
                         at the Shangri-la. But he tells me 
                         they got all these rules about casinos 
                         employing felons. So he gets me this 
                         gig doing telemarketing for one of 
                         their fronts -- trying to scam 
                         pensioners out of their retirement 
                         money. I lasted two weeks.

               As Bernie talks, Natalie spies a very PREGNANT GIRL (20's) 
               coming out of the restroom. Her eyes follow the girl back to 
               a table where a YOUNG MAN (20's) waits on her.

                                     BERNIE
                         Already, I was getting in deep. 
                         Finally it got so bad, I had to beg 
                         Shelly to take on my markers around 
                         town. That just bought me more time 
                         to keep losing. I put Shelly in an 
                         awkward position. I understand why 
                         he did what he did.
                              (taps his knee)

                                     NATALIE
                         He did that to you? What, he shot 
                         you?

                                     BERNIE
                         Baseball bat.
                              (off her cringing 
                              expression)
                         I got off easy.

                                     NATALIE
                         That's getting off easy?

                                     BERNIE
                         I was out of control.

                                     NATALIE
                         But he maimed you...

                                     BERNIE
                         Let me tell you something. I'm 
                         grateful for what he did.
                              (off her stunned look)
                         No kidding. Every time I get an urge 
                         to play off the clock -- to so much 
                         as drop a quarter in a slot -- I 
                         reach down and squeeze what's left 
                         of my cartilage. It's one helluva 
                         reminder.

                                     NATALIE
                         Jesus... I thought stuff like that 
                         didn't happen no more. Like that was 
                         just in the movies or something.

               Bernie holds her gaze her for a moment.

                                     BERNIE
                         Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a 
                         payment plan. Two years off the books 
                         at the Shangri-la, cooling tables. 
                         Five more days and I walk.

               Before Natalie can respond, we hear the pregnant girl start 
               to moan out loud. The waitress rushes over.

                                     PREGNANT GIRL
                              (clutching her belly)
                         Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor!

               The young man at the table rushes her to her feet, escorts 
               her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion. All this without 
               paying the bill.

               As they pass by Bernie and Natalie's table, the girl trips 
               over Natalie's purse. Bernie quickly helps her up. That's 
               when he notices the young man...

                                     BERNIE
                              (shocked)
                         Mikey?

                                     MIKEY
                         Bernie...

               There's a quick moment of confusion. Bernie feels a bit thrown 
               by it all.

               EXT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - DAY

               Bernie accompanies them out to their car at a quick step.

               Once out the door, the girl's contractions appear to have 
               subsided. Natalie walks with the girl to try and help.

                                     PREGNANT GIRL
                         I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks.

               Bernie pulls Mikey aside.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey? Is that...? You're not the...

                                     MIKEY
                              (nods)
                         Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs 
                         in the family. I guess you're gonna 
                         be a grandfather, Bernie.

               They reach the couple's car. A rusted out 1955 Ford Fairlaine. 
               By the looks of it, they've been living out of it.

                                     BERNIE
                         This you?

                                     MIKEY
                         Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways, 
                         we gotta be somewhere...

                                     BERNIE
                         How's your mom doing?

                                     MIKEY
                         I'm gonna pretend like you give a 
                         shit and tell you, she's getting by. 
                         As long as she's wasted.

               Bernie nods. He gazes past Mikey to the girl.

                                     MIKEY
                         Name's Charlene, in case you were 
                         wondering. Looks like she's carrying 
                         a whole litter in there, don't it?

                                     NATALIE
                         When was the last time you saw a 
                         doctor?

               Charlene sidles up alongside Mikey.

                                     CHARLENE
                         This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six 
                         months ago. I wasn't about to go 
                         back after they treated me like 
                         cattle. Just because I didn't have 
                         no insurance. And those places, 
                         they're crawling with T.B. from all 
                         'em spies.

                                     BERNIE
                         So, you're in town...?

                                     MIKEY
                         Maybe a week or so. Got some business 
                         to take care of.

                                     BERNIE
                         If you want, stop by the Lucky Star 
                         Motel. Give us a chance to catch up. 
                         I'm on three to eleven shift at the 
                         Shangri-la. I work the floor.

                                     MIKEY
                         No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah, 
                         maybe I'll do that. We can play catch 
                         up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split.

                                     NATALIE
                              (to Charlene)
                         Take care.

               Mikey helps Charlene into the front passenger seat. They 
               drive off. Natalie looks to Bernie. She's curious, but doesn't 
               ask. He appears thankful for that.

               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the 
               felt. We see the owner of the chips strike a match. His last 
               one. It fizzles out quickly. TILT UP to the PLAYER'S FACE 
               with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips.

               A hand quickly reaches in, lights the cigarette with a Zippo.

               PULL BACK to reveal Bernie.

                                     PLAYER
                         Thanks...

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't mention it.

               Bernie sits at the table.

                                     DEALER
                              (he knows the routine)
                         Hundred dollar minimum here, sir.

               Bernie peels off a hundred from his billfold. Lays it on the 
               felt.

                                     DEALER
                         Money plays one hundred.

                                     PLAYER
                              (to Bernie)
                         No offense, pal, but there's twenty 
                         other tables. What do you wanna come 
                         sit on my head for?

                                     BERNIE
                         Just wanna play one hand. Feeling 
                         lucky tonight. I got this voice in 
                         my head, says this is the table...

                                     PLAYER
                         I know this is the table. I'm already 
                         doing good here. It's my fucking 
                         table --

                                     BERNIE
                              (touching him)
                         Hey, heard the one about the fella 
                         walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who 
                         owns that big great dane outside?" A 
                         man at the end of the bar raises his 
                         hand. "I do." The fella says, "Yeah? 
                         Well, my dog just killed it."

               The dealer finishes shuffling, begins to deal.

                                     BERNIE
                         "Whaddya mean your dog just killed 
                         my great dane? What kinda dog you 
                         have?" The fella just shrugs and 
                         says, "A chihuahua." "You tellin' me 
                         your chihuahua just killed my great 
                         dane? How?"
                              (a beat)
                         "I dunno," the fella says, "I think 
                         he got stuck in his throat."

               Bernie starts laughing. The player is less than tickled.

               Just then the dealer interrupts them.

                                     DEALER
                         Insurance?

               We see the dealer's got an ace showing.

                                     PLAYER
                         God damnit!

               The player waves off the insurance, as does Bernie. The dealer 
               checks. Nothing. As the hand plays through the dealer busts 
               out. Bernie glances over at the dealer. What the hell? Bernie 
               places his chips again.

                                     PLAYER
                         You said, one hand.

                                     BERNIE
                              (agitated; to dealer)
                         Keep going.

               The dealer plays. Bernie and the high roller win again.

               Bernie glances around him uncomfortably. We see Shelly 
               approaching. Shelly just has a nose for when things aren't 
               running smoothly. Larry is lurking behind him.

               The dealer turns up some cards. And again, Bernie and the 
               high roller win. Bernie looks absolutely perturbed. Shelly 
               gestures something with his head. Bernie cashes out.

                                     PLAYER
                         Hey, stick around, pal. You and me, 
                         we make a great team.

               Bernie strolls over to Shelly. Shelly guides him away from 
               the table under Larry's watchful eye.

                                     SHELLY
                         What was that?

               Bernie shrugs, still confused.

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, what fucking gives? Is it 
                         McGann? He's been with us twelve 
                         years. The man's as standup as my 
                         dick.
                              (thinking to himself)
                         Maybe he's got money problems. I'm 
                         gonna pull him. He wasn't counting 
                         'em, was he? The mook with the streak?

               Bernie shakes his head. Larry sidles over.

                                     LARRY
                         Is there a problem?

                                     SHELLY
                              (zero tolerance)
                         No, there's no problem. Fella's on a 
                         streak, is all.

                                     LARRY
                              (re: Bernie)
                         Let me guess? This is one of your 
                         "coolers?"

                                     SHELLY
                         Why don't you announce it to the 
                         whole fucking joint?

                                     LARRY
                              (lowers his voice)
                         Man, they told me you were a stickler 
                         for the old ways. But coolers? What 
                         is this guy, some kind of degenerate 
                         gambler? Reformed card shark? He 
                         doesn't look too effective to me.

                                     SHELLY
                         He's the best. Take it from me.

                                     LARRY
                         Sure. Whatever. But there ways -- 
                         subtle ways -- to keep things in our 
                         favor. I'm talking more forward 
                         thinking methods.

                                     SHELLY
                         That right? I suppose you got a whole 
                         fucking prospectus on the subject.

                                     LARRY
                         As a matter of fact I do. Like, right 
                         off the bat, I can tell you this 
                         wallpaper isn't going to cut it. 
                         It's too uplifting. I would go with 
                         more muted tones.

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah? Wallpaper?

                                     LARRY
                         And personally, I think the waitresses 
                         can all pop another button or two. 
                         Myself, I wouldn't hire anything 
                         less than a C cup.

               Shelly looks to Bernie. You believe this mook? Larry extracts 
               a CD from his jacket...

                                     LARRY
                         Know what this is? Music to be sure. 
                         Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended 
                         in at a subsonic level is a mantra. 
                         "Lose... lose... lose." And that's 
                         just skimming the surface. We really 
                         need to talk, Shelly.

               Shelly is close to losing it. When MORRIE, the manager of 
               the Paradise, comes running up...

                                     MORRIE
                         Shelly, you better come quick.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Shelly, Larry and Bernie following behind Morrie as he hastily 
               leads them down a hallway of the Shangri-la's best suites. 
               They arrive at an open door, the sound of a TELEVISION 
               beckoning them inside...

               INT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Starting on the TV set: "Lost Horizon" (1937) is playing.

               It's the scene where Robert Conway (Ronald Coleman), his 
               brother and Maria are leaving the lost city in the end.

               Conway looks back for one last tearful view of paradise.

               PANNING OFF THE SCREEN to a pair of naked feet on the floor 
               next to the bed... revealing Buddy slumped against the side 
               of the mattress... a hypodermic needle protruding from his 
               arm. Death glaze fixated on the screen.

               Bernie slumps back against the wall. Catches his breath.

               Shelly just stares at Buddy, a slight tremor of grief 
               threatening his granite features. He glances over at Larry, 
               who takes in Buddy's deathly repose without a hint of emotion. 
               Larry meets Shelly's eye with a subtle smirk of one-upmanship.

               An incendiary beat passes between them. Then...

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Morrie)
                         Get a hold of his daughter. Assist 
                         her with the arrangements. The Shangri-
                         la will take care of everything.

                                     MORRIE
                         What about the Paradise?

                                     SHELLY
                         She goes dark tonight.

                                     LARRY
                         That won't be necessary.

               Shelly and Larry exchange looks again. Bernie picks up on 
               it. The tension in the room threatens nuclear fission. A 
               loud ANIMAL ROAR reverberates on the soundtrack...

               accompanied by jungle-like percussion... as we CUT TO:

               INT. THE PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               A "now performing" poster on a metal stand: JOHNNY CAPPELLA 
               live at the Paradise Lounge!

               PANNING off the sign and following a COUPLE through the doors 
               into the theater.

               ...our eye drawn to the stage. A troupe of gorgeous FEMALE 
               DANCERS in leopard print G-strings, grinding their hips to 
               the muscular rhythm.

               Flanking them are a pair of strutting LIONS in elevated cages.

               An EXPLOSION OF LIGHT and SMOKE... and JOHNNY CAPPELLA makes 
               his entrance. Decked out in a reflective suit that picks up 
               every light in the house and throws it back at the audience.

               Johnny's got the style of a Harry Connick Jr. and the moves 
               of Ricki Martin. The energy this guy brings to the stage 
               makes the last twenty years of Buddy Stafford's reign seem 
               like suspended animation. The women in the audience start 
               fanning themselves with delight.

               It's a new dawn in Paradise. And the panties are coming fast 
               and furious.

               We see Shelly watching from the back of the room. He shifts 
               his attention to Nicky, Larry and Marty at a primo table.

               They're having a grand time. Nicky pats Larry on the back of 
               the head. "Good work, kid."

               Larry turns and raises his drink to Shelly. Shelly stares 
               right through him. A declaration of war.

               INT. CASINO MIDWAY - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie wander around the midway. A middle-aged 
               WORKER at the ring toss booth gets her attention.

                                     RING TOSS WORKER
                         Over here, young lady! C'mon, give 
                         it a try. Eight for a dollar.

               Natalie drags Bernie over. She pays her money and the worker 
               hands her the rings. Natalie throws, and misses all eight.

               The man pats her on the shoulder.

                                     RING TOSS WORKER
                         Sorry there, sweetheart. Better luck 
                         next time. Wanna try again?

               Natalie is about to take him up on it, when she catches 
               Bernie's eye. His look suggests she's being played for a 
               sucker. She decides against it.

               They walk off down the midway. Bernie chuckles to himself.

                                     NATALIE
                         What?

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing.

                                     NATALIE
                         What?

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing. You're just an easy mark, 
                         is all.

                                     NATALIE
                         An easy mark?

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard 
                         that term?

               Natalie shakes her head.

                                     BERNIE
                         When we were kids, Shelly and me, we 
                         used to work Coney Island during the 
                         summer. When a guy would walk up and 
                         seemed eager to open his wallet, we 
                         would always mark him with chalk. 
                         We'd pat him on the back or arm with 
                         the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good 
                         job!'
                              (pats Natalie)
                         Meanwhile, he had no clue the other 
                         guys saw him coming a mile away. 
                         Easy mark.

               Natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted her.

               She brushes it for effect. Bernie smiles. They take a seat 
               at the end of the midway.

               Natalie locks onto a little toe-headed BOY being dragged 
               around by his OLDER BROTHER and the brother's FRIEND. The 
               kid has a glazed look in his eyes.

               Natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression. Bernie 
               picks up on it.

                                     BERNIE
                         You OK?

                                     NATALIE
                         You notice last night, that tattoo 
                         on my butt?

                                     BERNIE
                              (are you kidding?!)
                         Little Joe.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah, two twos. Little Joe.

               Natalie hides her face behind her soda cup. Looks off in the 
               distance.

                                     NATALIE
                         I had a son. His name was Joe. I was 
                         his mother for a year.

                                     BERNIE
                         You know, you don't have to tell me 
                         this.

                                     NATALIE
                         I want to, Bernie. Better you know 
                         the worst of me up front. Later, 
                         when I'm already invested in you, 
                         it'll be too hard to come clean. 
                         After I tell you this, you'll 
                         probably... I mean, I'll understand.

               She tears her eyes away from Bernie. Bernie can't believe 
               what he's hearing. That she wants to be invested in him.

               What could be so bad?

                                     NATALIE
                         I gave my son up for adoption. I 
                         just wanted my life back. I was 
                         seventeen going on eighteen and I 
                         was selfish. My family, they didn't 
                         want to have nothing to do with me 
                         after that. So I hitched a ride out 
                         here. Figured I could make it as a 
                         showgirl. Ten years later...
                              (shrugs; starts to 
                              break up)
                         I like to think that if it happened 
                         when I was older -- with some guy I 
                         cared about -- maybe things would 
                         have been different. I think about 
                         my Little Joe. And, I do know he's 
                         better off. I'm convinced of that.

               She lowers her soda. Turns to Bernie. He studies her for a 
               lengthy beat, stoic features. She wipes away her tears. Oh 
               well, that's that. Bernie stands up. Looks around... focuses 
               on the arcade clock. It reads 1:40 a.m. He turns to her...

                                     BERNIE
                         So, you wanna go try your hand at 
                         the dime pitch? It's early still.

               Off Natalie's tear-filled features. She breaks into a laugh-
               cry...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie making love. Slow, tender. Natalie doesn't 
               make with the "Oh yeah, baby, you're doing great" 
               encouragement. Just some low key moans. Bernie doesn't come 
               too soon either. He outlasts Sinatra through several cuts.

               In contrast, we hear the hooker and her John howling away 
               through the walls. An escalating ostinato of "Oh Baby's."

               Until Natalie reaches behind her and raps her fist against 
               the wall. Big smile from both of them.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY

               Bernie and Natalie returning from breakfast in Bernie's Buick. 
               Bernie can't find a parking spot. Natalie climbs out, heads 
               for the room.

               Natalie arrives at the room. She's about to stab the key in 
               the lock, when she realizes the door is ajar. She hesitates 
               for a moment, then pushes it open...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               ...to find Mikey and Charlene waiting on them. Charlene is 
               puffing away on a Marlboro when Natalie enters. She 
               immediately stubs it out. Rises, heads for the bathroom.

                                     CHARLENE
                         I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing.

               She closes the door after her.

                                     NATALIE
                              (to Mikey)
                         How did you get in here?

                                     MIKEY
                         I told the desk clerk Bernie was my 
                         old man. He let us wait inside. That 
                         a problem?

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie's looking for a parking space.

                                     MIKEY
                              (chuckles)
                         Shit. I musta taken the last one.

               Mikey steps up to Natalie. She hasn't moved from the doorway. 
               Her dislike for Mikey is evident.

                                     MIKEY
                         Tell me something, Natalie? Is he 
                         paying you?

                                     NATALIE
                         Excuse me?

                                     MIKEY
                         My old man, is he renting your ass? 
                         'Cause otherwise I just don't get 
                         it. A loser like my pops in the 
                         company of some primo T & A. It don't 
                         compute.

               Natalie doesn't dignify Mikey with an answer. She stares him 
               down unflinchingly. Mikey reaches out to Natalie's ear, 
               "pulls" out a $20 dollar chip.

                                     MIKEY
                         This enough to get me a taste? Family 
                         discount?

               He drops the chip down Natalie's cleavage. Natalie still 
               doesn't react. Mikey reaches up, starts caressing her face.

               She flinches. Right then, the door swings open. Bernie enters. 
               Mikey snaps his fingers and a rose appears in his hand. He 
               extends it to Natalie. She ignores the gesture, steps aside.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey...

                                     MIKEY
                         Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna 
                         stop by.

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah... I figured you'd call ahead. 
                         We were out at breakfast.

               Charlene emerges from the bathroom. Natalie heads over. She 
               doesn't want to be around Mikey.

               She stops in front of Charlene, points to a sprinkling of 
               white powder on the side of her nose.

                                     NATALIE
                         You missed some.

               Charlene immediately swats the coke off. Natalie enters the 
               bathroom. Closes the door.

                                     MIKEY
                         You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're 
                         kinda strapped. I mean, Charly here's 
                         expecting like yesterday, and we 
                         don't have the dough to make with 
                         the right nutrition for her an' all. 
                         So, I was wondering if you would 
                         care to invest a little in your 
                         grandchild's future... his well being.

               Bernie scratches his head, thinks on it for a moment or two.

               Then heads over to the kitchenette cupboard. Pulls down a 
               coffee can. Extracts a thick wad of bills. Hands them over 
               to Mikey.

                                     BERNIE
                         There's about three grand there. 
                         That's all I got.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Bless you, Bernie.
                              (pats her belly)
                         You know, Michael, I  -- think we 
                         should name her Bernadette. After 
                         your father.

                                     MIKEY
                         You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it's a 
                         boy.

               Bernie seems quite moved by it all.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (to Bernie)
                         Wanna feel her?

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think... I don't want anything 
                         to hap...

                                     CHARLENE
                         Ooh, I just felt her kick. C'mon, 
                         Bernie, gimme your hand...

               She places Bernie's hand over her stomach.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Feel that?

                                     BERNIE
                              (not sure)
                         I don't know... I think so...

               Mikey takes Charlene by the arm...

                                     MIKEY
                         We'll catch you later, Bernie. I 
                         think I'm gonna take Charly over to 
                         the hospital right now. Get her 
                         checked up real good.

               Charlene kisses Bernie on the cheek. He blushes.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Take care, Pop.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey...

               Mikey turns in the doorway, eyebrows raised. Yeah?

                                     BERNIE
                         You're not going to try anything 
                         stupid while you're in town?

               Mikey plays it dumb. Huh?

                                     BERNIE
                         You mess up and they'll cut you no 
                         slack. That's all I'm saying. You 
                         got a kid to think about.

               Mikey nods, backs out of the room. Charlene giggles. They 
               disappear into the parking lot. Natalie emerges from the 
               bathroom. She lights up a cigarette, just stares at him as 
               if to say: sucker. Bernie shrugs.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Shelly enters to find Larry seated behind his desk. Larry 
               immediately leaps to his feet, phony apologetic grin.

               Nicky and Marty are lounging on Shelly's sofa. Shelly's gaze 
               is drawn to a table in the middle of the room. There's 
               something on it, covered in a plastic sheet. He raises a 
               "what gives?" eyebrow.

                                     NICKY
                         Shelly, I hope you don't mind...

                                     SHELLY
                         What's going on, Nicky?

                                     NICKY
                         I'm sorry we didn't say nothing about 
                         this earlier... but the deal wasn't 
                         closed yet.

                                     MARTY
                         Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna 
                         love it.

               Nicky gestures to Larry. Larry whisks the plastic sheet off 
               the table...

               ...to reveal an impressive SCALE MODEL of a redesigned SHANGRI-
               LA HOTEL AND CASINO.

               The model boasts huge snow-capped Himalayan peaks a la "Lost 
               Horizon," surrounding a completely overhauled hotel and 
               casino. A Matterhorn-like rollercoaster traverses the mountain 
               top. Gold and marbled pillars, terraces and floors promise 
               to raise the bar on Las Vegas opulence. We're looking at a 
               hundred million dollar investment easy.

                                     NICKY
                         The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino. 
                         We break ground on her in six months.

               Off Shelly's startled expression --

                                     NICKY
                         I know what you're thinking? Where's 
                         she gonna go? You need space to 
                         expand, right? Well, that's been 
                         taken care of. We're now the proud 
                         owners of The Golden Frontier next 
                         door.

                                     LARRY
                              (gesturing to the 
                              model)
                         She's perfect. Three floors of gaming, 
                         IMAX theater, entertainment center, 
                         boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster, 
                         you name it. She'll pay for herself 
                         in three years, and then it's easy 
                         money.

                                     NICKY
                         Isn't she great, Shell?

               Shelly slowly approaches the model like a condemned prisoner 
               mounting the scaffolding.

               We see his stoic features reflected in her sparkling swimming 
               pool.

                                     SHELLY
                         In "Lost Horizon," these people, 
                         their plane crashes in the Himalayas -- 
                         and they get rescued and taken to 
                         this Utopia in the mountains. Shangri-
                         la. It's beautiful. The place is 
                         completely isolated. Untouched by 
                         the outside world. There's no war, 
                         no greed, no bullshit... Time is 
                         slowed down. People, they don't age. 
                         It's... paradise. That's what Shangri-
                         la is. Paradise.

                                     LARRY
                         Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And 
                         your point is?

               Shelly whirls around, yells:

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't fuck with paradise! All'a 
                         ya!

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, Jesus, c'mon, Shelly. We're not 
                         trying to fuck with it. We're trying 
                         to make it better.

                                     SHELLY
                         How... how, Nicky, could it be any 
                         better? Right now it's perfect. It's 
                         the last of its kind. It's pure... 
                         and this.
                              (points to the model; 
                              weary)
                         ...this is just... it's a mockery. 
                         An insult. Trying to make something 
                         of it that it isn't.

                                     LARRY
                         What are you talking about? It's 
                         right outta the movie?

                                     SHELLY
                         Whose talking about a fuckin' movie? 
                         This ain't a fuckin' movie. This is 
                         my life. This is my house of worship. 
                         You people are shittin' on all that's 
                         sacred to me.

               A tense silence ensues. Nicky, Larry and Marty exchange looks.

                                     SHELLY
                              (tired laugh)
                         I got just one question? Where you 
                         gonna be when they decide to change 
                         it back? When the people, they come 
                         looking for the real Vegas, from 
                         before all this Epcott Center 
                         bullshit. Who's gonna it give it to 
                         them? You guys? I don't think so. 
                         You know who? The same fucks who 
                         started this shit in the first place. 
                         It's all gonna come full circle and 
                         bite you in the ass. Mark my words.

               Shelly falls silent. Massages his forehead. Shit, that wasn't 
               the way to handle it.

               Nicky gets up from the sofa, walks over to Shelly, places a 
               hand on his shoulder. Shelly flinches, but doesn't pull away.

                                     NICKY
                         You make some good points, Shelly. 
                         Maybe it'll swing back the other 
                         way, who knows? But the smart money 
                         suggests we roll the dice. I'm not 
                         gonna bullshit you; naturally there's 
                         gonna be a lot of restructuring in 
                         the months to come, but I want you 
                         to know, you'll always have a place 
                         with us.

                                     SHELLY
                         Where's that? Behind the bar?

                                     MARTY
                              (laughs)
                         Behind the bar, that's a good one.

                                     NICKY
                         I think you should take some time 
                         and think things through. All this, 
                         it's a lot to digest, y'know.

                                     MARTY
                         Speaking of things to digest, I'm 
                         starving. How's that buffet they got 
                         in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You 
                         recommend their prime rib, Shell?

               Shelly stares right through Marty. Choke and die on it, 
               motherfucker.

                                     SHELLY
                         It's food.

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, my arteries can use a workout. 
                         Lead us to the trough, Shell.

               Shelly nods at Nicky, then shifts his gaze to Larry. Larry's 
               all smiles. He steps forward to join them, his hand dropping 
               down and caressing the surface of Shelly's desk behind him.

               A subtle gesture not lost on Shelly. Shelly mentally unloads 
               a full chamber into Larry's chest. Returns the smile.

               INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               As Shelly and the group pass a hot craps table, Nicky is 
               drawn to it.

                                     NICKY
                         Wait up a second...

                                     MARTY
                         I thought we were gonna eat?

               Only now do we see Bernie has arrived to cool the table of 
               its hot shooter -- A LOUD, pudgy, overdressed SUBURBANITE.

               Shelly eyes Bernie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Maybe we wanna play over there. Less 
                         crowded.

                                     NICKY
                         Nah, let's play here. This is my 
                         lucky table. I always play here.
                              (to the others)
                         Go on ahead. I know where to find 
                         you guys.

               Shelly signals Bernie to back off. Bernie steps back.

               Shelly, Larry and Marty head for the restaurant. Nicky quickly 
               slaps down some green.

               The stickman slides the dice over to the suburbanite who is 
               shooting. He scuttles the dice. They bounce up over the rail 
               and spike Nicky on the forehead before dropping back on the 
               felt. The players chuckle.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Out! Seven, line away seven...

               Nicky rubs his forehead, glares at the suburbanite. He fires 
               back.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         C"mon, pops! What the hell? I coulda 
                         paid my mortgage with the money I 
                         just lost.

               Nicky says nothing. The table is quickly cleared by the 
               dealers. The stickman skips the next shooter and feeds the 
               dice to Nicky.

                                     SHOOTER
                         Hey? I'm supposed to be next...

                                     NICKY
                         File a grievance, shithead.

               Suburbanite is still fuming over his loss. Nicky places a 
               couple hundred on the passline.

                                     STICKMAN
                         We're coming out. Crap Eleven, any 
                         seven.

               Nicky throws in some chips to the center.

                                     NICKY
                         Hundred dollar big red.

               Suburbanite watches as Nicky runs through a lengthy pre-shot 
               routine. Lots of hand jive and cuff shooting.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Hurry it up, gramps. Your soup's 
                         getting cold.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down.

               The croupiers takes down the pass line.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try 
                         shuffleboard.

               Nicky is fed the dice again. Same routine. Nicky just fires 
               an incendiary look back at the suburbanite.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Uncle Palsy? Shake'em this direction.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Four, hard four. The point is four.

               The players make their bets.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Good now throw it before you fucking 
                         keel over and die, old man.

               Nicky slowly starts his routine defiantly.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday 
                         to me... Jesus, fuck, I'm another 
                         year older already.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         OUT! Seven! Line away.

               Nicky claps his hands dealer style -- for effect -- and with 
               a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table. Nicky's chips 
               are quickly swept up by the croupier.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Don't take it so hard, pops. Everybody 
                         craps out.

               Nicky locks eyes with the suburbanite. Then flashes a smile 
               that suggests he's going to brush it off. He turns away from 
               the table...

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Now go change your fucking Depends.

               Nicky makes like it's all in good jest. Yeah, that's real 
               cute. He heads around the table to the suburbanite, holds 
               out his hand as if to say: Hey, no hard feelings. The 
               suburbanite shrugs. What the fuck? I was just playing with 
               you, pops. He reaches for Nicky's hand... when Nicky suddenly 
               headbutts him. Before anyone can react, Nicky starts laying 
               into the suburbanite. The man goes down and.

               Nicky continues pummeling him...

                                     NICKY
                         Who's laughing now, huh? ya fuckin! 
                         prick! C'mon, crack wise again... Ya 
                         fuckin' smooth as a Ken doll, no-
                         dick, suburbanite scum. How's that 
                         for a game?!

               Shelly alerted to the fracas, rushes back to the table. He 
               takes immediate control of the situation. Snaps his fingers 
               at security. The suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful 
               of comps and a bruised ego. Shelly takes Nicky aside, attempts 
               to calm him. Nicky keeps railing at Shelly:

                                     NICKY
                         That ain't right, Shelly! Guy fucks 
                         up my game like that. Who the fuck 
                         does he think he is?

                                     SHELLY
                         You're right. He's just a piece of 
                         shit. Forget about him.

                                     NICKY
                         I thought this joint had more class. 
                         Used to be, we wouldn't even let 
                         bums like that in...

               Nicky catches himself. He looks at Shelly for a beat.

               There's an unspoken understanding between them. "The good 
               old days." We see Bernie in the b.g., looking more than a 
               bit shocked.

               INT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

               Bernie seated with Natalie.

                                     BERNIE
                         This town... You know, Natalie, all 
                         I want to do is go some place where 
                         I can tell day from night. Where 
                         they got clocks on the wall. I can't 
                         breathe around here no more. Four 
                         days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure 
                         I can hold out that long.

                                     NATALIE
                              (a beat)
                         So where does that leave us?

                                     BERNIE
                         A week ago, I didn't remember what 
                         it was like to have a woman's hands 
                         on me. I'm still pinching myself, 
                         expecting to wake-up from...
                              (just blurts it out)
                         Come with me, Natalie. I want you to 
                         come with me.

                                     NATALIE
                         God, Bernie, that's...

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring 
                         that on you.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie... I want to be with you. I 
                         do. But I don't know if I can leave 
                         with you.

               Bernie's look: Why?

                                     NATALIE
                         I was working on a compatibility 
                         chart for the two of us. And it looks 
                         good, really, it does.

                                     BERNIE
                         So, what's the problem?

                                     NATALIE
                         That's with us here. In Vegas.

               Bernie's expression: Oh.

                                     NATALIE
                         Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause 
                         I knew you were leaving... and I 
                         tried working it in different ways... 
                         It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared. 
                         But that's just for now, for the 
                         immediate future. Once the planets 
                         realign, maybe a year from now...

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie... I can't... Not another 
                         year. Not another week.

               A somber mood falls on the table. Bernie reaches for Natalie's 
               hand. Instead, he knocks the salt over. It spills out in 
               front of them.

                                     BERNIE
                         I think... we probably shouldn't see 
                         each other anymore.

                                     NATALIE
                         Why, Bernie? We only got a couple 
                         days left together. Why not make the 
                         most of them?

                                     BERNIE
                              (a long beat)
                         Because if I spend one more night in 
                         your arms, I'm not going anywhere.

                                     NATALIE
                         And that's so bad?

               Bernie just stares at her, shrouded in sadness. Natalie stubs 
               out her cigarette, rises.

                                     NATALIE
                         Take care, Bernie.

               Bernie casts his eyes to the mound of spilled salt in front 
               of him. Nods. A few beats later he raises his head...

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie, don't...

               Gone. A WAITRESS appears.

                                     WAITRESS (O.S.)
                         Get you another?

                                     BERNIE
                              (nods)
                         I think you better bring me the 
                         bottle. Please.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO/BAR - NIGHT

               Once again, we see Bernie's feet limp across the casino floor. 
               He walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of coffee.

               Doris brings it over. Short on the cream again.

               He just sips it black. Gloom and doom features. Life sucks.

               His master's VOICE sounds over the intercom:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Chang, party of fifteen, your table 
                         is ready, Chang party of fifteen.

               Bernie looks to Doris. Sighs. Only three more days.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               He heads for the crap tables, the sound of raucous CHEERING 
               becomes audible. A large crowd starting to gather.

               Bernie noodles his way to the front of the crowd. As soon as 
               he gets a look at the heavy hitter at the table, he tenses 
               up.

               Oh shit.

               It's MIKEY. With Charlene. Charlene is making one hell of a 
               racket. Playing up her extremely maternal state.

               Just then Natalie sidles up to Bernie with the Chivas Regal.

               Without thinking about it, he grabs the glass off the tray, 
               downs it in a single gulp.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (clutching her tummy)
                         Come on, Mikey. This is our future. 
                         Don't blow it.

               Mikey throws down a bet for the dealer.

                                     MIKEY
                         Put this on the line for the boys.

               The stickman thanks him as they place the bet. Mikey throws 
               down more money. We can see Mikey has bets all over the table.

                                     MIKEY
                         With shoes!

                                     STICKMAN
                         Dealer's got shoes. Hands high, the 
                         dice are out! The point is nine.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Come on all you's. Put a good thought 
                         in for our baby!

               As everyone dotes over Charlene, Mikey quickly swaps the 
               dice before anyone can see. He throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six the hard way!

               Mikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier, as is Charlene.

               Bernie stands frozen. He doesn't bother trying to get any 
               closer to the table. He knows it'll do no good.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He 
                         knows. He knows you're all pulling 
                         for him. God bless you all.

               Natalie looks over at Charlene. Their eyes meet for a second. 
               It's as though Natalie knows it's a scam and Charlene's 
               acknowledging it.

               Mikey throws again.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six the hard way! Look out, we got a 
                         shooter!

               Another nine grand. Mikey's rail is nearly full. Charlene 
               hops around awkwardly causing more distraction.

               Bernie is really sweating it out now. Then Shelly arrives.

               Larry is hot on his tail.

                                     SHELLY
                         How much?

                                     BERNIE
                         Eighteen thousand since I stepped 
                         up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've 
                         been hit and miss lately.

               Shelly's expression tells us he isn't so sure. Something 
               definitely isn't kosher.

               As Charlene chatters on, Mikey switches the dice back.

               Shelly makes him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (sotto)
                         Fucking amateurs...

               Mikey throws...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out! Line away.

               The players and crowd, though disappointed, applaud Mikey's 
               achievement.

                                     MIKEY
                              (bowing)
                         I thank you. My wife thanks you. My 
                         unborn child thanks you.

               Mikey moves his rail of chips to the felt.

                                     MIKEY
                         Color me up will ya?

               Larry notices Shelly slipping on a pair of leather gloves.

                                     LARRY
                         You've gotta be kidding me.
                              (off Shelly's steely 
                              glare)
                         That's not how I propose we handle 
                         it. We'll turn the matter over to 
                         the authorities. They'll be 
                         blacklisted, their credit ruined...

                                     SHELLY
                              (gets in Larry's face)
                         And then we'll give 'em both a 
                         lollipop for the ride home. Come 
                         watch and learn, Harvard. A little 
                         lesson on how to protect your 
                         investment -- the old school way.

               Shelly walks over to Mikey and Charlene, Larry lingering 
               behind him.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, that was some run you had back 
                         there.

                                     MIKEY
                         Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess.

               Mikey steals a tense glance at Charlene. She starts to fidget 
               nervously.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why don't we go do this in my office? 
                         I don't like to hand out all this 
                         amount of cash on the floor.

               Security (Tony and Lou) corrals the couple. Leads them away.

               Bernie watches as they pass by. Mikey looks into Bernie's 
               eyes. They both know he's been made. Natalie doesn't say 
               anything, just looks at Bernie.

               INT. CASINO RECEIVING AREA - NIGHT

               Slot machines everywhere -- some on the way out, some on the 
               way in. Crates of casino supplies.

               Bernie rushes in with Natalie behind him. Heading for an 
               aural beacon of BLOWS landing on flesh... GRUNTING, 
               PLEADING...

               ...arriving to find Tony and Lou kicking the shit out of 
               Mikey on the floor. Charlene lies clutching her belly a few 
               feet away. Shelly swings a baseball bat, warming up for some 
               blood sport. Larry watches from the sidelines -- at once 
               appalled and enthralled.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh my God... I can feel the 
                         contractions coming on...

               Bernie rushes over to Shelly...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, stop them! Don't do this!

                                     SHELLY
                         Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing 
                         to do with you.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's got everything to do with me. 
                         He's my son.

               Everyone stops dead. Freeze frame. Shelly gets a weird look 
               in his eye. A fuse has just been lit...

                                     SHELLY
                         What did you say?

                                     BERNIE
                         I said, he's my --

                                     SHELLY
                         Who? This little prick?

               Shelly smashes Mikey across the shoulder with the bat.

               AARRRGGGGHHH!!! Shelly raises the bat to cream Mikey again... 
               Bernie grabs Shelly's arm. Shelly shoves him back.

               Raises the bat again...

                                     MIKEY
                         Pop, help me...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, don't you fucking do it!

               Shelly freezes. He lowers the bat, throws it aside. Grabs 
               Bernie by his collar...

                                     SHELLY
                         Were you in on this? Jesus, you better 
                         come clean with me.

                                     BERNIE
                         NO! God, no! I didn't know nothing 
                         about it.

               Shelly releases Bernie. There's a strange look in Shelly's 
               eye. We see the wheels turning...

                                     SHELLY
                         How much you think their lives are 
                         worth, Bernie? Myself, I don't think 
                         they're worth piss. But, hey, it 
                         ain't my kid...

               Bernie sees where Shelly's going with this. We can almost 
               hear the cell door slamming in his head.

                                     SHELLY
                         Let me see: they were up almost a 
                         hundred and fifty grand. That's 150 
                         G's someone's gonna have to account 
                         for. What do you say, Bernie, seventy-
                         five grand a piece?

               Bernie glances over at Natalie. She has tears in her eyes.

               He looks to Shelly pleadingly. Please don't do this...

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, I know you don't have that kind 
                         of cash. But, since you're a friend 
                         of the house, I'm willing to front 
                         you.

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, they didn't get away with 
                         the money... You didn't lose 
                         anything...

               Shelly glances over at Lou, nods. Lou kicks Mikey in the 
               face. His nose snaps like a twig.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh Jesus... Yes! All right. It's on 
                         me. 150 G's.

               Charlene clutches her belly, moans...

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me 
                         to the hospital... contractions...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, please help her. That's my 
                         grandson...

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, why don't we all break out the 
                         champagne? Lootz is about to become 
                         a granddaddy.
                              (walks over to her)
                         How you doin' there, sweetheart? 
                         Must hurt like crap, huh?

                                     CHARLENE
                              (nods)
                         Hurts so bad...

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah?

               Suddenly Shelly kicks Charlene in the belly! WHAM! She 
               screeches out.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh God...

                                     BERNIE
                         Jesus NOOOOO!!!

               Even Shelly's goons can't believe what they've just witnessed. 
               Larry is aghast. Bernie rushes Shelly, starts raining blows 
               on him. Shelly swats him off. He drops down next to the 
               squirming girl, rips her sweater and blouse up over her 
               stomach...

               ...to reveal a mound of fake padding. He tears the padding 
               away from her, throws it at Bernie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got 
                         a cigar?

               The muscle start laughing it up. Relief. Larry emits a nervous 
               giggle. Natalie's jaw hits the floor. Bernie takes a step 
               back. He's about to go into serious shock. Charlene curls 
               over, sobbing.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Bernie)
                         You sure you still want to be good 
                         for it? Because if you want to change 
                         your mind, I don't blame you.

               Bernie looks over at Mikey. He stares up at his father, 
               trembling.

                                     MIKEY
                         I'll make it up to you, Pop, I 
                         swear...

               Bernie holds his son's gaze for a beat. He's almost tempted 
               to... He just shrugs and nods at Shelly.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's on me.

                                     SHELLY
                              (shakes his head)
                         That's the worst fucking call you 
                         ever made in your life.

               ON NATALIE at that moment. We can tell she agrees with 
               Shelly... but thinks all the more of Bernie for it. That 
               might even be love in her eyes.

               Shelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor. Walks 
               over to Mikey, and brings it down full force, pulverizing 
               Mikey's left kneecap. Oh man, the scream...

                                     BERNIE
                         What are you doing?! I thought we 
                         had --

                                     SHELLY
                         150 G's buys their lives. This is 
                         just a little slap on the wrist to 
                         remember me by.

               Natalie turns her head. She's about to throw up. Larry 
               watches, unflinchingly. Charlene is making with some serious 
               pleading now.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh god... it wasn't my idea.

               Shelly steps up to Charlene, tapping the base of the bat in 
               the palm of his hand. He smiles reassuringly at her.

                                     SHELLY
                         You know, motherhood is a beautiful 
                         thing. This... you made a mockery 
                         out of it. Maybe you'll get to 
                         experience it for real one day.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (nods, sobbing)
                         I want... to be a mother... please 
                         don't hurt me...

                                     SHELLY
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

               Shelly turns his back on her. Charlene starts sobbing relief. 
               They're not going to hurt her. It's going to be all right. 
               Wrong. Shelly throws the bat to Lou. The heavy steps up to 
               the plate (as we RACK FOCUS to Shelly walking away) -- 
               CRUNCH!!! followed by the girl's SHRIEKS. Natalie buries her 
               head in Bernie's shoulder.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Tony and Lou)
                         Get 'em outta here. You ever see 
                         them in this joint again, kill 'em.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Bernie and Natalie)
                         You two, you're still on shift.

               Shelly catches Larry's eye: I hope you were taking notes.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie's seated on the edge of his bed, drowning his sorrows 
               with a bottle of gin. Moonlight paints him in jail bars of 
               shadow. Natalie lingers in the b.g.

                                     BERNIE
                         I did this to myself. I planted the 
                         seed. When Angela took off with Mikey, 
                         I didn't... I never made an effort 
                         to get back in his life. I figured, 
                         the kid don't need a loser for a 
                         father. Now it's all come full circle. 
                         I give him the money, I open the 
                         door to all this... I musta had it 
                         coming. Payback.

               Natalie's hand lowers the needle onto the Sinatra record.

               "Nice 'n' Easy" starts up.

               She walks over to Bernie, takes the bottle away. Helps him 
               to his feet.

               He gives himself over to her reassuring embrace. Natalie 
               raises Bernie's face to her's.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, it's a big world out there. 
                         If you just took off -- if we took 
                         off.

               Bernie shakes his head. It's too late for that now.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

               Natalie staring up at the ceiling, Bernie nuzzled against 
               her. Her features appear softer than ever. Luminous in the 
               moonlight. Realization moist in her eyes.

                                     NATALIE
                         You awake, Bernie?

               He grunts something inaudible.

                                     NATALIE
                         I -- think I love you.

               Bernie tenses up. Huh?

                                     NATALIE
                         No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain 
                         of it.

               Bernie raises his head, not quite sure he heard her right.

               Natalie sits up, hugs her knees. Bernie finds himself staring 
               at her back.

                                     NATALIE
                         You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I 
                         never saw this coming. You shouldn't 
                         do that to a girl.

               Bernie reaches out, caresses her back. She emits a shiver...

                                     NATALIE
                         There's still things you don't know... 
                         should know... I don't want to ruin 
                         it...

               Bernie pulls Natalie back toward him.

                                     BERNIE
                         It won't make any difference, Natalie. 
                         Whatever you come clean about, I'm 
                         not gonna feel any different about 
                         you. I'd say the words, but with my 
                         luck...

                                     NATALIE
                         Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten 
                         luck. That's overs.

                                     BERNIE
                              (a beat)
                         I love you, Natalie.

               Natalie smothers her lips against Bernie's. He enshrouds her 
               in his arms. Fade out...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Fade into SOFT FOCUS. Slowing taking form... A CAT'S FACE 
               seen in extreme close-up.

               WIDER -- to reveal the cat resting on Bernie's chest. She 
               MEOWS as he stirs awake. He's stunned to see her there.

                                     BERNIE
                         Trixie?

               The cat jumps off his chest and slinks over to her empty 
               food bowl. Meows again. Bernie breaks into a wide smile.

                                     BERNIE
                         Trix. You came back.

               Bernie shields his eyes from the bright sunlight streaming 
               in through the blinds. Huh? This is a first for him. He's 
               never gotten direct sunlight in his room before. What's the 
               deal? Did the world just turn on its axis?

               He glances over his shoulder... No Natalie. Just her 
               impression in the sheets. And a note on her pillow. For a 
               moment his heart stops. He conjures up the worst. Grabs up 
               the note, unfolds it.

               We see a lipstick kiss and the words: HAVE A SPECTACULAR 
               DAY!

               Bernie lets out a joyful whoop! Leaps out of bed...

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

               CLOSE-UP: Trixie eating some tuna out of her bowl. We hear 
               the record player needle drop on "Luck Be A Lady." Cut to:

               Bernie's feet gliding around the room... PAN UP to Bernie 
               dancing with himself. He's positively aglow. He snatches up 
               a salt shaker and sings along with Sinatra. It's true -- 
               love makes the world go around. It obviously also gives life 
               to dead plants, as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung 
               up overnight above his radiator. But we won't dwell on that.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - DAY

               Bernie struts into the casino a changed man (still to the 
               tune of "Luck Be a Lady"). Even his limp seems less pronounced 
               as he greets fellow workers as they pass.

               He catches a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror. Maybe for 
               the first time, he likes what he sees. In the reflection he 
               notices Natalie smiling at him. He meets her eyes. She averts 
               them quickly, keeps walking.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

               Shelly watches Bernie from the video monitor. He appears 
               less than delighted over Bernie's sunny disposition. He picks 
               up the phone, dials.

                                     SHELLY
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, it's me. Get Bernie over to 
                         crap table six.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Per usual, Bernie walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of 
               coffee. Doris slides it over.

                                     BERNIE
                              (looking around)
                         Got any cre --

               Before he can answer, Doris hands him a container of cream.

               A full container. Taken aback, he starts pouring it into his 
               cup, when he hears a VOICE over the intercom:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Lovett, party of six, your table is 
                         ready, Lovett, party of six.

               Bernie looks to Doris.

                                     BERNIE
                         Duty calls.

               INT. CASINO - MONTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

               A -- Bernie arrives at a hundred dollar blackjack table just 
               in time for the dealer to bust out. The crowd goes crazy!

               B -- Bernie takes a break by leaning up against the side of 
               a slot machine. Suddenly, the woman playing it hits a jackpot.

               C -- Everywhere he seems to go, people continue to win.

               D -- Bernie, despite the spooky irony, can't help but smile 
               as mountains of chips pile up on the tables. Shelly appears 
               behind him. Not a happy camper. He gestures Bernie to follow 
               him.

               INT. CASINO SLOTS AREA - NIGHT

               They head over to a section of slots. As they pass one of 
               those huge million dollar slots, the FLOOR MANAGER cuts in 
               front of them.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new 
                         Mega-Million. I call her Marnie, 
                         'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure, 
                         once in a while she'll flash you a 
                         bit of tit, but your chances of 
                         hitting a home run -- one in twenty 
                         million. Here, give her a shot...

               He hands Shelly a cup of quarters, takes off. Shelly looks 
               to Bernie. He's trying to keep a lid on his anger.

                                     SHELLY
                              (feeding Marnie 
                              quarters)
                         You wanna tell me what's going on 
                         out there?

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't know...

               Shelly pulls the lever.

                                     SHELLY
                         What do you mean...

               Marnie immediately spits out a small jackpot.

                                     SHELLY
                              (reacts with surprise)
                         What do you mean, you don't know? 
                         We're down almost a mil out there. 
                         Doesn't seem strange to you?

                                     BERNIE
                              (shrugs)
                         Guess I'm having an off day.

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't have off days, Lootz. You're 
                         shitty luck incarnate. What's wrong? 
                         You coming down with something? You've 
                         got this look about you...

               Shelly starts feeding Marnie again.

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing's wrong. Fact is, I've never 
                         felt better.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     BERNIE
                         She loves me, Shelly. She told me 
                         last night. Natalie.

               On the mention of Natalie's name, we hear a shrieking SIREN, 
               followed by a deafening toll of slot bells. Shelly's just 
               landed the million dollar jackpot. Shelly stares at the slot 
               in surprise -- then looks over at Bernie. Realization hits 
               hard. Fuck! The floor manager staggers over. His expression 
               is priceless.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Sweet Jesus... you popped her 
                         cherries.

               SEVERAL CASINO WORKERS have gathered to witness the 
               deflowering of Marnie. They gaze reverently upon her, as if 
               witnessing the "Close Encounters" mothership for the first 
               time. Shelly drags Bernie out of earshot.

                                     SHELLY
                         Natalie? She told you, she loves 
                         you?

               Bernie nods, a huge grin wrenching his cheeks apart. He's 
               about to go helium on us.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Natalie's serving drinks to a table of high rollers, when 
               Tony and Lou appear behind her...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The door to Shelly's office slams behind Natalie. Shelly 
               glares at her from behind his desk. We see him thumbing his 
               steel abacus. The beads drifting toward the center. Natalie 
               shakily lights up a cigarette.

                                     SHELLY
                         Put that fucking thing out!

               Natalie, startled, drops her cigarettes. She kneels to gather 
               them up.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sorry.

                                     SHELLY
                         You should be. You've gone and fucked 
                         it up big time. I paid you to be his 
                         cooze companion, not his fucking 
                         true love. But, no, you had to go 
                         and get all profound on the poor 
                         schmuck.
                              (mimics female voice)
                         "I love you, Bernie." You know what 
                         you've gone and done, sweetheart? 
                         Those four little words of endearment 
                         have already cost this casino a 
                         million and counting today.

                                     NATALIE
                         I don't understand...

                                     SHELLY
                              (jumps to his feet)
                         Lady luck. You never heard'a lady 
                         luck?! That's what's goin' on out 
                         there. Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick. 
                         He should have 'em throwing ice cubes 
                         out there, but instead I got a fuckin' 
                         meltdown on my hands.

               Shelly walks around his desk to Natalie.

                                     SHELLY
                         OK, here's what's gonna happen. You're 
                         outta his life by the time he gets 
                         home. Don't even tell him to his 
                         face, just leave a note. I'll make 
                         some calls, situate you at another 
                         joint.

                                     NATALIE
                         I can't do that.

                                     SHELLY
                              (right in her face)
                         Excuse me?

                                     NATALIE
                         It wasn't an act. I meant it. I love 
                         him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (close to losing it)
                         What's there to fuckin' love? He's a 
                         loser. Always has been, always will 
                         be.

                                     NATALIE
                         I thought you were his friend...

                                     SHELLY
                         And I thought you were a smart cookie 
                         when I picked you out. You do not 
                         want to fuck me over, darlin'. I'll 
                         see to it that your next John's a 
                         rattlesnake out in the desert. Now 
                         get the fuck outta here.

               Natalie rushes from the office in tears. Shelly closes his 
               eyes for a moment -- gotta keep it together.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - NIGHT

               Bernie approaches some cocktail waitresses about to go off 
               duty.

                                     BERNIE
                         Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around? 
                         I'm supposed to give her a ride home.

                                     COCKTAIL WAITRESS #1
                         I think she left already. She wasn't 
                         feelin' too good. We been covering 
                         for her.

               Off Bernie's expression: Oh...

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie's Buick pulls into the lot. He parks, heads for his 
               room.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie enters. Flips on the light. No Natalie.

                                     BERNIE
                              (calls to the bathroom)
                         Natalie? You in there?

               No answer. He heads over. Finds it empty. Concern spreads 
               across his features. He glances around the room. Notices the 
               closet wide open. Natalie's clothes missing.

                                     BERNIE
                              (sotto)
                         Natalie.

               That's when he catches sight of the note taped to the dresser 
               mirror. He rushes over, rips it off.

               I'M SORRY BERNIE. I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T IN THE CARDS FOR 
               US. TAKE CARE, NATALIE.

               Bernie slumps to the floor in disbelief. Starts to tremble.

               Then rocks back and forth, wracked by stifled sobs. Christ, 
               make it stop hurting...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Bernie seated at the foot of the bed, drinking bourbon from 
               a solitary glass. He's almost gone through an entire bottle.

               He glances down, notices a pair of Natalie's stockings 
               sticking out from under the bed. He brings them up to his 
               face. Breathes her in, only to exhale a sorry breath.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - BAR - NIGHT

               Bernie stops at the bar for a cup of coffee. Doris starts to 
               pour the cream... whoops... empty. Bernie shrugs. Par for 
               the course. Time to go to work.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               We see Bernie back in top form. Forget Mr. Cool, he's turned 
               into Mr. Freeze with a vengeance. The high rollers are facing 
               a nuclear winter on the floor thanks to Bernie.

               SERIES

               A -- A man with a fresh bankroll sits at a card table full 
               of hubris. Bernie pulls up a chair next to him.

               B -- We see a crowd of players hovering over a busy craps 
               table. The cheerful congregation turns sour as the dice are 
               flung. Players groan as they jettison the table, leaving 
               just Bernie...

               C -- We see a dealer pull a six card twenty one as players 
               sit with twelves and thirteens. They sit stunned as their 
               money is swept away. The same man with the hefty bankroll 
               unclips the last of his green. He throws it over to the dealer 
               to change in.

               D -- Larry, roaming the floor, is visibly disturbed by 
               Bernie's cooling ability. It's something he can't quantify 
               and it unsettles him. He glances up toward Shelly's 
               observation window, knows the man is gloating.

               Good call. From behind the glass, Shelly lights up a stogey. 
               Hint of a smile. You go, Bernie.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               Johnny Cappella rocks the house. PAN ACROSS to Shelly and 
               Bernie seated in Shelly's booth. Shelly is in a jovial mood, 
               while Bernie is a portrait of misery.

                                     BERNIE
                         I want you to tell me the truth, 
                         Shelly. Did you say something to 
                         Natalie? Did you muscle her --

                                     SHELLY
                         Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think 
                         of me? That I would fuck with your 
                         happiness? That hurts.

               Bernie shrugs an apology, shifts his gaze to Johnny Cappella.

                                     BERNIE
                         This guy's all flash. No soul. I 
                         miss Buddy. Place isn't the same 
                         without him.

                                     SHELLY
                         Buddy was tired. I gave him an easy 
                         out. It coulda been a lot worse...

                                     BERNIE
                              (confused)
                         You gave him an easy out? What are 
                         you talkin' about? I thought he...

               Shelly looks almost... tortured. Something he needs to get 
               off his chest.

                                     SHELLY
                         He woulda never taken the buy-out 
                         offer. Buddy woulda stuck to his 
                         guns, no matter what. And they woulda 
                         ended up hurting him. I couldn't let 
                         that happen.

                                     BERNIE
                         Jesus... you... How can you sit here 
                         and justify it? Like you were Dr. 
                         Kevorkian or something?

                                     SHELLY
                         Listen to me, you dumb fuck -- I 
                         loved that sonofabitch. But his time 
                         was up. What I was supposed to do, 
                         leave him to those corporate wolves? 
                         What I did, it was the humanitarian 
                         thing. That I have no doubt about. 
                         Afterwards, I held him in my arms 
                         and I cried like a fucking baby. 
                         What? You got this look -- what's 
                         this fucking look?

               Off Bernie's shocked expression --

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie sits watching TV, a bottle of Ten High next to him on 
               the bed. Same religious channel. This time it's a mass baptism 
               taking place on some river bank. He's about to doze off, 
               when he hears a light rapping on the door. He cocks his head, 
               not sure if it's the booze talking.

               Bernie throws open the door --

               Natalie standing there. A lonely angel framed in the doorway. 
               Suitcase at her feet. 24 carat tears glistening in the dark.

               They just stare at each other for an extended beat. Then 
               Natalie stumbles into Bernie's arms. Clingwraps herself to 
               him. Bernie squeezes his eyes closed. Holds on for dear life. 
               It's a different kind of pain now; one that hurts so good.

               ANGLE ON NATALIE

               from over Bernie's shoulder. There's a bittersweet look about 
               her. Nothing good can come of this. But that's tomorrow. A 
               long ways off.

               INT. BERNIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

               Bernie and Natalie lie in each other's arms. Bernie seems at 
               ease. Natalie eyeballs the ceiling, smoke wisping up from a 
               cigarette.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie? You awake?

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah.

                                     NATALIE
                         Let's just take off.

               Bernie looks over at her.

                                     NATALIE
                         I mean it. Let's just pack up and 
                         go. Tonight.

                                     BERNIE
                              (closes his eyes)
                         I can't do that. I've got an 
                         obligation to Shelly. There's no --

                                     NATALIE
                         Fuck Shelly. He doesn't give a shit 
                         about you. Let's just climb into 
                         your car and get the hell out of 
                         here.

               Bernie cuts her off.

                                     BERNIE
                         I can't do that, Natalie. They'd 
                         come after me. And because you were 
                         with me... I wouldn't want that on 
                         me.

               Natalie finishes her cigarette. Well, she's made her bed.

               Bernie starts nuzzling her. She turns away.

                                     NATALIE
                         Just hold me.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - DAY

               Shelly looking on as a high roller cleans up at craps. With 
               Bernie standing right there next to the guy.

               Which only seems to make it worse, as Bernie's presence spurs 
               the player on to an even bigger win.

               Bernie has that goofy "my heart is full" look about him.

               Which can mean only one thing in Shelly's book. The man looks 
               about ready to split an atom. We see Larry hovering nearby 
               with a smug grin. Off of Shelly's enraged expression...

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY

               Lou's black Oldsmobile pulls into the parking lot. Shelly 
               and the boys climb out, head for...

               EXT. THE MOTEL COURTYARD - DAY

               Natalie's sunning herself at the pool. The only other people 
               around are a middle-aged couple and a young boy.

               Shelly (slipping on his leather gloves), followed by Lou and 
               Tony, strides purposefully up to Natalie -- no hellos, nothing -- 
               just grabs her by the hair...

                                     NATALIE
                         Hey! Ouch! What are you...?

               He drags Natalie over to Bernie's room, kicks the door open, 
               shoves Natalie inside...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Shelly throws Natalie onto the bed. Lou closes the door and 
               draws the blinds.

                                     NATALIE
                         You got no fucking right...!

                                     SHELLY
                         What did I tell you?! What did I 
                         fuckin' tell you?!

                                     NATALIE
                         I tried... I couldn't...

                                     SHELLY
                         I don't give a fuck!

               Shelly heads over to the closet, rips it open, pulls out a 
               suitcase. He starts throwing Natalie's clothes into the case.

                                     SHELLY
                         You're gone, sweetheart. History. 
                         Kiss paradise goodbye.

                                     NATALIE
                              (hysterical)
                         I can't leave! I won't! I love him. 
                         Doesn't that mean anything to you, 
                         you heartless fuck?

               Shelly stops packing. He grabs Natalie up off the bed, starts 
               smacking her around.

                                     SHELLY
                         Who the fuck do you think you are? 
                         You ain't nobody! I could make you 
                         disappear like this...
                              (snaps his fingers)
                         And nobody would ever notice you 
                         were gone. Nobody!

                                     NATALIE
                              (yells)
                         Bernie would! I got friends! You 
                         don't fuckin' own me. You got no 
                         right --

               Shelly lifts Natalie up, throws her across the room into the 
               dresser mirror. SMASH! She crumbles to the floor, glass 
               showering her. Natalie grabs up a shard, rushes Shelly with 
               it...

                                     NATALIE
                         Fuck you!

               She slashes Shelly across the arm. Ouch, fuck! Before Tony 
               and Lou can make a move, Shelly ensnares her wrist -- snaps 
               it backwards -- AARRRRGGHHH!!! Shelly snatches up the shard, 
               shoves her back on the bed. We see her terror reflected in 
               the jagged glass against her cheek...

                                     SHELLY
                         You fuckin' cunt...

               He slices her cheek open.

               Tony and Lou look on with mutual expressions: Shelly's getting 
               a little carried away here.

               Shelly staggers to his feet...

                                     SHELLY
                         You think that's bad? That's just a 
                         taste, bitch. You're still here when 
                         Bernie gets home and I'll finish the 
                         job. I'll cut you into so many fuckin' 
                         pieces, the vultures'll be trading 
                         on you for a month.

               Shelly reaches into his jacket, pulls out a wad of bills.

               Throws them at Natalie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Here... go get yourself some cosmetic 
                         surgery.

               Shelly gestures to Tony and Lou. They exit the room, leaving 
               Natalie sobbing into one of Bernie's pillows.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie parks. Heads for his room. He's about to reach for 
               his key, when he realizes the door is slightly ajar. He pushes 
               his way into...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               ...darkness.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie.

               Bernie fumbles for the light switch...

                                     NATALIE (O.S.)
                         No, don't. I've got a headache.

                                     BERNIE
                              (closing the door)
                         Did you take something? I got some 
                         aspirin in the --

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah. I already took something.

               There's just enough moonlight in the room for Bernie to make 
               out Natalie curled over on the bed. As he approaches, he 
               trips over Natalie's suitcase on the floor.

                                     BERNIE
                         Ouch!

               He cuts himself on a splinter of shattered glass as he 
               staggers to his feet. Which draws his attention to the mirror. 
               Moonlight glows off the edges. That's all there is -- edges. 
               On the dresser: his bottle of Ten High. Empty.

               Confused, Bernie fumbles his way over to Natalie on the bed.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie, what happened? The mirror...

               He reaches out to touch her face... instead his hand makes 
               contact with a lump.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie.

               He jerks back, flips on the nightstand lamp.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, no! Shit...

               Bernie chokes at the sight of her. She clutches a bloody rag 
               to her cheek. Blood on the pillow... blood on the sheets...

               And tears.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh Jesus... Natalie, who did this to 
                         you? We need to call the police...

                                     NATALIE
                         I love you, Bernie. I just want you 
                         to know that. I fell in love with 
                         you. That wasn't part of the plan. I 
                         thought... easy money...

                                     BERNIE
                         What are you saying?

                                     NATALIE
                         Shelly. He paid me to get next to 
                         you. To keep you around. Whatever it 
                         took...

                                     BERNIE
                              (a whisper)
                         Shelly?

                                     NATALIE
                         You got it right the first night. I 
                         was for sale. Bought and paid for. 
                         You were the easy mark, Bernie.

               Bernie slumps down on the edge of the bed. Sucker-punched.

               Trying to make sense of it.

                                     NATALIE
                         At first you were just another John. 
                         But then I started to take a closer 
                         look. For the first time, here was 
                         someone who wasn't trying to hustle 
                         me. Wasn't pretending to be somebody 
                         he wasn't. Just a decent guy trying 
                         to get back on track. And it didn't 
                         hurt any that you put me up on a 
                         pedestal. It sure puts the gutter 
                         into perspective...

                                     BERNIE
                              (still in disbelief)
                         Shelly...

                                     NATALIE
                         Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring 
                         you luck. Lady luck. I stayed... to 
                         tell you to your face... and then 
                         you wouldn't want me no more... and 
                         I could just go...

               Bernie stands shakily.

                                     BERNIE
                         We gotta get you to the hospital. 
                         We'll talk about this later.

                                     NATALIE
                         Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell 
                         me there's gonna be a later.

               Bernie doesn't answer her.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM WAITING AREA - NIGHT

               FADE IN on Bernie's hunched over figure, waiting on Natalie.

               He tugs at his car keys as he wrestles with his emotions.

               Natalie's betrayal has finally sunken in. The man's in pain.

               His natural instinct is to just take off. Run. Fuck Natalie. 
               Fuck Shelly. Fuck this whole goddamn town.

               Suddenly he looks up. A couple of people pass by in front of 
               him... and then there she is. Standing a few feet away, face 
               patched-up, arms clutching herself, not sure whether to 
               approach him or not.

               The sight of her just breaks Bernie's heart. He stands slowly, 
               legs like jelly -- and in that instant it's all so clear to 
               him. He walks over, forgiveness in his eyes, contrition in 
               hers.

               She tries to say something. He shakes his head.

                                     BERNIE
                         Ssshh.

               They embrace with an intensity that threatens to merge their 
               atoms into a single being.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               Bernie drives down a quiet Vegas street. It's spooky.

               Almost too quiet. All the lights are green as they cruise 
               into the night.

                                     NATALIE
                         Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's 
                         all gonna be okay.

                                     BERNIE
                         Everything's gonna be fine. This is 
                         our time. This is you and me and 
                         we're going for it.

               Natalie leans over and kisses him. As she does so, she catches 
               sight of her face in the mirror. Starts to tear up.

                                     BERNIE
                         You look in the mirror, you don't 
                         like what you see, don't believe it. 
                         You look in my eyes. That's the only 
                         mirror you gonna need. Look in my 
                         eyes, Natalie.

               She looks into Bernie's eyes. Sees the most beautiful girl 
               in the world. Tears roll down her cheeks.

                                     BERNIE
                         I love you. Marry me?

               Off Natalie's startled reaction...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL - NIGHT

               A NEON SIGN READS: "HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL. OPEN 24 
               HOURS."

               BOOM DOWN as Bernie carries Natalie out of the chapel, their 
               lips fused together.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie burn down the highway. The lights of the 
               big city just a glimmer in the rearview.

               Up ahead, a billboard reads: THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO. 
               TAKE A GAMBLE ON PARADISE.

               TIGHT on Bernie. His expression turns grim. Natalie picks up 
               on it. She shakes her head. Silently pleading: Bernie, no.

               Bernie tries to shrug it off. But the spectre of Shelly sits 
               firmly on his shoulder. There's no escaping him. We see Bernie 
               fighting it. Losing. SHIT!

               In the next instant, Bernie pulls a quick U-turn across the 
               middle shoulder, starts back toward Vegas.

               EXT. CASINO PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Bernie pulls into the parking lot. Kills his lights.

               INT. BERNIE'S BUICK - NIGHT

               Bernie reaches for the door. Natalie grabs his arm.

                                     NATALIE
                         You don't have to do this, Bernie.

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right 
                         to his face. I will not look over my 
                         shoulder for the rest of my life -- 
                         our lives.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, your chart... that first 
                         night. I wasn't being straight with 
                         you. It's the worst chart I've ever 
                         seen. There's nothing in the cards 
                         for you. I'm scared...

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't you see, that was before you 
                         opened your heart to me. Everything's 
                         different now. I got lady luck on my 
                         side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to 
                         me.

               Natalie shakily opens her purse, pulls out a handful of 
               hundreds. Pushes the money at Bernie...

                                     NATALIE
                         It's three thousand dollars. Take 
                         it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a 
                         down payment. We can send him the 
                         rest in installments... after we get 
                         settled.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think --

                                     NATALIE
                         Take it.

               Bernie stuffs the cash in his jacket. Climbs out.

                                     BERNIE
                         Whatever happens, I --

                                     NATALIE
                              (abrupt)
                         I know, Bernie.

               She turns away. Stares out the window, tears streaming down 
               her cheeks.

                                     NATALIE
                              (sotto; gentle)
                         I know.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie makes for the Paradise Lounge. SPLIT SECOND FLASHBACK 
               as he imagines Shelly laying into Natalie. Fast cuts.

               Reverberating sound echoes. Just the fuel Bernie needs to 
               make his stand. By the time he arrives at

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               He's practically foaming at the mouth with rage. He barges 
               in to find Shelly at a table in agitated conversation with 
               Nicky, Larry and Marty. They fall silent, realizing something 
               is wrong.

                                     SHELLY
                         Bernie, what's the matter? You look 
                         a little fucking spooked.

               Bernie throws something in Shelly's face. It's that bloody 
               rag Natalie was holding to her cheek. It lands on the table 
               in front of everyone.

               Shelly swats it away with disgust. Jumps to his feet. WHAM!

               Bernie slugs him one. As Shelly doubles over, Bernie gets in 
               his face.

                                     BERNIE
                         You lay another finger on her, I 
                         swear to God I'll kill you. You hear 
                         me? I'll fuckin' kill you!

               Shelly's goons quickly move in, grab Bernie. Drag him away.

               Shelly composes himself, turns to his guests.

                                     SHELLY
                         Will you excuse me for a moment?

               He rushes off. Nicky shoots Larry a resigned look.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Lou shoves Bernie inside. Bernie kisses floor. Shelly strides 
               past, leans against his desk. Bernie slowly drags himself to 
               his feet.

                                     BERNIE
                              (a hoarse whisper)
                         Why? Why, Shelly?

                                     SHELLY
                         Because you never give up a good 
                         thing, Bernie. You are a good thing. 
                         The best fuckin' cooler there ever 
                         was. And I need him back.

                                     BERNIE
                         He ain't never comin' back.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's a dead man talking.

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm through with this joint, Shelly. 
                         Natalie and me, we just got married. 
                         We're outta here. I'll get a job out 
                         there in the world. Send you half my 
                         paycheck every month. Make good on 
                         my obligations.

                                     SHELLY
                              (gets in Bernie's 
                              face)
                         You try to walk on me, Bernie, and 
                         I'll fuckin' bury you. The both of 
                         you.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think so.

               Shelly's expression: Oh yeah?

                                     BERNIE
                         You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't 
                         the world's biggest loser no more. 
                         That honor's gonna fall upon you, 
                         Shelly. And maybe you had it all 
                         along.

                                     SHELLY
                         What the fuck? Me? I'm the loser?

                                     BERNIE
                         What you got? What do you got in 
                         your life besides this joint?

                                     SHELLY
                         What the fuck more do I need?

                                     BERNIE
                         You got nothin', Shelly. This place -- 
                         your legacy -- it's a mirage. You 
                         turn your back and it don't even 
                         exist. There's no day, there's no 
                         night, it's all just one big fuckin' 
                         blur and it don't count for nothin'!

               Shelly looks to Tony and Lou:

                                     SHELLY
                         You believe this fuckin' guy?

               Bernie gets eye-to-eye with Shelly. A first.

                                     BERNIE
                         I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you 
                         got this fear of germs thing. But it 
                         goes deeper than that. You can't get 
                         close to no one. On an emotional 
                         level. You're the worst kind of 
                         gambler there ever was: too scared 
                         to put his chips on the table. Too 
                         scared to open his heart... to extend 
                         any real kinda friendship. Always 
                         afraid it's gonna end out in the 
                         desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams, 
                         pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's 
                         where it ends, that's where it ends.

               Bernie turns his back on Shelly, strides over to the door.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz. 
                         All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face 
                         intensity. You almost sold me.
                              (massages his throat)
                         Man, I've got a fucking lump in my 
                         throat.
                              (a beat)
                         But it still don't change things. 
                         You bail on me without making good 
                         on my 150 G's and I'm gonna be forced 
                         to close the books on you. You and 
                         the broad. You leave me no choice.

               Bernie turns, looks at Shelly. Shelly's dead serious. They 
               hard stare each other for a beat. Bernie doesn't say anything. 
               At least, not out loud. His eyes do all the talking: "I guess 
               you leave me no choice either." HOLD on Bernie's steely 
               resolve.

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               This could be the opening of the film -- Bernie standing 
               with his back to us, facing the gold elevator doors. Murky 
               reflection. The floor lights ascending fast...

               The doors open and the soundtrack goes SILENT. SLOW PUSH IN 
               on him as he takes in the action -- a gladiator about to 
               enter the Coliseum. Something comes alive in his eyes. A 
               spark of determination. This is not the expression of a loser. 
               CLOSE-UP as his foot steps onto the casino floor --

               An explosion of amplified CASINO WALLA shatters the previous 
               silence.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               We follow Bernie as he wanders through the casino like he's 
               done a thousand times -- but this time with conviction.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Bernie steps up to an empty table, throws down the whole 
               three grand onto the felt.

                                     BERNIE
                         Change only...

               The CREW working the table stop down as they realize who it 
               is. The table is dead. Bernie couldn't be needed. The croupier 
               slowly gathers up the green, hands it to the boxman.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Check change three thousand.

               The boxman counts the cash.

                                     BOXMAN
                         This a pleasure cruise, Bernie?

                                     BERNIE
                         You could say that.

                                     BOXMAN
                         Well, it'll be a short one. Table's 
                         dead.

                                     CROUPIER
                         It is now, anyway.

               The others chuckle. The boxman counts out the chips; they're 
               given to Bernie. He places them all on the passline.

               The stickman pushes over the dice. Bernie picks a couple.

               He throws....

                                     STICKMAN
                         Yo Eleven! Pay the line.

               Bernie picks up his three thousand dollars in winnings. He 
               lets it ride. The table quickly fills up with hungry players.

               Bernie throws the dice again...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Winner seven!

               Bernie is now paid six thousand dollars on his pass line 
               bet.

               The other players also collect their winnings. They can feel 
               something in the air.

               Bernie, forehead beaded with sweat, rubs the felt a little 
               before he picks up the dice. He throws...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six easy. Easy way six!

               Bernie takes double odds on his bet. The boxman isn't sure 
               what to do. Does he stop him? Does he dare?

               In the b.g., people gather to watch the action. Whatever it 
               is, it's catching. The table next to them bursts into 
               applause.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR  MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A -- Close on a slot machine as it pays out. The woman grabs 
               the payout feverishly.

               B -- A group at the blackjack table cheers as the dealer 
               busts out.

               C -- The line at the cashier cage gets longer and longer. 

               -- CHIPS. Stacks and stacks of chips, being meticulously 
               counted.

               D -- A quick shot of a roulette ball dropping into number 
               twenty-one. The dealer slowly puts the marker atop a large 
               stack of chips in the twenty-one square.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               A shot of the faces of frenzied dice players waiting for the 
               outcome of the throw. Followed by a thunderous release as 
               the point is made.

               In the center of it all. Bernie Lootz. His rail is nearly 
               full of chips. The other players pat him on the back and 
               shake his hand as the croupiers busily pay the line.

               He's a winner. And it's infectious. He's gone and 
               "contaminated" the entire casino. The slots are ringing out 
               of control. CHEERING. WHOOPING. MOANS of delight. This much 
               excitement threatens to take the fucking roof off.

               Bernie just gazes around in amazement. If only Natalie could 
               see him now...

                                     BERNIE
                              (sotto)
                         Natalie... this is you...

               Bernie takes a thousand dollars in chips, tosses it gently 
               to the croupier.

                                     BERNIE
                         For the boys.

               The entire crew stop for a moment out of respect. Bernie 
               notices. They all nod as the boxman locks up the tip money.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO 
                         bets, C&E, any seven...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

               Shelly sits alone in his office, nursing a glass of Scotch, 
               listening to some scratchy Chet Baker on the turntable. He 
               looks pre-occupied. Almost melancholic. Bernie's assessment 
               of his life having hit home.

               Suddenly the door is thrown open. It's Tony...

                                     TONY
                         Shelly, take a look at number 4.

               INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - MOMENTS LATER

               Shelly wanders up slowly to find Bernie at the center of the 
               crowd. He steps behind the table into the casino pit to get 
               a closer look.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to the boxman)
                         How much is he up?

               The boxman looks up nervously.

                                     BOXMAN
                         Around three hundred thousand.

               Shelly mouths the words under his breath.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses 
                         call me?

                                     BOXMAN
                         We tried. You weren't picking up. 
                         Besides, it was Bernie.

               The game resumes.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Alright. We're coming out folks, 
                         hands high...

               Bernie stops.

                                     BERNIE
                         Wait!

               Everybody quiets down to listen.

                                     BERNIE
                         Color me up a hundred fifty thousand.
                              (beat)
                         And give it to him.

               Bernie points to Shelly standing in the pit. The crowd watches 
               the drama play out.

                                     BERNIE
                         That's what I owe you, Shelly. There 
                         it is. We're square.
                              (to the table)
                         Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives 
                         up to his obligations.

               The boxman colors up a hundred fifty thousand in chips, lays 
               them out on the table. He counts it and claps his hands 
               together for the cameras.

                                     BOXMAN
                         One hundred fifty thousand, coming 
                         in.

               Shelly stands motionless. Staring into Bernie's eyes. The 
               whole crowd watches. After what seems like an eternity, Shelly 
               nods. Then the Boxman feeds the chips in with the others. A 
               moment later, we can nary tell they were ever gone.

               Larry appears next to Shelly. Nicky and Marty watching from 
               the sidelines -- dour expressions.

                                     LARRY
                         What's the matter with you? He's one 
                         of ours and he's taking us to the 
                         fucking cleaners.

                                     SHELLY
                         Lootz's off the clock. As long as 
                         he's off the clock, he's free to 
                         play. Just like every other schmuck 
                         in this joint.

                                     LARRY
                         It smells wrong. I'm shutting him 
                         down. He's not leaving here with a 
                         dime --

               Shelly suddenly jabs Larry in the throat with the tips of 
               his fingers. Larry gasps, starts to cave. Shelly keeps him 
               upright, escorts him to a nearby men's room. Nicky and Marty 
               looking on in amazement.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The door flies open, Larry catapults into frame. OOF!

               Bounces off the wall. Shelly's right behind him. He drags 
               Larry to his feet. Slams him into the wall again -- gets 
               right up in his face.

                                     SHELLY
                         Now you listen real good, you Harvard 
                         turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He 
                         leaves here tonight with whatever he 
                         comes out with. You so much as touch 
                         a hair on his head and I'll fucking 
                         wallpaper this joint with your ass. 
                         Muted tones, right?
                              (slams him hard)
                         What's that? I don't hear nothing. 
                         Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear 
                         it.

               Blended in at a subsonic level.

               Some kinda mantra: pain, pain, pain.

               Shelly headbutts Larry. It's like the sound of a walnut 
               cracking. Larry slumps to the floor. Shelly takes a deep 
               breath. Control, control, control. He heads over to the sink, 
               washes his hands -- over and over. Larry moaning in the b.g. 
               Shelly adjusts his tie in the mirror. Control.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Shelly exits the men's room, makes his way back to the craps 
               table where Bernie is. Just in time to see Bernie lay twenty 
               five grand on the pass line. A waitress hands a drink off to 
               Bernie. He takes a healthy swig. Then picks up the dice.

               Throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Crap ace deuce! Line down!

               The crowd gasps in horror as Bernie's twenty five grand is 
               quickly raked in. He replaces it with another stack of chips.

               The dice are pushed over to him. He rubs the felt real gently 
               before throwing. Then lets loose the dice.

               All eyes follow the dice. They hit the felt and bounce around 
               behind a stack of chips. The stickman can't spot them.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Call it.

               A croupier makes the call as anxious players rubberneck to 
               get a look.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Twelve crap.

               The crowd groans again. It appears the streak is over.

               Bernie looks out over the felt. This is his moment of truth.

               He unloads his entire rail and puts it on the field.

               He yells out.

                                     BERNIE
                         Fifty thousand dollars!

               The crowd chimes in with every opinion under the sun.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         On the field? What're you fucking 
                         nuts?

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Don't do it!

                                     MAN 2 (O.S.)
                         Shake it, don't break it, baby!

               The dice are slowly pushed over to Bernie. The crowd is 
               feeling it. The entire casino is feeling it. Bernie lets out 
               a long soulful sigh. His whole life depends on the next throw 
               and everyone knows it.

               Bernie rubs the felt as usual and lines up the dice to show 
               a six and a six. He picks them up.

                                     BERNIE
                         Come on sixty-six!

               Locks eyes with Shelly -- then lets loose. The dice fly from 
               his hand. Slowly, ever so slowly we watch them sail across 
               the table. The entire table holds their breath in 
               anticipation...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

               Bernie throws open the doors, stumbles out. His limp seems 
               more pronounced. He wears a miserable expression.

               At the car Bernie steps up. Opens the door, slides in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Natalie throws her arms around him...

                                     NATALIE
                         Thank God... I thought for sure...

               Bernie just looks at her. Pale, mournful features.

                                     NATALIE
                         It's okay, right? You guys worked it 
                         out. He took the three grand? Tell 
                         me it's okay, Bernie?

               He doesn't answer. Just starts up the car...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               On the surveillance monitors: the epidemic continues -- 
               players winning at every table. The Shangri-la's been wiped 
               out. There's no way they can cover this amount of winning 
               action.

               PANNING ACROSS to Shelly. Defeated. The phone rings 
               incessantly in the b.g. Shelly ignores it.

               Lou pokes his head into the office:

                                     LOU
                         Want me to get that, Shelly?

               Shelly doesn't respond. He reaches into his desk drawer for 
               that bottle and a glass. Is about to pour himself a shot...

               Fuck it. Pushes the glass aside. Takes it straight from the 
               bottle. The phone keeps ringing...

               On the scale model of the newly proposed Shangri-la. Hold on 
               it.

               WHAM! A chair enters frame, shatters "paradise."

               WIDER: Shelly trashing the model with a vengeance. Kicking 
               the debris around the office.

               Drenched in sweat, Shelly staggers over to his desk. Swats 
               the empty gin bottle to the floor. Picks up his disinfectant 
               spray, gives his desk one last wipedown. Immaculate.

               Stands, walks out...

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               We see the lights of the city receding in Bernie's rearview 
               mirror. Once outside of the city limits Bernie pulls the car 
               over.

                                     NATALIE
                         What are you stopping for?

               Bernie throws open his door...

                                     BERNIE
                         I think I'm gonna...

               Throw up. And he does. It's as if he's choking up the entire 
               city. Everything that's bad about it. Finally, he pulls 
               himself back into the car. Slams the door.

               Natalie touches his cheek, a reassuring look in her eyes.

               Suddenly, he's smiling. He opens his coat and a huge wad of 
               cash tumbles out. He throws it up into the air. Natalie almost 
               chokes with surprise.

                                     BERNIE
                         Bahamas, here we come, baby.

               She throws her arms around him...

               Suddenly an EXPLOSION OF LIGHT! A flashlight. In the hand of 
               a MOTORCYCLE COP. He raps on the window...

                                     COP
                         Step out of the car please.

                                     BERNIE
                              (lowers the window)
                         What's the problem, officer?

               The cop runs the flashlight over the bundles of cash littering 
               the car interior.

                                     COP
                         Just step out of the car, please. 
                         Both of you.

               Bernie and Natalie exchange unsettled looks. The cop lowers 
               his hand to his gun. Bernie nods at Natalie. They climb out. 
               He directs them off to the side. Shines his light in their 
               faces.

                                     BERNIE
                         If my driving... if I was going a 
                         little fast -- I was just over 
                         excited, officer. See, we just
                         had a big win at the Shangri-la --

                                     COP
                         You didn't win nothing.

               The cop pulls out his revolver, trains it on them.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. SHANGRI-LA UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly opens the door to his Cadillac. Climbs behind the 
               wheel. His keys are already waiting in the ignition. Who's 
               gonna steal Shelly Kaplow's car, right?

               Shelly doesn't start her up. He just leans back in his seat, 
               emits a deep sigh. He glances up at the rearview mirror.

               Catches sight of a SILHOUETTE in the back.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie staring into the barrel of the cop's 
               revolver. Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Bernie nods. So 
               there you have it.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was 
                         too good to be true. Who were we 
                         kidding?

                                     COP
                         Get down on your knees. Both of you.

               They look at him in shock. He gestures them to the ground 
               behind Bernie's car. We CUT TO a shot from the highway: just 
               the cop standing at the tail-end of Bernie's car, Natalie 
               and Bernie hidden from view.

               ON BERNIE AND NATALIE

               down on their knees. Bernie places his arm around Natalie, 
               pulls her close to him. Paralyzed with terror, she still 
               manages a bittersweet smile.

               Bernie should be projecting fear, but there's nothing but 
               his overwhelming love for Natalie in his eyes. It's a two 
               way current.

               This is their last moment together; everything that needs to 
               be said is being transmitted through a look. A look that 
               says: no regrets.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. SHELLY'S CADILLAC - NIGHT

               Nicky leans forward out of the shadows. Shelly holds his 
               gaze in the mirror. Nicky just shrugs.

                                     NICKY
                         The kid wants you should know, Shelly, 
                         he's just protecting our investment -- 
                         the old school way. See you around.

               Shelly nods. He knows the score... A flash of steel appears 
               against his head. Muzzle strobe -- THUP! So long, Shelly 
               Kaplow.

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The cop looms over Bernie and Natalie. Cocks his pistol.

               Lowers the gun to the back of Bernie's head.

               They appear oblivious to it. They're already in another place. 
               Sunning themselves in the Bahamas.

               The cop squeezes back the trigger.

               ON BERNIE AND NATALIE

               still looking at each other. Suddenly the piercing shriek of

               SCREECHING TIRES... followed by a reverberating, bone 
               crunching --

               WHAM! -- and a GUNSHOT.

               Bernie and Natalie still staring into each other's eyes, not 
               quite sure what's just transpired. Only that they're still 
               breathing. They look around, startled to see the tail lights 
               of a PICK-UP TRUCK about ten yards away. The cop, their would-
               be assassin, rendered road kill beneath the wheels.

               All this in the blink of an eye.

               Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Suppresses a hysterical, shock-
               induced giggle. Bernie just looks dumbfounded. He staggers 
               to his feet, rushes over to the pick-up truck. The driver's 
               head is protruding through the shattered windshield.

               Death-glazed eyes.

               Bernie feels for the man's pulse just to be sure. Shakes his 
               head. We see a dozen Coors empties on the seat and floor of 
               the truck.

               Natalie checks the cop. Likewise. Bernie comes over. They 
               regard each other breathlessly.

                                     BERNIE
                         He was drunk. It was just freak 
                         luck...
                              (catches himself...)

                                     NATALIE
                         Don't give it a name, Bernie. It 
                         scares me. All I know is, you're 
                         still running hot and that's a good 
                         thing. But we're only winners if we 
                         keep going. No looking back.

                                     BERNIE
                         Lady luck, Natalie. I'm calling it. 
                         Lady luck. And we got it as long as 
                         we're together. They can't touch us 
                         now.

               He kisses her furiously. Then drags her over to his car.

               They climb in. Drive off.

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY/INT. BERNIE'S BUICK - DAWN

               Bernie's Buick racing into the sunrise. Racing toward the 
               dream. Bernie, eyes fixed on the road ahead, with the 
               contented smile of a man who has gambled on love -- and won.

               His prize, resting her head against his shoulder.

               The money, well, that ain't half bad as well. A smoky, trumpet 
               driven Chet Baker-like piece accentuates the triumphant mood 
               on the soundtrack, as we SUPERIMPOSE...

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               EXT. AIRFIELD -- DAY

               We are moving through a small airfield full of parked light 
               planes. There are no people around. We move through the 
               cluster of planes toward a hangar on the edge of the field.

               INT. HANGAR -- DAY

               We are still moving through light planes, but now we are 
               inside the hangar. Some of the planes have their engine covers 
               open, parts strewn around. Others are partially covered with 
               tarps or have sections missing. There is even a sleek 
               executive jet parked in one corner.

               As we float past the planes we notice a woman leaning against 
               the wing of a Piper Cub, her chest against the wing's trailing 
               edge, her arms spread out to each side, as though flying 
               herself. As we get closer we see that her jacket is pulled 
               open to expose one of her breasts, which rests on the metal 
               of the wing.

               CU breast on metal. CU hard nipple and rivets.

               CU woman -- Catherine. Early thirties, dark, short hair, 
               stylish executive clothes. Her eyes are wide open but 
               unfocussed. A hand grips her shoulder from behind. We follow 
               the hand down behind Catherine and discover a man crouched 
               behind her, kissing her back.

               Catherine is standing on a low mechanic's platform and her 
               skirt has been raised and hooked over the wing's flap. She 
               wears garters and stockings but no panties.

               The man, handsome, cruel-looking, rises up behind her, enters 
               her, kisses her neck. Catherine half closes her eyes. She 
               rotates her pelvis gently against the thrusting.

               EXT. FILM STUDIO -- DAY

               We are floating toward the modest gates of a small film 
               studio; the sign above the gates says 'CineTerra' in Art 
               Deco script.

               INT. FILM STUDIO -- DAY

               We now float through a film set on which a commercial for a 
               mini-van is being shot. Lights are being reset, the van 
               polished for a beauty tracking shot.

               We pick up an assistant director as he strides through the 
               action, looking for someone.

                                     AD
                         I'm looking for James. Has anybody 
                         seen James Ballard? You know who I 
                         mean? The producer of this epic.

               A dolly grip with very close-cropped hair looks up from a 
               section of dolly track which he is adjusting with small wooden 
               wedges.

                                     GRIP
                         I think I saw him in the camera 
                         department.

               INT. FILM STUDIO. CAMERA ROOM -- DAY

               We float toward the door marked CAMERA DEPT. Inside the room 
               we find a young woman, a camera assistant, wearing a T-shirt 
               and heavy woolen socks and work boots and nothing else. She 
               is draped across a table strewn with camera parts, stomach 
               down, head resting on a black, crackle-finish camera magazine, 
               her legs spread.

               Camera parts and cases, tripods, changing bags everywhere.

               A man is behind her, kissing the backs of her thighs.

               We hear the sound of the AD approaching with deliberately 
               heavy footsteps. The AD pauses just outside the door.

                                     AD
                              (off screen)
                         James? James, are you in there? Could 
                         we please get your stamp of approval 
                         on our little tracking shot?

               The man, James, looks up from the woman's thighs.

                                     JAMES
                         Of course. Be there in a minute.

               The camera girl twists around on to her back and throws her 
               legs over James's shoulders.

                                     CAMERA GIRL
                         It'll take more than a minute.

               EXT. BALLARD APT. BALCONY -- NIGHT

               Catherine stands at the railing of the balcony of the Ballard 
               apartment, which overlooks a busy expressway near the airport. 
               Her arms are spread wide as they were in the airplane hangar, 
               only now it is James, her husband, who is standing behind 
               her. They are both half naked, and he is inside her.

               Their sex-making is disconnected, passionless, as though it 
               would disappear if they noticed it. An urgent, uninterrupted 
               flow of cars streams below them.

                                     JAMES
                         Where were you?

                                     CATHERINE
                         In the private aircraft hangar. 
                         Anybody could have walked in.

                                     JAMES
                         Did you come?

                                     CATHERINE
                         No. What about your camera girl? Did 
                         she come?

                                     JAMES
                         We were interrupted. I had to go 
                         back to the set...

               Catherine turns toward James and pulls open her blouse, 
               exposing her left breast. She pulls James's face down and 
               presses her nipple against his cheek.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Poor darling.
                              (pause)
                         What can I do about Karen? How can I 
                         arrange to have her seduce me? She 
                         desperately needs a conquest.

                                     JAMES
                         I've been thinking about that, about 
                         you and Karen.

               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE. LINGERIE DEPARTMENT -- DAY

               James lingers among racks of nightdresses outside a changing 
               cubicle. Monitored by a bored, seen-it-all middle-aged 
               saleswoman, James glances now and then through the curtains 
               to watch Karen help Catherine try on underwear.

               Karen, Catherine's secretary, a moody, unsmiling girl, is 
               methodically involved in the soft technology of Catherine's 
               breasts and the brassières designed to show them off.

               Karen touches Catherine with peculiar caresses, tapping her 
               lightly with the tips of her fingers, first upon the 
               shoulders, along the pink grooves left by her underwear, 
               then across her back, where the metal clasps of her brassière 
               have left a medallion of impressed skin, and finally on the 
               elastic-patterned grooves beneath Catherine's breasts 
               themselves.

               Catherine stands through this in a trance-like state, gabbling 
               to herself in a low voice, as the tip of Karen's right 
               forefinger surreptitiously touches her nipple.

               INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING-LOT -- DAY

               James sits in the car beside his wife. She watches as his 
               fingers move across the control panel, switching on the 
               ignition, the direction indicator, selecting the drive lever, 
               fastening his seat-belt.

               As the car moves off, James puts his free hand between 
               Catherine's thighs.

               INT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               James studies storyboards for an automotive battery 
               commercial, which are spread out over a broad architect's 
               table. He makes notes on each panel of the boards with a 
               sharp pencil.

               As we move around him, we reveal his secretary, Renata, 
               sitting and watching him intently from the vantage point of 
               her corner chair, her hand poised to write down anything he 
               might say in a small, leather-bound notebook.

               From her point of view, we watch James from behind as he 
               works. Every movement he makes -- bending over to correct a 
               panel, manipulating the pencil, touching the sharp point of 
               the pencil to his lip, straightening up again -- provokes a 
               different tiny response from Renata, so attuned to him is 
               she.

               But he says nothing to her, and she remains poised and 
               vigilant.

               EXT. FILM STUDIO. PARKING-LOT -- NIGHT

               James settles into his car -- a boring American four-door 
               sedan -- running through his control-panel routine like a 
               pilot before driving off. This time his routine ends with 
               the switching on of the windshield wipers because it has 
               begun to rain heavily.

               EXT. RAINSWEPT ROAD -- NIGHT

               Driving home from the studio, James hits a deep puddle at 60 
               miles an hour and suddenly finds himself heading into the 
               oncoming lane. The car hits the central reservation with a 
               thump and the offside tire explodes and spins off its rim.

               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- NIGHT

               In the car, James fights desperately for control.

               EXT. RAINSWEPT ROAD -- NIGHT

               The car hurtles across the reservation and, bouncing and 
               slamming down on its suspension, heads up the high-speed 
               exit ramp. Three sedans are barreling down the ramp toward 
               James.

               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- NIGHT

               James pumps the brakes and saws away inexpertly at the wheel. 
               He manages to avoid the first two cars, but the third he 
               strikes head-on.

               At the moment of impact, the man in the passenger seat of 
               the other car is propelled like a mattress from the barrel 
               of a circus cannon through his own windshield and then 
               partially through the windshield of James's car.

               The propelled man's blood spatters James's face and chest, 
               his body coming to rest half inside James's car, its head 
               dangling down into the dark recess of the passenger footwell.

               James's chest hits the steering wheel, his knees crush into 
               the instrument panel, his forehead hits the upper windshield 
               frame. As this happens, James is vaguely conscious of the 
               same thing happening to the woman driving the other car, as 
               though she is a bizarre mirror image.

               Slammed back into their seats after the initial impact, James 
               and the woman look at each other through the shattered 
               windshields, neither able to move. The woman, handsome and 
               intelligent-looking, supported by her seat-belt, stares at 
               James in a curiously formal way, as if unsure what has brought 
               them together.

               Out of the corner of his eye, James can see the hand of the 
               dead passenger, now his passenger, caught on the dashboard 
               and lying palm upwards only a few inches away from him. James 
               squints as he tries to focus on a huge blood-blister, pumped 
               up by the man's dying circulation, which has a distinct triton 
               shape.

               James shifts his focus to the hood ornament of his car, 
               twisted up into the cold mercury-vapor glare of the roadway 
               lights but still intact. It is the same triton imprinted on 
               the palm of the dead passenger, the car manufacturer's logo.

               EXT. RAINSWEPT ROAD -- NIGHT

               Traffic is beginning to back up behind the accident and a 
               growing circle of spectators, some of them pedestrians, some 
               drivers who have left their own cars, begins to form.

               The more adventurous members of the crowd paw hesitantly at 
               the seized doors of the two cars, afraid really to yank them 
               open in case the violence of that act might trigger some 
               further unnamed catastrophe.

               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- NIGHT

               Numbly watching James as she fumbles to undo her seat-belt, 
               the woman in the other crashed car inadvertently jerks open 
               her blouse and exposes her breast to James, its inner curve 
               marked by a dark, strap-like bruise made by her seat-belt.

               In the strange, desperate privacy of this moment, the breast's 
               erect nipple seems somehow, impossibly, a deliberate 
               provocation.

               INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

               We are close on a face having makeup applied to it. It is a 
               very pale, blotchy face, and the makeup is smoothing it, 
               making it appear healthy and even slightly tanned. There are 
               also some crude black stitches in this face, and we realize 
               that it is James's face, and that a very serious Catherine 
               is applying the makeup.

               James's legs are up in a sling, drainage tubes coming from 
               both knees. Wounds on his chest: broken skin around the lower 
               edge of the sternum, where the horn boss had been driven 
               upwards by the collapsing engine compartment; a semicircular 
               bruise, a marbled rainbow, running from one nipple to the 
               other. Stitches in the laceration across the scalp, a second 
               hairline an inch below the original. Unshaven face and 
               fretting hands.

               Catherine is dressed more for a smart lunch with an airline 
               executive than to visit her husband in hospital.

                                     CATHERINE
                         There, that's better.

                                     JAMES
                         Thank you.

               James examines himself in her hand-mirror, staring at his 
               pale, mannequin-like face, trying to read its lines.

               Catherine looks around her as she puts her makeup away. There 
               are twenty-three other beds in the briskly efficient-looking 
               new ward, all of them empty.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Not a lot of action here.

                                     JAMES
                         They consider this to be the airport 
                         hospital. This ward is reserved for 
                         air-crash victims. The beds are kept 
                         waiting.

                                     CATHERINE
                         If I groundloop during my flying 
                         lesson on Saturday you might wake up 
                         and find me next to you.

                                     JAMES
                         I'll listen for you buzzing over.

               Catherine crosses her legs and tries to light a cigarette 
               with a heavy, mechanically complex lighter with which she is 
               obviously unfamiliar.

                                     JAMES
                              (referring to the 
                              lighter)
                         Is that a gift from Wendel? It has 
                         an aeronautical feel to it.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate the 
                         licence approval for our air-charter 
                         firm. I forgot to tell you.

               Catherine finally succeeds in lighting the cigarette. She 
               takes a deep drag. James props himself up on his elbow, 
               breathing with transparent pain.

                                     JAMES
                         That's going well, then.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Well, yes.
                              (pause)
                         You're getting out of bed tomorrow. 
                         They want you to walk.

               James gestures for the cigarette. Catherine puts the warm 
               tip, stained with pink lipstick, into his mouth.

                                     CATHERINE
                         The other man, the dead man, his 
                         wife is a doctor -- Dr Helen 
                         Remington. She's here, somewhere. As 
                         a patient, of course. Maybe you'll 
                         find her in the hallways tomorrow on 
                         your walk.

                                     JAMES
                         And her husband? What was he?

                                     CATHERINE
                         He was a chemical engineer with a 
                         food company.

               A dark-haired student female nurse comes into the ward. She 
               wags a finger at James.

                                     STUDENT NURSE
                         No smoking, please.

               As Catherine retrieves the cigarette from James and stubs it 
               out in a glass, the nurse examines Catherine's glamorous 
               figure, her expensive suit, her jewelry.

                                     STUDENT NURSE
                              (to Catherine)
                         Are you this gentleman's wife? Mrs 
                         Ballard?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Yes.

                                     STUDENT NURSE
                         You can stay for this, then.

               The nurse pulls the bedclothes back and digs the urine bottle 
               from between James's legs. She checks the level and, 
               satisfied, drops it back, flips over the sheets again.

               Both Catherine and James watch her closely, her sly thighs 
               under her gingham, the movement of her breasts as she bends 
               to check the chart at the foot of the bed, the pulse in her 
               throat. The nurse catches them watching her, smiles 
               enigmatically back at them, and leaves.

               Catherine pulls out a manila folder from her bag and slips a 
               set of storyboards for a commercial out of it.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Aida telephoned to say how sorry she 
                         was, but could you look at the 
                         storyboards again, she's made a number 
                         of changes.

               James waves the folder away. Catherine examines his body, 
               aloofly curious.

                                     JAMES
                         Where's the car?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Outside in the visitors' car-park.

                                     JAMES
                         What!? They brought the car here?

                                     CATHERINE
                         My car, not yours. Yours is a complete 
                         wreck. The police dragged it to the 
                         pound behind the station.

                                     JAMES
                         Have you seen it?

                                     CATHERINE
                         The sergeant asked me to identify 
                         it. He didn't believe you'd gotten 
                         out alive.

                                     JAMES
                         It's about time.

                                     CATHERINE
                         It is?

                                     JAMES
                         After being bombarded endlessly by 
                         road-safety propaganda, it's almost 
                         a relief to have found myself in an 
                         actual accident.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS -- NIGHT

               James is taking his walk through the hallways, trundling his 
               IV stand along with him like an awkward pet.

               A white-coated doctor -- Vaughan -- steps into the ward from 
               a room at the end of the hall. He is bare-chested under his 
               white coat. His strong hands carry a briefcase filled with 
               photographs, which he pauses to shuffle through, as though 
               checking a map.

               As James approaches this new visitor, Vaughan's pockmarked 
               jaws chomp on a piece of gum, creating the impression that 
               he might be hawking obscene pictures around the wards, 
               pornographic X-ray plates and blacklisted urinalyses. He 
               sports copious scar tissue around his forehead and mouth, 
               rumpled and puckered as though residues from some terrifying 
               act of violence.

               Vaughan looks James up and down, taking in every detail of 
               his injuries with evident interest.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         James Ballard?

                                     JAMES
                         Yes?

                                     VAUGHAN
                         Crash victim?

                                     JAMES
                         Yes.

               Vaughan shuffles his photos again. James manages to make out 
               the shapes of a few crushed and distorted vehicles caught in 
               lurid, flash-lit news style. Vaughan flips through them 
               distractedly, then with an unexpected, almost flirtatious 
               flourish slides them back into his briefcase and tucks it 
               under his arm.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         We'll deal with these later.

               He flashes James an enigmatic smile, and walks off down the 
               hallway.

               As James turns to continue, a young woman comes out of the 
               same room that Vaughan appeared from and moves toward him, 
               using a dark wooden walking stick. She presses her face into 
               her raised shoulder, possibly to hide the bruise marking her 
               right cheekbone.

               The woman is Dr. Helen Remington, whose husband died in her 
               car crash with James.

               James stops as she approaches. He speaks without thinking.

                                     JAMES
                         Dr. Remington...?

               The woman looks up at James as she continues her approach. 
               She does not falter, but changes her grip on the cane, as if 
               preparing to thrash him across the face with it. She moves 
               her head in a peculiar gesture of the neck, deliberately 
               forcing her injury on him.

               She pauses when she reaches the doorway, waiting for him to 
               step out of her way. James looks down at the scar tissue on 
               her face, a seam left by an invisible zip three inches long, 
               running from the corner of her right eye to the apex of her 
               mouth.

               James is acutely aware of her strong body beneath her mauve 
               bathrobe, her ribcage partly shielded by a sheath of white 
               plaster that runs from one shoulder to the opposite armpit 
               like a classic Hollywood ball-gown.

               James steps aside. Deciding to ignore him, Helen Remington 
               walks stiffly along the communication corridor, parading her 
               anger and her wound.

               INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

               Catherine washes James's body as he lies in his hospital 
               bed, gently exploring his bruises and his wounds.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Both front wheels and the engine 
                         were driven back into the driver's 
                         section, bowing the floor. Blood 
                         still marked the hood, streamers of 
                         black lace running toward the 
                         windshield-wiper gutters.

               Catherine resoaps her right hand from the bar in the wet 
               saucer on the bed tray, a cigarette in her left. James strokes 
               her stockinged thigh as she continues her monologue.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Minute flecks were spattered across 
                         the seat and steering wheel. The 
                         instrument panel was buckled inwards, 
                         cracking the clock and the speedometer 
                         dials. The cabin was deformed, and 
                         there was dust and glass and plastic 
                         flakes everywhere inside. The 
                         carpeting was damp and stank of blood 
                         and other body and machine fluids.

                                     JAMES
                         You should have gone to the funeral.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I wish I had. They bury the dead so 
                         quickly -- they should leave them 
                         lying around for months.

                                     JAMES
                         What about his wife? The woman doctor? 
                         Have you visited her yet?

                                     CATHERINE
                         No, I couldn't. I feel too close to 
                         her.

               EXT. ROAD HOME FROM HOSPITAL -- DAY

               Catherine and James travel home in the back seat of a taxi. 
               Learning against the rear window of the taxi, James finds 
               himself flinching with excitement toward the approaching 
               traffic streams, which now seem threatening and super-real.

               Catherine watches him, aware that he is over-exhilarated, 
               very excited herself by his new sensitivity to the traffic.

               EXT. BALLARD APT. BALCONY -- DAY

               James sits in a reclining chair on the balcony of his 
               apartment, looking down through the anodized balcony rails 
               at the neighborhood ten stories below.

               Cars fill the suburban streets, choking the parking-lots of 
               the supermarkets, ramped on to the pavements. Two minor 
               accidents have caused a massive tail-back along the flyover 
               which crosses the entrance tunnel to the airport. In one of 
               them, a white laundry-van has bumped into the back of a sedan 
               filled with wedding guests.

               James gazes raptly down at this immense motion sculpture, 
               this incomprehensible pinball machine.

               Catherine comes on to the balcony, kneels down beside him, 
               begins to toy lovingly with the scars on his knees.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Renata tells me you're going to rent 
                         a car.

                                     JAMES
                         I can't sit on this balcony forever. 
                         I'm beginning to feel like a potted 
                         plant.

                                     CATHERINE
                         How can you drive? James... your 
                         legs. You can barely walk.

                                     JAMES
                         Is the traffic heavier now? There 
                         seem to be three times as many cars 
                         as there were before the accident.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I've never really noticed. Is Renata 
                         going with you?

                                     JAMES
                         I thought she might come along. 
                         Handling a car again might be more 
                         tiring than I imagine.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I'm amazed that she'll let you drive 
                         her.

                                     JAMES
                         You're not envious?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Maybe I am a little.
                              (rising)
                         James, I've got to leave for the 
                         office. Are you going to be all right?

               INT. BALLARD APT. GARAGE -- DAY

               James stands at the entrance to his apartment building's 
               underground garage. Only about a dozen cars are there; most 
               of them have been driven to work. James walks among those 
               that remain, absorbing the details of the personal things 
               left in them -- a silk scarf lies on a rear window-sill, a 
               pair of sunglasses hooked over a carpeted transmission hump.

               James stops in front of the empty bay marked 'Balladr'. He 
               stares at the familiar pattern of oil-stains marking the 
               cement.

               INT. RENTED CAR -- DAY

               A steering wheel, an instrument panel, a windshield. Renata's 
               hips gripped by the fabric of the passenger seat, her legs 
               stowed out of sight beneath her red plastic raincoat. James 
               drives Renata in a rented car, his first drive since the 
               accident.

               EXT. FIRST CRASH SITE -- DAY

               The rented car slows and stops on the concrete verge a few 
               yards from the spot where James's crash took place.

               INT. RENTED CAR -- DAY

                                     RENATA
                         Are we allowed to park here?

                                     JAMES
                         No.

                                     RENATA
                         I'm sure the police would make an 
                         exception in your case.

               James unbuttons Renata's raincoat and places his hand on her 
               thigh. She lets him kiss her throat, holding his shoulder 
               reassuringly, like an affectionate governess.

                                     JAMES
                         There's still a patch of blood there 
                         on the road. Did you see it?

                                     RENATA
                         I saw the blood. It looks like motor 
                         oil.

                                     JAMES
                         You were the last one I saw just 
                         before the accident. Do you remember? 
                         We made love.

                                     RENATA
                         Are you still involving me in your 
                         crash?

               An airline coach passes, the passengers bound for Milan 
               staring down at the couple in the car. Renata buttons her 
               coat.

               EXT. FIRST CRASH SITE -- DAY

               James steps from the car, his right knee giving way after 
               the effort of driving. At his feet lies a litter of dead 
               leaves, cigarette cartons and small drifts of safety-glass 
               crystals.

               A hundred yards behind them, a dusty old Lincoln is also 
               parked on the verge. The leather-jacketed driver watches 
               James through his mudspattered windshield, broad shoulders 
               hunched against the door pillar. As James crosses the road 
               the man picks up a camera fitted with a zoom lens and peers 
               at James through the eye-piece.

               Spotting the man, Renata opens the car door for James.

                                     RENATA
                         Who is that man? Is he a private 
                         detective?

               James gets back into the car.

               INT. RENTED CAR -- DAY

                                     RENATA
                         Can you drive?

                                     JAMES
                         I can drive.

               James shifts the car into gear and cruises slowly toward the 
               man with the camera. As they approach him, he gets out of 
               his own car, ignoring them, and kneels down to study the 
               hieroglyphics of the skid marks on the road surface.

               As James and Renata drive past the kneeling man, the sunlight 
               highlights the ridges of scars on his forehead and around 
               his mouth.

               The man looks up at James and he recognizes Vaughan, the 
               young doctor he last saw in the hallway at the airport 
               hospital.

               EXT. AIRFIELD. HANGAR -- DAY

               James proudly shows off his new car to Catherine and Karen 
               at their offices at the airport. The car is identical to the 
               one he crashed.

               James sits sideways in the driver's seat, door open, weirdly 
               jaunty.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I can't believe you've done this.

                                     KAREN
                         This is the exact same car as your 
                         old one, isn't it?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Yes, it is.
                              (to James)
                         Are you planning to have another car 
                         crash?

                                     JAMES
                         I'm not thinking about the crash at 
                         all.

               James is telling the truth. What he is thinking about is the 
               way that Karen's hip casually brushes against Catherine's 
               hip, without either woman seeming to be conscious of it.

               EXT. POLICE POUND -- DAY

               James enters the gate of the police pound on foot, and shows 
               his pass to the guard at the gate. His pass now stamped, he 
               hesitates for a beat before he enters.

               INT. POLICE POUND -- DAY

               Some twenty or so crashed vehicles are parked in the sunlight 
               against the rear wall of an abandoned cinema. At the far end 
               of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin 
               has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abruptly 
               contracted around the body of the driver.

               Unnerved by these deformations, James moves from one car to 
               the next until he comes to his own. The remains of towing 
               tackle are attached to the front bumper, and the body panels 
               are splashed with oil and dirt. He peers through the windows 
               into the cabin, runs his hand over the mud-stained glass.

               Without thinking, he kneels in front of the car and stares 
               at the crushed fenders and radiator grill.

               Two policemen cross the yard with a black Alsatian dog. They 
               watch James hovering around his car as if they vaguely resent 
               his touching it. When they are gone, he unlatches the driver's 
               door and, with an effort, pulls it open.

               James eases himself on to the dusty vinyl seat, tipped back 
               by the bowing of the floor. He nervously lifts his legs into 
               the car and places his feet on the rubber cleats of the 
               pedals, which have been forced out of the engine compartment 
               so that his knees are pressed against his chest.

               The two policemen are exercising their dog across the yard. 
               James opens the glove compartment, forcing the shelf 
               downwards. Inside, covered with dirt and flaked plastic, are 
               a set of route maps, a mildly pornographic novel, a polaroid 
               of Renata sitting in the car near a water reservoir with her 
               breasts exposed.

               James pulls open the ashtray, which promptly jumps on to his 
               lap, releasing a dozen lipstick-smeared butts.

               Someone passes in front of the car. A policeman's voice calls 
               from the gatehouse. Through the windshield, James sees a 
               woman in a white raincoat walking along the line of wrecked 
               cars. The woman -- Helen Remington -- approaches the car 
               next to his, a crushed convertible involved in a massive 
               rear-end collision.

               James sits quietly behind the steering wheel. Helen turns 
               from the convertible. She glances at the hood of James's 
               car, clearly not recognizing the vehicle that killed her 
               husband. As she raises her head she sees James through the 
               glassless windshield frame, sitting behind the deformed 
               steering wheel among the dried bloodstains of her husband.

               Helen's strong eyes barely change their focus, but one hand 
               rises involuntarily to her cheek. She takes in the damage to 
               the car, then takes in James. Without giving away anything, 
               she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns and 
               comes back as James gets out of his car.

               She gestures toward the damaged vehicles, then speaks to 
               James as though continuing a conversation already in progress.

                                     HELEN
                         After this sort of thing, how do 
                         people manage to look at a car, let 
                         alone drive one?
                              (pause)
                         I'm trying to find Charles's car.

                                     JAMES
                         It's not here. Maybe the police are 
                         still holding it. Their forensic 
                         people...

                                     HELEN
                         They said it was here. They told me 
                         this morning.

               She peers critically at James's car, as if puzzled by its 
               distorted geometry.

                                     HELEN
                         This is your car?

               She reaches out a gloved hand and touches the radiator grill, 
               feeling a chrome pillar torn from the accordion, as if 
               searching for some trace of her husband's presence among the 
               blood-spattered paintwork.

                                     JAMES
                         You'll tear your gloves.

               James gently takes her hand and moves it away from the grill.

                                     JAMES
                         I don't think we should have come 
                         here. I'm surprised the police don't 
                         make it more difficult.

                                     HELEN
                         Were you badly hurt? I think we saw 
                         each other at the hospital.
                              (pause)
                         I don't want the car. In fact, I was 
                         appalled to find that I have to pay 
                         a small fee to have it scrapped.

                                     JAMES
                         Can I give you a lift?
                              (almost apologetically)
                         I somehow find myself driving again.

               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- DAY

               James is driving Helen Remington away from the police pound.

                                     JAMES
                         You haven't told me where we're going.

                                     HELEN
                         Haven't I? To the airport, if you 
                         could.

               At these words, James is stricken by an odd feeling of loss.

                                     JAMES
                         The airport? Why? Are you leaving?

                                     HELEN
                         Not yet -- though not soon enough 
                         for some people, I've already found. 
                         A death in the doctor's family makes 
                         the patients doubly uneasy.

                                     JAMES
                         I take it you're not wearing white 
                         to reassure them.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want 
                         to.

                                     JAMES
                         So -- why the airport?

                                     HELEN
                         I work in the immigration department 
                         there.

               James is very aware that, as they speak, Helen is intently 
               watching his hands and feet operating the controls of the 
               car, perceiving these motions in a way that she never would 
               have before her crash with him.

               He, in turn, has trouble taking his eyes off her facial scars, 
               which she now makes no attempt to hide.

               She pulls a cigarette packet from the pocket of her raincoat. 
               She searches the instrument panel for the lighter, her right 
               hand hovering above his knees like a nervous bird.

               Having found the lighter, her strong hands tear away the 
               cellophane from the cigarette pack.

                                     HELEN
                         Do you want a cigarette? I started 
                         to smoke at the hospital. It's rather 
                         stupid of me.

                                     JAMES
                              (suddenly very agitated)
                         Look at all this traffic. I'm not 
                         sure I can deal with it.

                                     HELEN
                         It's much worse now. You noticed 
                         that, did you? The day I left the 
                         hospital I had the extraordinary 
                         feeling that all these cars were 
                         gathering for some special reason I 
                         didn't understand. There seemed to 
                         be ten times as much traffic.

                                     JAMES
                         Are we imagining it?

               Helen waves her cigarette in a gesture that takes in the 
               whole interior of the car.

                                     HELEN
                         You've bought yourself exactly the 
                         same car again. It's the same shape 
                         and colour.

               EXT. FIRST CRASH SITE -- DAY

               They are now passing the spot where their crash took place. 
               Intimidated by the aggressive traffic around him, James allows 
               the front wheel of the car to strike the curb of the central 
               reservation, throwing a tornado of dust and cigarette packs 
               on to the windshield.

               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- DAY

               The car swerves from the fast lane and veers toward an airline 
               coach coming out of the exit ramp. Helen quickly shifts to 
               the left of her seat and, pressing her shoulder against 
               James's, closes her hand over James's hand on the wheel.

               With Helen's help, James just manages to pull the car behind 
               the coach.

               They watch the cars swerving past on both sides of them, 
               horns sounding.

                                     HELEN
                         Turn up here into the car-park. It 
                         won't be busy this time of day.

               INT. AIRPORT CAR-PARK -- DAY

               The car winds its way slowly up the rampways leading to higher 
               and higher parking levels. James finds the rhythm soothing 
               and begins to calm down.

                                     HELEN
                         I've found that I enjoy burying myself 
                         in heavy traffic. I like to look at 
                         it. Yesterday I hired a taxi-driver 
                         to drive me around for an hour. 
                         'Anywhere,' I said. We sat in a 
                         massive traffic jam under an off-
                         ramp. I don't think we moved more 
                         than fifty yards.
                              (pause)
                         I'm thinking of taking up a new job 
                         with the Road Research Laboratory. 
                         They need a medical officer. The 
                         salary is larger -- something I've 
                         got to think about now. There's a 
                         certain moral virtue in being 
                         materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. 
                         Well, it's a new approach for me, in 
                         any case.

                                     JAMES
                         The Road Research Laboratory? Where 
                         they simulate car crashes?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes.

                                     JAMES
                         Isn't that rather too close...?

                                     HELEN
                         That's the point. Besides, I know I 
                         can give something now that I wasn't 
                         remotely aware of before. It's not a 
                         matter of duty so much as of 
                         commitment.

               They have now reached the top level of the multi-story car-
               park, and James pulls into a parking spot overlooking a major 
               runway. An immense jumbo jet is maneuvering into its take-
               off position.

               James turns off the car and puts his arms around Helen. She 
               offers no resistance, as though the whole scenario were well 
               understood and agreed upon. James kisses her mouth, her 
               eyelids, unzips her dress.

               With the jet engines screaming for accompaniment, Helen lifts 
               her right breast from her brassière, pressing James's fingers 
               against the hot nipple. Helen now straddles him and, awkwardly 
               meshing with the technology around them, they make love in 
               the driver's seat of the car.

               INT. BALLARD APT. -- NIGHT

               James and Catherine make love in the same position as in the 
               preceding scene.

               James's thoughts keep flashing back to himself and Helen in 
               his car, the images mixing confusingly with his present 
               lovemaking to Catherine.

               INT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- DAY

               James is back in his office, but it is obvious that he is 
               only nibbling at the work that has piled up in his absence. 
               Renata comes in.

                                     RENATA
                         I almost forgot to give you this. 
                         Probably because I know you're going 
                         to like it.

               Renata hands James a brown manila envelope with no markings 
               on it.

                                     JAMES
                         What is it?

                                     RENATA
                         A complimentary ticket for a special 
                         stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely 
                         not part of the big auto show. There's 
                         a map in the packet and a note 
                         requesting you be discreet about the 
                         location.

                                     JAMES
                         Really? What kind of exhibition is 
                         it?

                                     RENATA
                         I suspect it involves re-enactments 
                         of famous car crashes. You know, 
                         Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert 
                         Camus...

                                     JAMES
                         You're kidding.

                                     RENATA
                         Serious. But you'll have to take 
                         your new friend, the female crash-
                         test dummy. She dropped it off for 
                         you.

                                     JAMES
                         You're not jealous, are you? You 
                         have to understand... Helen and I 
                         had this strange, intense... 
                         experience together.

               Renata kisses him hard, then bites his lip. James pulls away 
               in surprise.

                                     RENATA
                         We've had a few of those ourselves, 
                         haven't we?

               Renata turns on her heel and floats out the door, leaving 
               James to contemplate the contents of the envelope.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

               We are looking at the words 'Little Bastard' written in black 
               script on silver metal, enamel on unpainted aluminum. We 
               pull back to reveal the entire metal object, which is a 1955 
               Porsche 550 Spyder race car. It is small and curvaceous, and 
               is being fussed over by several men in overalls. The number 
               '130' is painted on its hood and doors.

               The Porsche sits on a country road, two-lane blacktop, heavily 
               wooded, lit by a series of movie lights. On the hills lining 
               the road a few rough wooden stands have been erected.

               A blond man -- Vaughan -- stands near the rear of the Porsche, 
               a microphone in his hand. His voice floats eerily out of the 
               woods from speakers mounted on a series of pine trees.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (over speakers)
                         'Don't worry, that guy's gotta see 
                         us!' These were the confident last 
                         words of the brilliant young Hollywood 
                         star James Dean as he piloted his 
                         Porsche 550 Spyder race car toward a 
                         date with death on a lonely stretch 
                         of California two-lane blacktop, 
                         Route 466. 'Don't worry, that guy's 
                         gotta see us.' The year, 1955; the 
                         day, September thirtieth; the time: 
                         now.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. GRANDSTAND -- NIGHT

               Helen and James sit in a half-empty stand, looking down at 
               the road from amid the trees. Helen has her arm around James's 
               waist, her face touching his shoulder.

                                     JAMES
                         It's strange -- I thought all this 
                         would be far more popular.

               Helen is consulting a yellow program sheet.

                                     HELEN
                         The real thing is available free of 
                         charge. Besides, it's not quite legal. 
                         They can't advertise.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (over speakers)
                         The first star of our show is 'Little 
                         Bastard', James Dean's racing Porsche. 
                         He named it after himself, and had 
                         his racing number, 130, painted on 
                         it.

                                     JAMES
                         Who is that? The announcer. Do I 
                         know him?

                                     HELEN
                         That's Vaughan. He talked to you at 
                         the hospital.

                                     JAMES
                         Oh, yes. I thought he was a medical 
                         photographer, doing some sort of 
                         accident research. He wanted every 
                         conceivable detail about our crash.

                                     HELEN
                         When I first met Vaughan, he was a 
                         specialist in international 
                         computerized traffic systems. I don't 
                         know what he is now.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (over speakers)
                         The second star is stuntman and former 
                         race driver -- Colin Seagrave, who 
                         will drive our replica of James Dean's 
                         car.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

               Seagrave, a coarse and burly man, wriggles his way behind 
               the wheel of the delicate little race car without 
               acknowledging the cheers of the crowd. He wears James Dean 
               clothes -- a red windbreaker, a white T-shirt, jeans, loafers, 
               prescription glasses with clip-on sunshades.

               As he talks, Vaughan tours the phalanx of tripod-mounted 
               cameras to check their placement, and chats off-mike with 
               the pair of cameramen with hand-held cameras. He seems to be 
               more the director of the event, possibly the ringmaster, 
               than an actor in it.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (over speakers)
                         I myself shall play the role of James 
                         Dean's racing mechanic, Rolf 
                         Wütherich, sent over from the Porsche 
                         factory in Zuffenhausen, Germany. 
                         This mechanic was himself fated to 
                         die in a car crash in Germany twenty-
                         six years later. And the third and 
                         in some ways most important party, 
                         the college student Donald Turnupseed, 
                         played by movie stuntman Brett Trask.

               Trask, slim and wiry, wearing loafers and a blazer, waves 
               his hand and gets into a replica of Turnupseed's two-tone, 
               black-and-white 1950 Ford sedan. He starts up the Ford, which 
               smokes badly, and drives it up the hill about 100 yards.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (over speakers)
                         Turnupseed was on his way back to 
                         his home in Fresno for the weekend. 
                         James Dean was on his way to an 
                         automobile race in Salinas, a dusty 
                         town in northern California. The two 
                         would only meet for one moment, but 
                         it was a moment that would create a 
                         Hollywood legend.

               At this point Vaughan, who is dressed in light-blue cotton 
               1950s mechanics' overalls, sees James and Helen in the thin 
               crowd and waves to them, as though they were long-standing 
               aficionados of crash spectacles. He doesn't wait to see if 
               they react, but immediately steps into the passenger side of 
               the Porsche, microphone still in hand.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (over speakers)
                         You'll notice that we are not wearing 
                         helmets or safety padding of any 
                         kind, and our cars are not equipped 
                         with roll cages or seat-belts. We 
                         depend solely on the skill of our 
                         drivers for our safety, so that we 
                         can bring you the ultimate in 
                         authenticity. All right, here we go. 
                         The fatal crash of James Dean!

               Vaughan hands the microphone to a stills cameraman who also 
               functions as an assistant, and then sinks down into the silver 
               car.

               Seagrave starts the Porsche, which settles quickly into a 
               husky idle. A few blips of the throttle, and then the Porsche 
               is reversed down to the edge of the lighted strip of road.

               When the Porsche stops, the excited crowd goes quiet. An 
               assistant with a walkie-talkie kneels beside the silver car 
               on the driver's side, co-ordinating the start with his 
               opposite number standing next to the Ford over the hill.

               There is a calculated pause before anything happens, and 
               then the Porsche spins its wheels and accelerates up the 
               hill.

               From their vantage point in the stand, James and Helen can 
               clearly see that the Ford has also started and that the two 
               cars are headed toward each other, each in its respective 
               lane.

               The Porsche accelerates hard, the Ford lumbers along at a 
               moderate pace, swaying clumsily on its soft springs.

               As the cars approach each other, James notices a fresh 
               clearing at the side of the road at just about the point 
               where they seem likely to pass. Sure enough, when the cars 
               are about thirty yards apart, the Ford wanders over the center 
               line. As the Porsche approaches it, it seems to move back 
               into its own lane, but then suddenly swerves again as though 
               making a left turn.

               The Porsche, in its turn, swerves to avoid the big American 
               car but they collide, the immense chrome grill punching into 
               the side of the fragile race car, crumpling it like a wad of 
               tin foil and shunting it unceremoniously off the road into 
               the clearing that has been prepared for it.

               As the Porsche hobbles to a stop, Vaughan seems to stand up 
               on his seat and then throw himself out of the car, rolling 
               over what's left of the front hood on to the ground. Seagrave 
               remains slumped in the driver's seat. Vaughan lies still 
               where he lands, a few feet ahead of the crumpled nose of the 
               race car.

               The door of the Ford opens and Trask stumbles out. He begins 
               to walk around in a dazed and agitated manner, and the crowd, 
               which has been buzzing, goes silent again. Trask walks away 
               from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at the 
               edge of the road.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. GRANDSTAND -- NIGHT

               There is no movement from either Seagrave or Vaughan. James 
               is not sure how to react, but Helen seems genuinely worried.

                                     JAMES
                         Is that part of the act or are they 
                         really hurt?

                                     HELEN
                         I don't know. You can never be sure 
                         with Vaughan. This is his show.

               A stills cameraman runs out of nowhere and kneels beside the 
               apparently stricken Vaughan in the weeds at the side of the 
               road. It is not clear whether he is taking his picture or 
               ministering to him. It soon becomes clear that he has handed 
               him a radio microphone because Vaughan's low, melodramatic 
               growl now ripples out of the woods from the tree speakers.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (over speakers)
                         Rolf Wütherich was thrown from the 
                         Porsche and spent a year in the 
                         hospital recovering from his injuries. 
                         Donald Turnupseed was found wandering 
                         around in a daze, basically unhurt. 
                         James Dean died of a broken neck and 
                         became immortal.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

               Vaughan now leaps to his feet, hands raised in triumph. 
               Seagrave stirs behind the wheel, then raises his hands. Trask 
               emerges from the woods, waving to the now-supercharged crowd.

               Seagrave tries to get out of the collapsed Porsche but is 
               jammed behind the wheel. Without missing a beat, Vaughan 
               dances over to the car and begins to haul Seagrave out of 
               his seat.

                                     COLIN
                         Hold me. I'm dizzy. I can't stand 
                         up.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. GRANDSTAND -- NIGHT

               Helen stands up as the crowd buzzes.

                                     HELEN
                         I know that man, Seagrave, the stunt 
                         driver. I think he's genuinely hurt.

               Helen makes her way down the rickety grandstand steps toward 
               the road, and James follows her.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

               Just as James and Helen step on the road, six police cars, 
               lights flashing and sirens wailing, converge on the lit 
               stretch of road, three from each end. They screech to a halt 
               and dozens of cops pour out of the cars.

               The crowd panics and streams down from the grandstand on to 
               the road. A loudspeaker mounted on one of the police cars 
               begins to blare.

                                     POLICE
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         This is an illegal and unauthorized 
                         automotive demonstration which is in 
                         contravention of the Highway Traffic 
                         Act. You are all liable to fines and 
                         possible arrest and confinement... 
                         Disperse at once! Disperse at once!

               Because James and Helen are just in advance of the first 
               wave of spectators, they manage to link up with Vaughan as 
               he helps haul a still-groggy Seagrave off the road and into 
               the woods. Helen takes Seagrave's free arm.

                                     HELEN
                              (to Vaughan)
                         What's the matter with Seagrave?

                                     VAUGHAN
                         Hit his head, I think. His balance 
                         is off.

               The police spread out through the crowd, collaring people at 
               random before they are able to escape into the woods.

               EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT

               James and Helen help Vaughan hustle Seagrave through the 
               woods. The din of the roadway fades away behind them.

                                     JAMES
                         Why are the police taking this all 
                         so seriously?

                                     VAUGHAN
                         It's not the police. It's the 
                         Department of Transport. Internal 
                         politics. It's a joke. They have no 
                         idea who we really are.

               In the gathering darkness of the woods, it is apparent that 
               James doesn't really know who they are either.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- NIGHT

               Vaughan drives the Lincoln through a scarred, bleak landscape. 
               In the front seat with him are Helen and James. Seagrave is 
               lying down in the back seat with his eyes closed.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         That was glib, wasn't it? 'James 
                         Dean died of a broken neck and became 
                         immortal.' But I couldn't resist.

               Vaughan puts his hand between Helen's thighs. She seems not 
               to notice, but her eyes close dreamily every once in a while. 
               James watches microscopically.

               Sometimes, when the flow of traffic allows, Vaughan stares 
               intently at James while his hand works away between Helen's 
               thighs, and James looks away, flushed, like a schoolgirl.

               EXT. SEAGRAVE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

               The Lincoln turns into the forecourt of Seagrave's garage 
               and showroom. His business, which has clearly seen better 
               days, is hot-rodding and customized cars. Behind the unwashed 
               glass of the showroom is a fiberglass replica of a 1930s 
               Brooklands racer, faded bunting stuffed into the seat.

               They get out of the car, helping the woozy Seagrave through 
               the door at the side of the showroom, which leads to the 
               stairway up to the apartment above the garage.

               INT. SEAGRAVE APT. -- NIGHT

               The Seagrave apartment is dirty and depressing, featuring 
               cheap, cigarette-scarred leatherette furniture.

               James watches Helen and Vaughan steer Seagrave into the living-
               room, where two people sit on a couch watching television 
               with the sound turned off: Gabrielle, a sharp-faced young 
               woman who is rolling a hash joint; and Seagrave's wife, Vera, 
               a handsome, restless woman of about thirty.

               Vera stands as they come in and rushes over to the shaky 
               Seagrave.

                                     VERA
                         Oh, God. What happened? Here, lie 
                         down.

               Vera and Helen lay the confused Seagrave down on the three-
               seat sofa, while Vaughan sits next to Gabrielle and helps 
               her prepare another hash joint. James, awkwardly left 
               standing, notices long scars on Vera's thighs and legs.

                                     HELEN
                         They did the James Dean crash. It 
                         seemed to go perfectly. But he started 
                         to feel nauseous on the way back. 
                         I'm sure it's concussion.

                                     VERA
                         Ah, well... We're familiar enough 
                         with that, then, aren't we?

               James watches Gabrielle and Vaughan. As she rolls a small 
               piece of resin in a twist of silver foil, Vaughan brings a 
               brass lighter out of his hip pocket. Gabrielle cooks the 
               resin, and shakes the powder into the open cigarette waiting 
               in the roller machine on her lap.

               On Gabrielle's legs are traces of what seem to be gas bacillus 
               scars, faint circular depressions on the kneecaps. She notices 
               James staring at her scars, but makes no effort to close her 
               legs.

               On the sofa beside her is a chromium metal cane and, as she 
               shifts her weight, James sees that the instep of each leg is 
               held in the steel clamp of a surgical support. It now becomes 
               obvious from the over-rigid posture of her waist that she is 
               also wearing a back-brace of some kind.

               Gabrielle rolls another cigarette out of the machine, but 
               does not offer it to James. Instead, Vaughan gets up and 
               takes it over to Seagrave, who has managed to sit up.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         I'd really like to work out the 
                         details of the Jayne Mansfield crash 
                         with you. We could do the decapitation -- 
                         her head embedded in the windshield -- 
                         and the little dead dog thing as 
                         well. You know, the Chihuahuas in 
                         the back seat. I've got it figured 
                         out.

               Seagrave takes the lit joint and draws heavily on it. He 
               holds the smoke in his lungs for a while, studies the grease 
               on his hands before he answers.

                                     COLIN
                         You know I'll be ready, Vaughan. But 
                         I'll want to wear really big tits -- 
                         out to here -- so the crowd can see 
                         them get cut up and crushed on the 
                         dashboard.

               James turns to go, leaving Helen to her conversation with 
               Vera, but Vaughan follows him through the door, holding his 
               arm in a powerful grip.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         Don't leave yet, Ballard. I want you 
                         to help me.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

               James follows Vaughan down a cramped corridor to a 
               photographic workshop formed out of a warren of small rooms. 
               Vaughan eases James into the first room and then carefully 
               closes the door behind them.

                                     JAMES
                         Do you live here? With Seagrave?

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (laughs)
                         I live in my car. This is my workshop.

               Pinned to the walls and lying on the benches among the enamel 
               pails are hundreds of photographs. The floor around the 
               enlarger is littered with half-plate prints, developed and 
               cast aside once they have yielded their images. Vaughan makes 
               a sweeping gesture that takes in all the photographs.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         And this is the new project, Ballard.

               As Vaughan hunts around the central table, turning the pages 
               of a leather-bound album, James looks down at the discarded 
               prints below his feet. Most of them are crude frontal pictures 
               of motor-cars and heavy vehicles involved in highway 
               collisions, surrounded by spectators and police, and close-
               ups of impacted radiator grills and windshields.

               Vaughan opens the album at random and hands it to James. He 
               leans back against the door and watches as James adjusts the 
               desk lamp.

               The first thirty pages record the crash, hospitalization, 
               and post-recuperative romance of the young woman Gabrielle --
               a social worker, the photos suggest -- who is currently 
               getting very stoned in the next room.

               By coincidence, her small sports car had collided with an 
               airline bus at the entry to the airport not far from the 
               site of James's own accident. Vaughan had obviously been 
               there, shooting film, moments after the crash. The incredibly 
               detailed photos end with her affair with her physical therapy 
               instructor.

               The remainder of the album describes the course of James's 
               own accident and recovery, and includes his sexual encounters 
               with Renata, Helen Remington, and his own wife, Catherine. 
               Vaughan stands at James's shoulder, like an instructor ready 
               to help a promising pupil.

               James closes the book.

                                     JAMES
                         What kind of help can I possibly be 
                         to you? You seem to be everywhere at 
                         once as it is.

               At that moment, there is a knock at the door, and then 
               Gabrielle enters and takes a few stiff steps into the room 
               on her shackled legs. She holds out a couple of joints to 
               Vaughan.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Thought you might be missing these.
                              (to James)
                         So here you are at the nerve centre. 
                         Vaughan makes everything look like a 
                         crime, doesn't he?

               Vaughan takes the joints and lights them both. He hands one 
               to James, who takes it gratefully.

                                     JAMES
                         What exactly is your project, Vaughan? 
                         A book of crashes? A medical study? 
                         A sensational documentary? Global 
                         traffic?

                                     VAUGHAN
                         It's something we're all intimately 
                         involved in: the reshaping of the 
                         human body by modern technology.

               INT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- DAY

               James watches Renata and Catherine talking animatedly at the 
               other end of his office. He can't hear what they are saying, 
               but Renata is showing Catherine layouts of ads involving 
               images of private planes flying in formation. They touch 
               each other from time to time without seeming to notice it, 
               but James notices it.

               EXT. VARIOUS LARGE CITY ROADS -- DAY

               James and Catherine set off for home in their own separate 
               cars. At times, they are within sight of each other and James 
               watches her microscopically, as though he didn't know her, 
               as though, perhaps, she isn't human.

               At one point he sees her with her hands resting on the 
               steering wheel, her right index finger picking at an old 
               adhesive label on the windshield.

               And then, abruptly, James is aware of the dented fender of 
               Vaughan's Lincoln only a few feet behind Catherine's sports 
               car.

               Vaughan now surges past James, crowding along the roadway as 
               if waiting for Catherine to make a mistake. Startled, 
               Catherine takes refuge in front of an airline bus in the 
               nearside lane. Vaughan drives alongside the bus, using his 
               horn and lights to force the driver back, and again cuts in 
               behind Catherine.

               James moves ahead along the center lane, shouting to Vaughan 
               as he passes him, but Vaughan is signalling to Catherine, 
               pumping his headlights at her rear fender.

               Without thinking, Catherine pulls into the courtyard of a 
               filling station, forcing Vaughan into a heavy U-turn. Tires 
               screaming, he swings around the ornamental flower-bed with 
               its glazed pottery plants, but James blocks his way with his 
               own car.

               Heart racing, Catherine sits still in her car among the fuel 
               pumps, her eyes flashing at Vaughan.

               James steps from his car and walks across to Vaughan, who 
               watches James approach as if he had never seen him before, 
               scarred mouth working on a piece of gum as he gazes at the 
               aircrafts taking off from the airport.

                                     JAMES
                         Vaughan, what the hell are you doing? 
                         Are you trying to create your own 
                         Famous Crash?

               Vaughan hooks his gear lever into reverse.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         It excited her, Ballard. Your wife, 
                         Catherine. She enjoyed it. Ask her.

               Vaughan reverses his car in a wide circle, almost running 
               down a passing pump attendant, and sets off across the early 
               afternoon traffic.

               INT. BALLARD APT. -- NIGHT

               James and Catherine lie naked in bed, she with her back to 
               him, buttocks pressed into his groin. He is inside her.

                                     CATHERINE
                         He must have fucked a lot of women 
                         in that huge car of his. It's like a 
                         bed on wheels. It must smell of 
                         semen...

                                     JAMES
                         It does.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Do you find him attractive?

                                     JAMES
                         He's very pale. Covered with scars.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Would you like to fuck him, though? 
                         In that car?

                                     JAMES
                         No. But when he's in that car...

                                     CATHERINE
                         Have you seen his penis?

                                     JAMES
                         I think it's badly scarred too. From 
                         a motorcycle accident.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Is he circumcised? Can you imagine 
                         what his anus is like? Describe it 
                         to me. Would you like to sodomize 
                         him? Would you like to put your penis 
                         right into his anus, thrust it up 
                         his anus? Tell me, describe it to 
                         me. Tell me what you would do. How 
                         would you kiss him in that car? 
                         Describe how you'd reach over and 
                         unzip his greasy jeans, then take 
                         out his penis. Would you kiss it or 
                         suck it right away? Which hand would 
                         you hold it in? Have you ever sucked 
                         a penis? Do you know what semen tastes 
                         like? Have you ever tasted semen? 
                         Some semen is saltier than others. 
                         Vaughan's semen must be very salty...

               They both have huge orgasms within moments of each other.

               INT. HELEN'S CAR -- DAY

               We are close on the distracted, solicitous face of Helen 
               Remington.

                                     HELEN
                         Have you come?

               Helen Remington and James are having sex in the back seat of 
               Helen's car, Helen sitting on James's lap with her back to 
               him. She dismounts him and touches his shoulder with an 
               uncertain hand, as though he were a patient she had worked 
               hard to revive.

               EXT. AIRPORT CAR-PARK -- DAY

               Helen's car is parked on the upper level of the airport car-
               park, which is currently quite busy. Streams of traffic, 
               both pedestrian and vehicular, flow past the car.

               INT. HELEN'S CAR -- DAY

               James lies against the rear seat of the car while Helen 
               dresses with abrupt movements, straightening her shirt around 
               her hips like a department-store window-dresser jerking a 
               garment on to a mannequin.

                                     JAMES
                         Please finish your story.

                                     HELEN
                         The junior pathologist at Ashford 
                         Hospital. Then the husband of a 
                         colleague of mine, then a trainee 
                         radiologist, then the service manager 
                         at my garage.

                                     JAMES
                         And you had sex with all of these 
                         men in cars? Only in cars?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

                                     JAMES
                         And did you fantasize that Vaughan 
                         was photographing all these sex acts? 
                         As though they were traffic accidents?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes.
                              (laughs)
                         They felt like traffic accidents.

               INT. ROAD RESEARCH LAB -- DAY

               We are witnessing a spectacular road accident re-created 
               under laboratory conditions in the immense confines of the 
               Road Research Lab.

               A motorcycle is in the process of having a head-on collision 
               with a sedan bearing a family of four -- an extremely violent 
               and disturbing crash, despite the use of cradles, dummies, 
               rails, cables and extensive metering and recording technology.

               Among the many witnesses to the crash, including numerous 
               engineers, technicians and Transport Ministry officials, are 
               James, Helen and Vaughan.

               Vaughan is energetically masturbating through his jeans, 
               shielded by a sheaf of publicity folders which he holds in 
               his other hand.

               There is a terrific metallic explosion as the motorcycle 
               strikes the front of the sedan. The two vehicles veer sideways 
               towards the line of startled spectators.

               The motorcyclist and his bike sail over the hood of the car 
               and strike the windshield, then careen across the roof in a 
               black mass of fragments.

               The car plunges ten feet back on its hawsers and comes to 
               rest astride its rails. The hood, windshield and roof have 
               been crushed by the impact. Inside the cabin, the lopsided 
               family lurch across each other, the decapitated torso of the 
               front-seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured 
               windshield.

               The engineers wave to the crowd reassuringly and move toward 
               the motorcycle, which lies on its side fifty yards behind 
               the car. But it is Vaughan -- a black-jacketed figure striding 
               on long, uneven legs -- who arrives first at the bike.

               For a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up himself, 
               but he then backs away to where technicians are picking up 
               pieces of the motorcyclist's body, and then turns away 
               completely and rejoins Helen and James.

               Vaughan holds up the bundle of technical hand-outs in his 
               grip.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         Get all the paper you can, Ballard. 
                         Some of the stuff they're giving 
                         away is terrific: 'Mechanisms of 
                         Occupant Ejection', 'Tolerances of 
                         the Human Face in Crash Impacts'...

               Helen takes James's arm, smiling at him, nodding 
               encouragingly, as if urging a child across some mental hurdle.

                                     HELEN
                         We can have a look at it again on 
                         the monitors. They're showing it in 
                         slow motion.

               An audience of thirty or so gathers at the trestle tables to 
               watch a slowmotion replay on a huge television monitor. As 
               the hypnotic, grotesque ballet unfolds, the crowd's own 
               ghostly images stand silently in the background, hands and 
               faces unmoving while the collision is re-enacted. The dream-
               like reversal of roles makes them seem less real than the 
               mannequins in the car.

               James looks down at the silk-suited wife of a Ministry 
               official standing beside him. Her eyes watch the film with a 
               rapt gaze, as if she were seeing herself and her daughters 
               dismembered in the crash.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               James rides in Vaughan's car. Vaughan drives aggressively, 
               rolling the heavy car along the access roads, holding the 
               battered bumpers a few feet behind any smaller vehicle until 
               it moves out of the way.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         I've always wanted to drive a crashed 
                         car.

                                     JAMES
                         You could get your wish at any moment.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         No, I mean a crash with a history. 
                         Camus's Facel Vega, or Nathaniel 
                         West's station wagon, Grace Kelly's 
                         Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to 
                         get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't 
                         touch anything else.

                                     JAMES
                         Is that why you drive this car? I 
                         take it that you see Kennedy's 
                         assassination as a special kind of 
                         car crash?

                                     VAUGHAN
                         The case could be made.

               They approach a major intersection. For almost the first 
               time on this drive, Vaughan applies the brakes.

               The heavy car sways and goes into a long right-hand slide 
               which carries it across the path of a taxi. Flooring the 
               accelerator, Vaughan swerves in front of it, tires screaming 
               over the blaring horn of the taxi.

               As they settle down, Vaughan reaches behind him and lifts a 
               briefcase off the back seat.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         Take a look at this and tell me what 
                         you think.

               James opens the briefcase and slides out a thick packet of 
               glossy photographs, all of them marked up with coloured ink 
               pens.

               The photos are culled from a variety of sources -- newspapers, 
               magazines, video stills, film frames -- blown up to uniform 
               8' x 10' size. Each one depicts a famous crash victim in the 
               prime of life, and each one has the wounds to come marked up 
               very explicitly -- lines circling their necks and pubic areas, 
               breasts and cheekbones shaded in, section lines across their 
               mouths and abdomens. Handwritten notes complement the circles 
               and arrows.

               A second packet of photographs shows the cars in which these 
               famous people died. Each photo is marked to show which parts 
               of the cars destroyed or fused with which famous body part: 
               for example, a close-up of the dashboard and windshield from 
               the Camus car -- Michel Gallimard's Facel Vega -- is marked 
               'nasal bridge', 'soft palate', 'left zygomatic arch'.

                                     JAMES
                         It's very... satisfying. I'm not 
                         sure I understand why.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         It's the future, Ballard, and you're 
                         already part of it. For the first 
                         time, a benevolent psychopathology 
                         beckons towards us. For example, the 
                         car crash is a fertilizing rather 
                         than a destructive event -- a 
                         liberation of sexual energy that 
                         mediates the sexuality of those who 
                         have died with an intensity impossible 
                         in any other form. To fully understand 
                         that, and to live that... that is my 
                         project.

                                     JAMES
                         What about the reshaping of the human 
                         body by modern technology? I thought 
                         that was your project.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         A crude sci-fi concept that floats 
                         on the surface and doesn't threaten 
                         anybody. I use it to test the 
                         resilience of my potential partners 
                         in psychopathology.

               The traffic has jammed up to a walking pace. Using his horn, 
               Vaughan forces the drivers in the slower lanes to back up 
               and let him across on to the hard shoulder. Once free, he 
               accelerates past the lines of traffic, occasionally scraping 
               the right flank of the Lincoln against the cement divider. 
               In the distance the airport car-park looms.

               INT. AIRPORT CAR-PARK -- DAY

               The Lincoln spirals its way up toward the upper levels of 
               the airport carpark. James just spots a sharp-faced young 
               woman in a very short skirt, an airport whore, provocatively 
               bent over a railing ostensibly to watch airplanes land and 
               take off, when Vaughan slams on the brakes and jumps out of 
               the car.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         You drive.

               The startled James numbly obeys, sliding over into the 
               driver's seat as Vaughan approaches the whore and begins to 
               negotiate with her. James gingerly maneuvers the boat-like 
               car to one side to allow traffic to pass as Vaughan returns 
               with the gum-chewing whore in tow.

               As the girl, with short black hair and a boy's narrow-hipped 
               body, opens the passenger door, Vaughan hands her a joint 
               and lights it for her. Then, lifting her chin, he puts his 
               fingers in her mouth and plucks out the knot of gum, flicking 
               it away into the darkness.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         Let's get rid of that. I don't want 
                         you blowing it up my urethra.

               EXT. AIRPORT ROADS -- NIGHT

               James drives the Lincoln along the bizarrely lighted roads 
               that ring the airport. Vaughan and the whore are in the back 
               seat.

               INT. LINCOLN -- NIGHT

               James adjusts the rear-view mirror so that he can see into 
               the rear seat. Vaughan is having strange, disconnected sex 
               with the whore. James realizes that he can almost control 
               the sexual act behind him by the way in which he drives the 
               car.

               It is, in that sense, a sexual threesome -- or, more properly, 
               a foursome, because the sex between Vaughan and the whore 
               takes place in the hooded grottoes of the luminescent dials, 
               surging needles and blinking lights of the black, brooding 
               Lincoln.

               INT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- DAY

               James and Renata sort through some storyboards together at 
               the architect's table. Renata takes a few cast-offs and walks 
               past the window toward the filing cabinet. She takes a quick 
               peek out the window on her way.

                                     RENATA
                         Your friend's still out there.

               James leaves the table and looks out the window. Vaughan is 
               sitting in his car in the center of the parking-lot. Most of 
               the staff are leaving for home, taking their cars one by one 
               from the slots around Vaughan's dusty limousine.

                                     RENATA
                         What does he want from you?

                                     JAMES
                         Hard to say.

                                     RENATA
                         I'm going to leave now. Do you want 
                         a lift?

                                     JAMES
                         No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.

               EXT. FILM STUDIO. PARKING-LOT -- DUSK

               James walks out into the nearly deserted parking-lot to find 
               two cars parked in front of Vaughan's Lincoln: a police patrol 
               car and Catherine's white sports car.

               One policeman is inspecting the Lincoln, peering through the 
               dusty windows, with Vaughan fidgeting beside him. The other 
               stands beside Catherine's car, questioning her.

               James slows guiltily as both policemen begin to talk to 
               Vaughan. Catherine spots James and walks crisply over to 
               him.

                                     CATHERINE
                         They're questioning Vaughan about an 
                         accident near the airport. Some 
                         pedestrian... they think he was run 
                         over intentionally.

                                     JAMES
                         Vaughan isn't interested in 
                         pedestrians.

               As if taking their cue from this, the policemen walk back to 
               their car. Vaughan watches them go, head raised like a 
               periscope.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You'd better drive him. He's a bit 
                         shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where 
                         is yours?

                                     JAMES
                         At home. I couldn't face all this 
                         traffic.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I'd better come with you, then. Are 
                         you sure you can drive?

               As Catherine and James walk toward Vaughan, he reaches into 
               the rear seat of his car and pulls out a white sweatshirt. 
               As he takes off his denim jacket, the falling light picks 
               out the scars on his naked abdomen and chest, a constellation 
               of white chips that circle his body from the left armpit 
               down to his crotch.

               EXT. JAMMED MOTORWAY -- NIGHT

               The Lincoln has entered an immense traffic jam, and brake-
               lights flare in the evening air. Vaughan sits with one arm 
               out the passenger window. He slaps the door impatiently, 
               pounding the panel with his fist.

               A police car speeds down the descent lane of a flyover, 
               headlights and roof-lamps flashing. Ahead, two policemen 
               steer the traffic from the nearside curb. Warning tripods 
               set up on the pavement flash a rhythmic 'Slow... Slow... 
               Accident... Accident...'

               Eventually, they begin to edge past the accident site, which 
               is lit by a circle of police spotlights. Three vehicles -- a 
               taxi, a limousine and a small sports sedan -- have collided 
               where an on-ramp joins the main roadway. A crowd has gathered 
               on the sidewalks and on the pedestrian bridge that spans the 
               road.

               Beside the taxi, its three passengers lie in a group, blankets 
               swathing their chests and legs. First-aid men work on the 
               driver, an elderly man who sits upright against the fender 
               of his car, face and clothes speckled with drops of blood.

               The limousine's passengers still sit in the deep cabin of 
               their car, their identities sealed behind the starred internal 
               window.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               Catherine has half hidden herself behind the passenger seat. 
               Her steady eyes follow the skid marks and loops of 
               bloodstained oil that cross the familiar macadam like a battle 
               diagram.

               Vaughan, by contrast, leans out the window, both arms ready 
               as if about to seize one of the bodies. In some recess in 
               the back seat he has found a camera, which now swings from 
               his neck.

               Siren whining, a third ambulance drives down the oncoming 
               lane. A police motorcyclist cuts in front of James and slows 
               to a halt, signalling him to wait and allow the ambulance to 
               pass. James stops the car.

               Ten yards from them is the crushed limousine, the body of 
               the young chauffeur still lying on the ground beside it. 
               Three engineers work with surreal hand-tools and hydraulic 
               cutting and prying equipment at the rear doors of the 
               limousine. They sever the jammed door mechanism and pull 
               back the door to expose the passengers trapped inside the 
               compartment.

               The two passengers, a pink-faced man in his fifties wearing 
               a black overcoat, and a younger woman with a pale, anemic 
               skin, still sit upright, staring blankly, in the rear seat.

               A policeman pulls away the traveling rug that covers their 
               legs and waists. The woman's legs are bare, the older man's 
               feet splayed, apparently broken at the ankles. The woman's 
               skirt has ridden up around her waist, and her left hand holds 
               the window strap.

               As the older man turns to the woman, one hand searching for 
               her, he slips sideways off the seat, his ankles kicking at 
               the clutter of leather valises and broken glass.

               The traffic stream moves on. James eases the car forwards. 
               Vaughan raises the camera to his eye, lowering it from sight 
               when an ambulance attendant tries to knock it from his hands.

               The pedestrian bridge passes overhead. Half out of the car, 
               Vaughan peers at the scores of legs pressed against the metal 
               railings, then opens the door and dives out.

               EXT. MOTORWAY VERGE -- NIGHT

               As James pulls the Lincoln on to the verge, Vaughan runs 
               back to the pedestrian bridge, darting in and out of the 
               cars. James and Catherine get out of the car.

               As James closes the door, he notices that the blood of one 
               of the accident victims has somehow been splashed on to the 
               door handle, and that some of it is now on his hand.

               He finds a section of newspaper at the side of the road and 
               wipes the blood off his hand. When he looks up, he realizes 
               that Catherine has followed Vaughan back to the accident 
               site.

               EXT. JAMMED MOTORWAY -- NIGHT

               James walks back alone, eventually spotting them among the 
               throng of spectators, Catherine watching Vaughan's scarred 
               face intently, provocatively, as he photographs every aspect 
               of the accident.

               There is a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the air 
               among the onlookers, and even a congregational feeling as 
               one group of engineers works on the crushed sports sedan, 
               prying at the metal roof which has been flattened on to the 
               heads of the occupants.

               And now Vaughan poses an only slightly reluctant Catherine 
               against the backdrop of the stricken taxi as though she were 
               one of the shaken survivors of the accident.

               When the roof of the sports sedan is levered up, the hair of 
               the driver, its only passenger, comes off with it as though 
               scalped, stuck to the roofliner with drying blood. But it's 
               soon apparent that it's not hair, but rather a cheap, tangled, 
               platinum blond wig.

               Vaughan makes his way over to the sedan, intrigued by the 
               dangling 'scalp', which is almost phosphorescent in the road-
               rescue work lights. Catherine trails obediently behind him, 
               like a harshly disciplined puppy.

               When the body of the driver is exposed to the lights, the 
               effect is doubly grotesque, for not only is the driver dead 
               and partially crushed, but he is also a cross-dresser: 
               Seagrave, in Jayne Mansfield drag. His long, greasy hair is 
               tied up in a knot on his head, he is unshaven, his huge, 
               fake bosom is bloody and askew; his bloated, muscular body 
               strains against the pink 60s skirt and jacket, the blue suede 
               boots with high heels.

               There is also a dead Chihuahua bitch inside the car with 
               Seagrave, which Vaughan manages to move with his foot until 
               a cop, outraged, shoos him away. The dog is stiff with rigor 
               mortis, obviously dead long before the crash.

               An excited Vaughan has spotted James and now approaches him, 
               breathless.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         It's Seagrave. He was worried that 
                         we would never do Jayne Mansfield's 
                         crash, now that the police were 
                         cracking down. So he did it himself.

               Vaughan turns back to look at the wreck again, almost 
               reverent. This is Seagrave's own solitary work of art.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (shakes his head)
                         The dog -- God, the dog is brilliant, 
                         perfect. I wonder where he got it?

               Now Vaughan turns to James, his face flushed, incandescent 
               with joy.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         Come with me, James. I have to 
                         document it.

               Vaughan lopes off toward the Seagrave wreck.

               But James hangs back, watching, as the passengers from the 
               taxi are carried on stretchers to an ambulance. The dead 
               chauffeur of the limousine lies with a blanket over his face, 
               while a doctor and two ambulance men climb into the rear 
               compartment.

               Beyond them, Vaughan begins to snap away at every possible 
               aspect of Seagrave's wreck, beginning with the dead Chihuahua.

               EXT. MOTORWAY VERGE -- NIGHT

               Some time later, as the crowd disperses and the traffic begins 
               to flow normally, James kneels beside the Lincoln and shows 
               Vaughan the blood on his door. Catherine sits in the back 
               seat.

                                     JAMES
                         We must have driven through a pool 
                         of blood. If the police stop you 
                         again, they may impound the car while 
                         they have the blood analyzed.

               Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         You're right, Ballard. There's an 
                         all-night car-wash in the airport 
                         service area.

               Vaughan rises and holds the door open for James, who sits 
               behind the wheel, expecting Vaughan to walk around the car 
               and sit beside him. Instead, Vaughan pulls open the rear 
               door and climbs in beside Catherine.

               As they set off, Vaughan's camera lands on the front seat.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               As they drive, James watches Catherine in the rear-view 
               mirror. She sits in the center of the back seat, elbows 
               forward on her knees, looking over his shoulder at the 
               speeding lights of the expressway. At the first traffic light, 
               she smiles at James reassuringly.

               Vaughan sits like a bored gangster beside her, his left knee 
               leaning against her thigh. One hand rubs his groin absent-
               mindedly. He stares at the nape of her neck, running his 
               eyes along the profiles of her cheek and shoulder.

               EXT. CAR-WASH -- NIGHT

               Near the airport, the Lincoln joins a line of cars waiting 
               their turn to pass through the automatic car-wash. In the 
               darkness, the three nylon rollers drum against the sides and 
               roof of a taxi parked in the washing station, water and soap 
               solution jetting from the metal gantries.

               Fifty yards away, the two night attendants sit in their glass 
               cubicle beside the deserted fuel pumps, reading their comic 
               books and playing a radio.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               The car ahead advances a few yards, its brake-lights 
               illuminating the interior of the Lincoln, covering the trio 
               with a pink sheen. Through the rear-view mirror James sees 
               that Catherine is leaning against the back seat, her shoulder 
               pressed tightly into Vaughan's. Her eyes are fixed on 
               Vaughan's chest, on the scars around his injured nipples, 
               shining like points of light.

               James edges the Lincoln forward a few feet. When he turns 
               around, he sees that Vaughan is holding in his cupped right 
               hand his wife's bare breast.

               James fumbles for change as Vaughan caresses Catherine's 
               nipple in the back seat. Catherine looks down at this breast 
               with rapt eyes, as if seeing it for the first time, fascinated 
               by its unique geometry.

               EXT. CAR-WASH -- NIGHT

               Their car is alone in the washing bay. A voice rings out. 
               Cigarette in hand, one of the attendants stands in the wet 
               darkness, beckoning to James, who inserts his coins in the 
               pay slot and closes the window.

               Water jets on to the car, clouding the windows and shutting 
               the trio into the interior.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               Within their blue grotto, Vaughan lies diagonally across the 
               back seat. Catherine kneels across him, skirt rolled around 
               her waist. The light refracted through the soap solution 
               jetting across the windows covers their bodies with a 
               luminescent glow, like two semi-metallic human beings of the 
               future making love in a chromium bower.

               The gantry engine begins to drum. The rollers pound across 
               the hood of the Lincoln and roar forward to the windshield, 
               driving the soap solution into a whirlwind of froth. Catherine 
               settles over Vaughan, and as the rollers drum against the 
               roof and doors, Vaughan drives his pelvis upwards, almost 
               lifting his buttocks off the seat.

               In the mounting roar of the rollers, she and Vaughan rock 
               together, Vaughan holding her breasts together with his palms 
               as if trying to force them into a single globe. When his 
               hands move away to her buttocks, James can see that her 
               breasts have been bruised by Vaughan's fingers, the marks 
               forming a pattern like crash injuries.

               At just this moment, Catherine looks into James's eyes in an 
               instant of complete lucidity. Her expression shows both irony 
               and affection, an acceptance of a sexual logic they both 
               recognize and have prepared themselves for.

               James sits quietly in the front seat as the white soap sluices 
               across the roof and doors like liquid lace. Catherine cries 
               out, a gasp of pain cut off by Vaughan's strong hand across 
               her mouth. He sits back with her legs across his hips, 
               slapping her with his free hand. His sweaty face is clamped 
               in an expression of anger and distress. The blows raise 
               blunted weals on Catherine's arm and hips.

               EXT. DESERTED MOTORWAY -- NIGHT

               James drives the Lincoln home along a deserted motorway.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               The street-lamps illuminate Vaughan's sleeping face in the 
               rear of the car, scarred mouth lying open like a child's 
               against the sweat-soaked seat.

               Catherine sits forward, freeing herself from Vaughan. She 
               touches James's shoulder in a gesture of domestic affection. 
               In the mirror, James can see the weals on her cheek and neck, 
               the bruised mouth that deforms her nervous smile.

               EXT. BALLARD APT. BUILDING -- NIGHT

               The Lincoln pulls up at the Ballards' apartment building. 
               James and Catherine get out and stand in the darkness beside 
               the now-immaculate black car. Vaughan is still asleep in the 
               back. James takes Catherine's arm to steady her, holding her 
               bag in his hand.

               As they walk toward the entrance, Vaughan gets up and climbs 
               unsteadily behind the steering wheel. Without looking back 
               at James and Catherine, he starts the engine and quietly 
               drives off.

               INT. BALLARD APT. BUILDING. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               In the elevator, James holds Catherine closely, lovingly.

               INT. BALLARD APT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               That night, James kneels over Catherine as she lies diagonally 
               across the bed, her small feet resting on his pillow, one 
               hand over her right breast.

               She watches him with a calm and affectionate gaze as he 
               explores her body and bruises, feeling them gently with his 
               fingers, lips and cheeks, tracing and interpreting the raw 
               symbols that Vaughan's hands and mouth have left across her 
               skin.

               INT. AIRPORT CONVENTION CENTER. AUTO SHOW -- DAY

               James and the crippled Gabrielle visit the annual auto show, 
               which occupies the immense halls of the airport convention 
               center. He watches appreciatively as she swings herself on 
               her shackled legs among the hundreds of cars displayed on 
               their stands.

               Gabrielle approaches the imposing Mercedes stand and, pivoting 
               about on her heels, seems to take immense pleasure from these 
               immaculate vehicles, placing her scarred hands on their 
               paintwork, rolling her injured hips against them like an 
               unpleasant cat.

               She soon draws the attention of a young salesman, who tries 
               hard not to notice her scars and braces.

                                     SALESMAN
                         Is there something here that interests 
                         you?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         The white sports model. Could you 
                         help me into it, please? I'd like to 
                         see if I can fit into a car designed 
                         for a normal body.

               Both James and Gabrielle enjoy the salesman's discomfort as 
               he helps her into the Mercedes sports car.

               She does her best to make it difficult, deliberately snagging 
               her leg brace clips on the soft leather of the driver's side 
               armrest, forcing him to unhook her and to touch her deformed 
               thighs and knees while manipulating her legs into the 
               footwell.

               EXT. AIRPORT CONVENTION CENTER. PARKING-LOT -- LATE DAY

               James makes love to Gabrielle in the front seat of her small 
               invalid car, deliberately involving the complex hand controls 
               in the mechanics of their sex.

               As he slips his hand around her right breast, he collides 
               with the strange geometry of the car's interior.

               Unexpected controls jut from beneath the steering wheel. A 
               cluster of chromium treadles is fastened to a steel pivot 
               clamped to the steering column. An extension on the floor-
               mounted gear lever rises laterally, giving way to a vertical 
               wing of chromium metal moulded into the reverse of a driver's 
               palm.

               Amid this small forest of machinery, James explores 
               Gabrielle's new and strange body, feeling his way among the 
               braces and straps of her underwear, the unfamiliar planes of 
               her hips and legs, the unique culs-de-sac, odd declensions 
               of skin and musculature.

               Gabrielle lies back. She lifts her left foot so that the leg 
               brace rests against his knee. In the inner surface of her 
               thigh the straps form marked depressions, troughs of reddened 
               skin hollowed out in the forms of buckles and clasps. James 
               unshackles the left leg brace and runs his fingers along the 
               hot, corrugated skin of the deep buckle groove.

               The exposed portions of her body are joined together by the 
               loosened braces and straps. Through the fading afternoon 
               light the airplanes move across their heads along the east -- 
               west runways of the airport. Gabrielle's hand moves across 
               his chest, opening his shirt, her fingers finding the small 
               scars below his collarbone, the imprint of the instrument 
               binnacle of his own crashed car. She runs the tip of her 
               tongue into each of the wound-scars on his chest and abdomen.

               James exposes her breasts, feeling for the wound areas which 
               surround them. As he tries to enter her, she puts her hand 
               over his mouth.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Don't. Not there.

               She spreads her left leg and exposes a deep, trench-like 
               wound-scar in her inner thigh. She directs his hand to this 
               neo-sex organ.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Do it there. And then after that, do 
                         it here.

               Gabrielle rotates over him so that he can see the wounds of 
               her right hip. James turns her back, pulls her thigh in 
               between his own thighs and enters her scar. With his mouth 
               fastened on the scar beneath her left breast, his tongue 
               exploring its sickle-shaped trough, he comes almost 
               immediately.

               INT. FILM STUDIO -- NIGHT

               We float through the studio past a one-story-high automobile 
               battery. Its six cells are transparent and each one contains 
               something submerged in the bubbly water that represents 
               battery acid: a two-man submarine, a scuba diver, a small 
               shark...

               James stands pacing as the dolly shot is reset, lighting is 
               adjusted. An AD brings him a cellular phone.

                                     AD
                         Somebody named Vaughan. Do you want 
                         it?

               James nods. The AD presses the TALK button and hands the 
               phone to James.

                                     JAMES
                         Hello? Ballard.

               INT. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT

               We are close on Vaughan's scarred mouth.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         I need to see you, Ballard. I need 
                         to talk to you about the project.

                                     JAMES
                              (phone)
                         Where are you?

               EXT. MALL. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT

               James drives up to the tattoo parlor, which is located in a 
               small mall. It is next to a small, private medical clinic, 
               and has the same antiseptic, untextured look of the ear, 
               nose and throat suite next door.

               INT. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT

               James enters to discover Vaughan getting a wound tattoo on 
               his abdomen, one that looks as though it could have been 
               made by the fluted lower edge of a plastic steering wheel. 
               The woman giving Vaughan the tattoo is sexless and 
               professional. She could be a nurse or a hospital dietician.

               James sits next to them, barely acknowledged by the woman. 
               Vaughan has messy papers spread out in front of him that 
               include stylized sketches of famous crash wounds, photos of 
               Andy Warhol's scars, automotive styling-detail drawings from 
               a 50s Detroit design studio.

                                     VAUGHAN
                              (to tattooist)
                         You're making it too clean.

                                     TATTOOIST
                         Medical tattoos are supposed to be 
                         clean.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         This isn't a medical tattoo. This is 
                         a prophetic tattoo. Prophesy is dirty 
                         and ragged. Make it dirty and ragged.

                                     TATTOOIST
                              (a hint of sarcasm)
                         Prophetic? Is this personal prophesy 
                         or global prophesy?

                                     VAUGHAN
                         There's no difference. James -- I 
                         want you to let her give you this 
                         one.

               Vaughan spreads out a stained scrap of paper as though it 
               were a sacred piece of parchment. On it is a fiercely sketched 
               wound that looks as though it were made by the Lincoln's 
               hood ornament.

                                     JAMES
                         Where do you think that one should 
                         go?

               Vaughan spreads his legs in a mechanical, unsexual way and 
               grabs the right inner thigh of his greasy jeans.

                                     VAUGHAN
                         It should go here.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               We are close on the fresh tattoo on James's inner thigh. It 
               looks more like a cartoon version of a wound than a real 
               wound. We can see it because James's trousers are down around 
               his knees.

               Vaughan's face comes into frame. He gently kisses the tattoo. 
               James lifts Vaughan's face to his own and kisses his mouth, 
               touches his tongue to each of the scars around Vaughan's 
               mouth.

               EXT. UNDERPASS NEAR AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT

               We see that the Lincoln sits in the shadow of an underpass 
               at the edge of an abandoned auto-wrecker's yard, looking 
               quite comfortable next to the stacks of crushed auto hulks 
               and piles of wheels and bumpers visible through the chain-
               link fence.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               James and Vaughan show their wounds to each other, exposing 
               the scars on their chests and hands to the beckoning injury 
               sites on the interior of the car, to the pointed sills of 
               the chromium ashtrays, to the curtain of wheel covers hanging 
               on a web of twisted wire just outside the car window.

               They touch, embrace, kiss.

               EXT. UNDERPASS NEAR AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT

               James steps unsteadily from the Lincoln into the roadway, 
               followed for an instant by Vaughan's uncertain arm reaching 
               for him.

               He moves away from the car, along the palisade to the 
               overgrown entrance of the wrecker's yard. Above him, the 
               cars on the motorway move like motorized wrecks.

               EXT. AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT

               Just outside the fence of the auto-wrecker's yard, a wreck, 
               its engine and wheels removed, sits on its axles. James opens 
               the door on its rusting hinges. A confetti of fragmented 
               glass covers the front passenger seat.

               James gets in and sits there for a moment, crouched over the 
               mudstreaked instrument panel, his knees tightened against 
               his chest wall. A moment or two of this strangely comforting 
               foetal security, and then James unfolds and begins to get 
               back out of the car.

               An engine starts with a roar. As James steps back into the 
               roadway he is briefly aware of a heavy black vehicle 
               accelerating toward him from the shadow of the overpass where 
               he and Vaughan embraced together. Its white-walled tires 
               tear through the broken beer bottles and cigarette packs in 
               the gutter, mount the narrow curb and hurtle on toward him.

               Knowing that Vaughan will not stop, will kill him, James 
               presses himself against the concrete wall. The Lincoln swerves 
               after him, its right-hand fender striking the rear wheel 
               housing of the car James has just left. It swings away, 
               ripping the open passenger door from its hinges.

               A column of exploding dust and torn newspaper rises into the 
               air as it slides sideways across the access road. The Lincoln 
               remounts the curb on the far side of the road, crushing a 
               ten-yard section of the wooden palisade.

               James can see Vaughan flicking a look back, his hard eyes 
               calculating whether or not he can make a second pass at him. 
               The rear wheels regain their traction on the road surface 
               and the car swings away on to the motorway above.

               James leans against the roof of the abandoned car. The 
               passenger door has been crushed into the front fender, the 
               deformed metal welded together by the impact.

               James retches suddenly and emptily.

               Shreds of torn paper eddy through the air around him, pasting 
               themselves at various points against the crushed door panel 
               and radiator hood.

               EXT. BALLARD APT. BALCONY -- DAY

               James sits on the balcony of his apartment, watching the 
               sky. A single-engined airplane floats above the motorway, a 
               glass dragonfly carried by the sun. It seems to hang 
               motionless, the propeller rotating slowly like a toy 
               aircraft's. The light pours from its wings in a ceaseless 
               fountain.

               Below it, the traffic moves sluggishly along the crowded 
               concrete lanes, the roofs of the vehicles forming a continuous 
               carapace of polished cellulose.

               Suddenly, Catherine is behind him. She puts her hands on his 
               shoulders and he turns to her as though in a dream, gestures 
               toward the airplane.

                                     JAMES
                         I thought that was you, up there.

                                     CATHERINE
                         My last lesson's next week.
                              (pause)
                         James... my car...

               James can see now that Catherine is frightened. He takes her 
               hand.

                                     JAMES
                         What? Tell me.

               EXT. BALLARD APT. DRIVEWAY -- DAY

               Catherine's car sits in the driveway. The paintwork along 
               the left-hand side has been marked in some minor collision. 
               Catherine and James stand examining the mark soberly, 
               archeologists faced with a problematic hieroglyph.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I wasn't driving. I'd left the car 
                         in the parking-lot at the airport. 
                         Could it have been deliberate?

                                     JAMES
                         One of your suitors?

                                     CATHERINE
                         One of my suitors.

               He kneels down to examine the assault on her car.

               He feels the abrasions on the left-hand door and body panels, 
               explores with his hand the deep trench that runs the full 
               length of the car from the crushed tail-light to the front 
               headlamp. The imprint of the other car's heavy front bumper 
               is clearly marked on the rear wheel guard.

               James rises and takes Catherine's arm. He opens the passenger 
               door for her.

                                     JAMES
                         It's Vaughan. He's courting you. 
                         Let's go find him.

               EXT. DESERTED MOTORWAY -- LATE DAY

               Catherine's car hurtles along a deserted six-lane highway.

               INT. CATHERINE'S CAR -- LATE DAY

               James is driving. He looks across at Catherine. She sits 
               very still, pale, one hand on the window-sill.

                                     JAMES
                         The traffic... where is everyone? 
                         They've all gone away.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I'd like to go back. James...

                                     JAMES
                         Not yet. It's only beginning.

               EXT. FAMILIAR STRETCHES OF ROAD -- LATE DAY INTO NIGHT

               They drive past stretches of road we have seen before: the 
               underpass near the wrecker's yard, several accident sites 
               and filling stations, etc.

               EXT. AIRPORT FILLING STATION -- NIGHT

               One of the filling stations is near the airport. As they 
               cruise by it, they spot Vera Seagrave talking to a girl 
               attendant at the pumps.

               James turns into the forecourt. Vera is dressed in a heavily 
               insulated leather jacket, as though she were about to leave 
               on an Antarctic expedition.

               James calls to her from the car.

                                     JAMES
                         Vera! Vera Seagrave!

               At first she fails to recognize him. Her firm eyes cut across 
               him to Catherine's elegant figure, as if suspicious of her 
               cross-legged posture.

               James gets out of the car and approaches Vera. He points to 
               the suitcases in the rear seat of Vera's car.

                                     JAMES
                         Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm 
                         trying to find Vaughan.

               Vera finishes with the girl and, still staring at Catherine, 
               steps into her car.

                                     VERA
                         The police are after him. An American 
                         serviceman was killed on the Northolt 
                         overpass.

               James puts his hand on the windshield, but she switches on 
               the windshield wipers, almost cutting the knuckle of his 
               wrist.

                                     VERA
                         I was with him in the car at the 
                         time.

               Before James can stop her, she accelerates toward the exit 
               and turns into the fast evening traffic.

               James gets back into Catherine's car.

                                     JAMES
                         I think he'll be waiting for us at 
                         the airport.

                                     CATHERINE
                         James...

               James turns the car into the traffic.

               EXT. AIRPORT ROADWAYS -- NIGHT

               Vaughan is waiting for them at the airport flyover. He makes 
               no attempt to hide himself, pushing his heavy car into the 
               passing traffic stream.

               Apparently uninterested in them, Vaughan lies against his 
               door sill, almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward 
               when the lights change. His left hand drums across the rim 
               of the steering wheel as he swerves the Lincoln to and fro 
               across the road surface.

               His face is fixed in a rigid mask as he cuts in and out of 
               the traffic lanes, surging ahead in the fast lane until he 
               is abreast of them and then sliding back behind them, allowing 
               other cars to cut between them and then taking up a watchful 
               position in the slow lane.

               James can see that Vaughan's car has become even more battered 
               than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a rear 
               window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached from 
               the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging 
               from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touching 
               the ground as Vaughan corners.

               When they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes his 
               move. He pulls up beside them and then cuts viciously across 
               three lanes of traffic to hit them broadside. The nose of 
               the Lincoln just nicks the tail of the light sports car, 
               which spins down the road.

               The Lincoln keeps on going, its vast momentum taking it into 
               the guard rails of the exit ramp, and then over them.

               Catherine and James slam spinning into the tail of a tanker 
               which has all but stopped. The traffic behind them has already 
               been slowing and thus easily avoids hitting the sports car 
               when it comes bouncing to a halt across two traffic lanes.

               Catherine lies back, sprawled in her seat, eyes wide and 
               staring with fright, body rigid, bleeding from a small cut 
               on her cheekbone. James jumps out of the car, then immediately 
               slows with a limp. He continues, working his way doggedly 
               through the motionless cars to the edge of the ramp.

               When he looks over the edge, James sees that Vaughan's Lincoln 
               has plunged into the top of an airline coach which was running 
               on the roadway below. With the Lincoln now inside it, the 
               coach then slewed sideways and crashed into several other 
               vehicles.

               Wreckage, flames and blood are everywhere.

               James's eyes are wide: not with horror, but with excitement.

               EXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT

               Catherine and James stand at the gatehouse of the police 
               pound, collecting the gate key from the mustachioed, sharp-
               eyed young officer there.

               They then walk down the lines of seized and abandoned 
               vehicles. The pound is in darkness, lit only by the street-
               lights reflected in the dented chromium.

               They soon find Vaughan's crashed Lincoln, massive and 
               charismatic even here, even in death. James manages to wrench 
               open the passenger-side rear door enough to allow them both 
               to get inside.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT

               Sitting in the rear seat of the Lincoln, Catherine and James 
               make brief, ritual love, her buttocks held tightly in his 
               hands as she sits across his waist.

               EXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT

               Afterwards, they walk among the cars. The beams of small 
               headlamps cut across their knees. An open car has stopped 
               beside the gatehouse. Two women sit behind the windshield, 
               peering into the darkness.

               A pause, and then the car moves forward, its driver turning 
               the wheel until the headlamps illuminate the remains of the 
               dismembered vehicle in which Vaughan died.

               The woman in the passenger seat steps out and pauses briefly 
               by the gates. It is Helen Remington. When she helps the driver 
               out of the car, James and Catherine see that it is the 
               crippled Gabrielle, her leg shackles clacking as she and 
               Helen begin to walk toward Vaughan's car.

               They stroll haltingly, arms around each other, like strange 
               lovers in a cemetery visiting a favorite mausoleum. At one 
               point, Helen kisses Gabrielle's hand, and it is obvious that 
               they have become lovers.

               James and Catherine circle away from the couple and make 
               their way back to the gatehouse.

               In the depths of the pound, Helen helps Gabrielle into the 
               Lincoln. In the darkness of the back seat, they embrace.

               EXT. POLICE POUND. GATEHOUSE -- NIGHT

               James stands talking to the officer at the gatehouse window, 
               holding Catherine's arm around his waist, pressing her fingers 
               against the muscles of his stomach.

                                     JAMES
                         I'd like to register a claim for the 
                         black 1963 Lincoln, the one that 
                         came in a couple of days ago. Is 
                         there a form I can fill out?

                                     POUND OFFICER
                         There certainly is, but you'll have 
                         to come back between 7:30 and 4:30 
                         to get one. What's your attachment 
                         to that thing?

                                     JAMES
                         A close friend owned it.

                         Well, it's got to be a total write-
                         off. I don't see what you could 
                         possibly do with it.

               EXT. CROWDED RAIN-STREAKED ROADWAY -- SUNSET

               We are close on the huge, battle-scarred grill of Vaughan's 
               Lincoln, now brought back to swaying, bellowing life.

               The restoration of the Lincoln is as Vaughan would have wanted 
               it: just enough to get it running and nothing more, with 
               ugly brown primer slapped on to the replaced panels, and 
               whatever was cracked, scraped and crumpled still cracked, 
               scraped and crumpled -- a mobile accident rolling on badly 
               misaligned wheels.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- SUNSET

               We pull back to see James alone in the car. The road is 
               crowded and manic; James is intense, hard, exhilarated, alert -- 
               a hunter. The car is full of junk, pop cans, styrofoam 
               containers, all suggesting that he has basically been living 
               in the car for some time.

               James is searching for something among the lanes of traffic, 
               threading the immense car in and out of the shifting holes 
               that appear and disappear, driving with a fluid recklessness 
               that is recognizably Vaughan's style.

               Suddenly, James becomes tense, focused: he has spotted what 
               he has been looking for.

               EXT. CROWDED RAIN-STREAKED ROADWAY -- SUNSET

               Through the Lincoln's insect- and oil-smeared windshield we 
               can see the unmistakable shape of Catherine's white sports 
               car, itself winding its way aggressively through the braids 
               of vehicles.

               The Lincoln lurches out on to the narrow emergency lane and 
               takes off after Catherine's car, scraping the low concrete 
               wall as it wallows from side to side, clipping the corner of 
               a truck that has made the lane too narrow.

               INT. CATHERINE'S SPORTS CAR -- SUNSET

               In her mirrors, Catherine spots the Lincoln charging toward 
               her along the emergency lane. Her demeanor is just as 
               predatory as James's, and she does not hesitate to react.

               Catherine cranks the steering wheel to the right and dives 
               across two lanes of startled vehicles to fishtail down a 
               little-used utility access road.

               Behind her, and closing rapidly, the lumbering Lincoln follows 
               suit.

               EXT. UTILITY ROAD -- SUNSET

               Around the decreasing-radius curve of the utility road, the 
               more nimble sports car stretches out the distance between it 
               and the Lincoln, but once the road uncurls, the booming V-8 
               allows the American car to gobble up the ground until it is 
               nose to tail with Catherine's car.

               James begins to bump the tail of the sports car, breaking 
               off the accelerator for a beat to let the white car -- which 
               looks especially fragile and delicate by comparison -- get 
               away a bit, then charging back until it makes contact.

               Now the road ahead curves again, and just as Catherine enters 
               the curve, James gives her a seriously violent jolt. The 
               rear of her car slews off on to the grass verge, almost comes 
               back, then loses traction completely.

               Catherine's car spins backwards off the road, then rolls 
               unceremoniously, almost gently, down a small grade, shedding 
               bits and pieces, until it finally flops to a halt on its 
               side in front of a cement culvert.

               INT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- SUNSET

               Momentum has carried James past the point where Catherine 
               has left the road. James stands on the brakes until the 
               Lincoln shudders to a halt. He jams the shift lever into 
               reverse and backs up, tires squealing and smoking in protest, 
               to where he saw her go over the edge.

               EXT. UTILITY ROAD -- SUNSET

               James jumps out of the car and stands for a beat at the edge 
               of the road on the wet grass, savoring the tableau below 
               him.

               Catherine lies sprawled, half out of the car, her tight black 
               dress hiked up over her hips, one arm across her face as 
               though shielding her eyes from the sight of her ruined, 
               lightly smoking sports car.

               James eagerly makes his way down the wet grass of the hill 
               toward Catherine. As he approaches her, she begins to move, 
               stretching her arms behind her head, as though awakening 
               from a deep sleep. He can now see that her dress is wet, 
               soaked by the dirty water trickling out of the culvert and 
               now dammed up by her torso.

               James kneels close to Catherine.

                                     JAMES
                         Catherine. Are you all right? Are 
                         you hurt?

               Catherine's eyes flutter open. Her mascara is smeared, as 
               though she has been crying, and there is wetness at the 
               corners of her eyes. Her upper lip is bruised and beginning 
               to purple, and there is blood on her forehead and at the 
               corner of her mouth.

                                     CATHERINE
                         James, I... I don't know... I think 
                         I'm all right...

               James slips her panties down her legs, leaving them around 
               her left ankle when they snag on the one high-heeled shoe 
               she still has on. He gently rotates her on to her right hip, 
               undoes his fly, then lies down on the concrete with her, 
               ignoring the light, muddy stream which now begins to soak 
               the thigh of his trousers. Kissing the back of her neck, he 
               enters her from behind.

                                     JAMES
                         Maybe the next one, darling... Maybe 
                         the next one...

               We pull up and away from the couple on the ground until we 
               lose them behind the overturned sports car, then rise and 
               pivot until we are once again watching the frantic lanes of 
               traffic hurtling by obliviously only a few meters away.

                                         THE END
CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE

           Soft music. A classy joint. Below the tables, WE PAN
           well-heeled feet nuzzling. Finally we SETTLE ON: 
                         
                         
           A PAIR OF FEET
                         
           WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These
           feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here.
                         
           PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY 
           (41). A handsome couple. He'd be JFK to her Jackie O... 
           if he gave a shit. Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.:
           white sneakers in fancy French restaurant).
                         
           Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu.
                         
                          CAL
           Well, I'm full. You were right,
           hon. I shouldn't have eaten all
           that bread.
                          (THEN)
           Want to just share a dessert?
                         
           Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.
                         
                          CAL
           You okay, babe? You seem out of
           it.
                         
                          TRACY
           Yeah, I'm just thinking about what
           I want.
                         
                          CAL
           Me too. Okay, let's say it at the
           same time. One. Two. Three...
                          TRACY CAL

           JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9). Jessica's skinny,
           wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt. In five years, she's
           going to make all the boys' heads spin. But not yet.

           getcha!
                         
           She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with 
           delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the
           nearby console. Jessica picks it up:

           It's okay, my fault.
                          (THEN)
           Alright, kiddo, it's getting late,
           let's get you to bed before your
           parents get home. Don't give me
           the puppy eyes, you little maniac.
           Go brush your teeth!
                         
           Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica
           looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately.

           Meanwhile, TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN drink and laugh
           at a table. HANNAH (24) is clearly buzzed.

           Almost twenty-five years of
           marriage, you have nothing to say?
                         
           She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say
           something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward.
                         
           It's silent. Devastating.

           She smiles, knocks and opens the door at the same time.

           Cal is sitting on a plain, faux-modern couch. He's 
           staring into space. A SALESMAN APPROACHES. 
                         
                          SALESMAN 
           Can I help you, sir? 
                         
                          CAL 
           My wife is sleeping with David 
           Jacobowitz. I need a couch.

           Cal's back at the bar, sipping on his drink. He looks 
           absolutely exhausted. He looks across the bar. 
                         
           At his usual table, Jacob is now wooing a NEW WOMAN. 
                         
           Cal shakes his head, amazed at this guy's chutzpah. A 
           GUY grabs the open bar stool next to Cal. Cal reacts. 
                         
                          CAL 
           Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for

                          GUY 
           You've been holding the seat for

           David Jacobowitz so eat me. 
                         
           The guy shrugs, walks away. Cal looks at his watch, puts 
           a napkin on his drink, and stands. 
                         
          17 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 17 
                         
           Cal pees. Jacob steps INTO FRAME in the adjacent urinal. 
           Cal does a friendly "I'm peeing next to you" nod. Then: 
                          CAL 
           Can't help but notice that you're 
           always surrounded by women. 
           Multiple women.

           Cal's a few drinks in now. The door to the bar opens as 
           BERNIE (late 40s) rushes in. An oak tree of a man. He's 
           carrying a SHOPPING BAG. 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           Sorry I'm late, I had to pick 
           something up from Macy's.

           Don't worry about it, here, sit, 
           I've been guarding this stool with 
           my life. 
                         
           Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable. 
                         
                          CAL 
           It's good to see you, man. I've 
           called you a few times. It's been 
           a rough couple of days, obviously. 
           Nothing I could use more than my 
           old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey, 
           we should play racquetball, when's 
           the last time we played 
           racquetball? 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           Claire won't let me be friends 
           with you anymore.

           you and Tracy. I chose you. She

           He pulls a WRAPPED PACKAGE from the bag, hands it to Cal. 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           It's cologne.

           Claire's waiting in the car. 
           Um... there's a gift receipt in 
           there. Sorry. 
                         
           Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, 
           lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. 
                         
           Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender. 
                         
                          CAL 
           Do you have anything with a worm 
           in it? Because I'd like a gallon 
           of that now.

           Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get 
           dumped this whole time. 
                         
           He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad
           navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting,
           untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair.
                         
           Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something 
           to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, 
           gets up and walks away. 
                         
                         
           BACK TO CAL
                         
           As the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now 
           showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender.
                         
                          CAL

           A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob.
                         
           Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob
           makes is practiced, perfectly cool.

           Cal, I'm going to make you an
           offer, it's probably the best
           offer you're ever going to get,
           and you're extremely drunk, so
           it's wildly important that you
           don't answer until I've finished
           and you've taken a few moments to
           process what I'm saying. Do you

           the sorriest man I've ever seen in
           my life -- don't interrupt, Cal,
           it's the truth, and you need to
           hear it. You're sitting there
           with your Supercut haircut,
           getting drunk on watered down
           vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-
           year-old girl, wearing a 41R
           jacket when you should be wearing

           You asked me for advice before, 
           Cal, so I'm going to help you. I 
           don't know why. Maybe I'm just
           bored. Maybe all my friends have
           abandoned me for wives and
           children and labradoodle puppies,
           who cares why? Why doesn't
           matter. The point is, you've got
           a good face, and a good head of
           hair, and I'm bored as hell and
           need a project. So if you want,
           I'm going to help you rediscover
           your manhood. Do you remember
           when it was that you lost it?

           A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes. A 
           long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized 
           U-HAUL is parked in the driveway.

           A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can 
           tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball 
           equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son 
           catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house.

           Cal? 
                         
           Cal looks up. Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats. 
           It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward 
           silence. Neither knows what to say.

           She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells 
           him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops 
           himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and 
           complicated about the reality of it all. 
                         
           Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to 
           lighten things.

           That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a 
           difficult time for you, it's
           important that you find new
           interests, try new things, maybe
           things you'd never have considered
           trying before...
                         
           Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder.
           It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.
                         
                          CAL
           Okay, well... Molly, last chance!? 
                         
           But Molly is still locked on Efron.

           Nope.
                         
           The door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica,
           awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool.
                         
                          ROBBIE
           I don't need a baby-sitter.

           I know, Robbie.
                         
           An awkward beat, then.

           She's sitting at a table with Liz (her friend) and a
           GROUP OF REALLY BORING WHITE PEOPLE in suits. There are
           SMALL GIFTS in front of Hannah.
                         
           Holding her hand is an average guy (33), her boyfriend,
           RICHARD. We PICK UP mid-conversation.

                          WHITE MAN
           No, no, no. Chris Rock is the

           Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah. Hannah stifles a
           LAUGH. Liz stands.
                         
                          LIZ
           Well, Richard: thank you for
           inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye'
           party. The conversation has been
           riveting, like stepping back in 
           time. Before I go, a toast.
                         
           She holds up her glass, toasting.

           Gap.

           What's wrong with the Gap?
                         
                          JACOB
           In Hell, every store is the Gap,
           that's what's wrong with the Gap,
           Cal. It's lowest common
           denominator. Be better than the
           fucking Gap, Cal.

           causes Tiffany to lose interest in

           man, as a husband, and probably as

           it's getting late and I think
           you're interesting. I also think
           you're one of those rare women who

           Wanna know why? Because they're

           this is what I need right now: to 
           read a boring, confusing book
           about a bunch of stupid assholes
           who fell in love, like assholes,
           and then had to die, like

           A lot. Just to clarify. I like 
           you a lot. I had no intention of 
           falling for a married woman. I 
           just wanted someone to go to lunch 
           with who didn't make me want to 
           shoot myself in the face. But we 
           started having lunch, and talking, 
           and suddenly I was an accountant 
           who was popping out of bed in the 
           morning, excited to get to work. 
           That doesn't happen to 
           accountants. Ever. I've checked 
           with other accountants.

           officially, I just... I'd like to

           feel... noticed, I guess? What 
           happened between us that night...

           asking to pre-board the Titanic. 
           Honestly, do you really want any 
           part of this?

           She SIGHS.
                         
                          TRACY
           It's been a rough couple of weeks,
           you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I
           have to get back to work.
                         
           They walk out together.
                         
                          TRACY
           They still make kids read The
           Scarlet Letter, huh?

           You'd really think someone would
           have written something better by
           now.
                         
           Robbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit.
                         
                         
          44 INT. TRACY'S OFFICE - LATER 44
                         
           Robbie wheels around in an office chair as Tracy tries to 
           work behind her desk. He stops, noticing a PHOTO. 
                         
           It's an older picture of CAL AND TRACY. They look happy. 
           Very much in love. Tracy notices.
                         
                          TRACY
           Guess I should take it down, huh?

           She tries to return to her work, but can't. 
                         
                          TRACY
           How is he? I've spoken to him but
           only about bills, or you kids,
           but... how is he, really?
                         
           Robbie hesitates.
                         
                          TRACY
           Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me,
           I'm almost done here.
                         
           She turns back to her work. After a beat:
                         
                          ROBBIE
           He's dressing a lot better. Going
           out a lot.
                         
                          TRACY
           Oh. Well, good. That's... really
           good.
           (then, covering)
           We'll get take-out for dinner
           tonight, okay? Think about what
           you're in the mood for.

           He's sad. He looks better, but...
           sadder, too, I think. You know?
                          
                          TRACY
           Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad,
           too.
                         
                          ROBBIE

           I heard you crying the other night 
           and... I didn't know what to do. 
           I'm thirteen years old and... can

                          TRACY
           It's my fault, what happened with

           Here's the thing, David: in the

           dad. He's better than you, in

           math. And she still loves him.

           Now I know what you're thinking:
           `he's just in 8th grade, what does
           he know about love?' I know a lot
           more than you think, David. Just
           today, I had a meltdown, almost
           gave up on the love of my life.
           My dad's having his meltdown now, 
           but long-term? He won't stop
           fighting for my mom any more than
           I won't stop sending Jessica texts
           that make her uncomfortable. And
           you need to know that.

           Bushes rustle. Once, then twice. It's Cal, sneaking 
           into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the 
           house. All is quiet. He gets to work.

           Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob
           in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.
                         
           Jacob looks at Cal. Cal looks great, more comfortable in
           his new "skin" than when we left him. He's drinking a
           martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry.
                         
           A WAITRESS passes. Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of
           the glass, silently requesting a refill. It's a cool,
           practiced move... and he did it instinctively.

           The Waitress leaves, confused. Kate looks around,
           uncomfortable. She tries small-talk.

           What do college guys hate? Doing 
           laundry. What do they love? 
           Strippers. It's a strip club

           cherry flavors like raspberry or 
           strawberry, anything in the -erry

           real here: no one wants the 
           lemon. No one likes the grape.

           "broke up" with Cal earlier) and CLAIRE, a bubbly little

           I have marked myself with this
           Scarlet J, Jessica! For you.
           Because your name starts with a J.
           It's just tape and construction
           paper but one day I will get a
           permanent tattoo when I'm old
           enough that my parents won't freak
           out on me.

           Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment.

           Before, you were the only woman
           I'd ever been with or wanted to be
           with. And now, even after I've
           been with eleven women, you're

           We've been here before... the same group of BORING PEOPLE
           at the same table. Liz and Hannah CHAT off to the side.
                         
           There's a cake on the table that says "CONGRATS HANNAH!"
                         
           Richard stands on a chair.

           Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!?

           she looks like, anyone remember? 
                         
           POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks
           at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink,
           and walks over to Richard. Is this it?
                         
                          RICHARD
           I'm so proud of you, baby. I had

           Now I did tell you that it'd be a
           special night when you passed the
           bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know
           I never lie...
                         
           More HECKLING from the crowd. Liz desperately orders
           another drink, barely able to take it.

           You don't have a better offer

           Everyone LAUGHS.

           No, that's great. I just...
           (then, privately)
           I'm sorry, I thought... I thought
           you were about to propose.
                         
           The room goes quiet, trying to hear.

           No, I just... it's fine. I'm
           sorry, I just got thrown is all.
                         
           Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't
           realize.
                         
                          HANNAH
           No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
                          
                          RICHARD
           It's definitely a possibility,
           down the road. I think I just
           need a little more time. I'm
           still figuring out how I feel
           about us, you know: long-term.
                         
                          HANNAH
           No, I know...

           Wait -- you're figuring out how
           you feel about us?
           She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now
           watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited.

                          HANNAH
           You know what the best part is: I
           would have said yes! To YOU! And
           I didn't even want you to propose!
           Just now, I swear to God: I was
           hoping you wouldn't propose. And
           I still would have said YES!
           That's how pathetic I am!
                         
           She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT.
           She grabs Richard's cheeks.
                         
                          HANNAH
           I will consider your job offer,
           thank you so much, Richard.
                         
           Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes,
           Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five.

           watch. No Cal.
                         
           Suddenly, he looks very alone at his usual table.
                         
           He shakes it off, stands, and approaches the table of a
           group of nearby WOMEN.

           For the first time, he looks like a deer in the 
           headlights.
                         
           She grabs him. Kisses him. A long, deep, almost angry
           kiss. She pulls back.

           At some point, yes, I was under
           the impression that was your plan.
                         
           She takes a deep breath, admits:
                         
                          HANNAH
           I'm very nervous.
                         
                          JACOB
           I'm getting that.
                         
                          HANNAH
           I know at the bar I seemed
           confident, but I was more just
           soaking wet and cold and trying to
           be dramatic.
                         
           Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.
                         
                          JACOB
           You're adorable.
                         
           Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.
                         
                          HANNAH
           No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated
           sexy! Because I know what happens
           next in the PG-13 version of
           tonight: I get really drunk, and
           I pass out, and you cover me with
           a blanket, and kiss my forehead,
           and nothing happens... but that's
           not why I'm here!
                          (THEN)
           I'm here to bang the hot guy from
           the bar who hit on me.

           I do. We're going to bang. I'm

           exciting and dangerous and Liz can
           blow me!
                         
           Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Okay, okay, this is happening.
                          (THEN)
           Take off your shirt.

           I need to stop thinking. Take off
           your shirt.
                         
           Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it
           off. He's ripped.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Holy crap.
                         
           She pokes a finger at his abs.

           It's like you're photo-shopped.

           Now take off yours.

           She motions casually at his abs.

           ENTERS. He looks to his usual table, in need of a
           friend's company.
                         
           But Jacob isn't there.

           Hannah lies on her back in the dim light. Jacob is on
           top of her, shirtless. They're making out, gently.

                          (TIPSY)
           This pillow is amazing. It forms

                          JACOB
           I'm glad you like it.
                         
           They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Wait, are these those foam pillows
           from Brookstone?
                         
           Off his look...
                         
                          HANNAH
           They are, aren't they!? I always

           You do! The hot guy from the bar
           buys them! Of course!
                         
           She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Sorry, let's proceed.
                         
           Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again.

           That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing

           different for him. He likes her.

                          JACOB
           Do me a favor. Ask me a question

           IGNORE. 
                         
           PULL BACK to reveal DAVID JACOBWITZ, across from her. He 
           looks at Tracy and smiles. She smiles back weakly. 
                         
                         
          74 EXT. WEAVER HOUSE - LATER 74 
                         
           The awkward end of a first date. David walks Tracy to 
           the front door. She's carrying those same flowers. 
                         
           Awkward beat. 
                         
                          DAVID JACOBOWITZ 
           I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I 
           was wondering if -- 
                         
                          TRACY 
           David, stop. Look, I had a nice 
           time, which is a substantial 
           upgrade from the rest of the... 
           times I've been having lately. 
           So, I don't think I'm ready to 
           start dating but my ex clearly is 
           and there's a yogurt shop where 
           they make this eight calorie ice 
           cream that tastes like a laxative, 
           so if you'd like to take me there 
           sometime I guess I wouldn't say 
           no. 
                         
                          DAVID JACOBOWITZ 
           Wow. You know, that's exactly 
           what I was thinking. It's almost 
           uncanny. 
                         
           They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry. 
           Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then... 
                         
           THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there. 
                         
                          JESSICA 
           Hello.

           He EXITS. Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward. 
                         
                         
           INSIDE THE DOOR 
                         
           Robbie sneaks down the stairs. From a kneeling position, 
           he can hear and see everything. 
                         
                          JESSICA 
           So... How was dinner?

           It was just for work.

           It's a pretty dress. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           Oh, thanks. 
                         
           Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly.

           Did you know your kids are the 
           only ones I baby-sit for who 
           always want to stay awake so they 
           can see their dad when he gets 
           home. I mean, they fight with 
           everything they have to keep their 
           eyes open so they can hear what 
           Dad had for dinner, or how he 
           liked the movie. Lot of kids want 
           to stay awake for Mom -- and your 
           kids always want to see you, don't 
           get me wrong -- but not a lot wait 
           up for Dad. Maybe it's because 
           he's good, and he's kind, and he's 
           decent.

           She walks out the door. Tracy looks confused.

           But she's gone. Tracy SIGHS ("what the hell was that") 
           and CLOSES the door.

           what Jessica just said about Cal. 
                         
           She puts the FLOWERS down on the table, and heads into

           Jessica ENTERS in a huff, goes right toward a drawer in 
           her dresser. She pulls out a CAMERA. 
                         
                         
           IN QUICK CUTS

           "Cal Weaver." With a heart. She stares at the envelope

           Just then: HER DOORBELL RINGS.

           She opens the front door. Sitting on her stoop: 
                         
           The same flowers that David Jacobowitz gave Tracy sit out 
           front. She looks at the note. It reads: "Just give me 
           a chance, love David J" but the "David J." has been 
           crossed out and replaced with "Robbie." 
                         
           She shakes her head, takes the flowers, closes the door.

           MUSIC CONTINUES as we spy the Weaver family through their 
           windows: Robbie plays video games in his room. Molly 
           watching her show in hers. Tracy in the kitchen. 
                         
           We MOVE DOWN the house, and OUTSIDE, where we discover: 
                         
           Cal in stealth mode, tending to his backyard. He 
           fertilizes, trims and waters. All under cover of night. 
                         
           TRACY (O.S.) 
           Kids! Ice cream! 
                         
           Cal looks into the living room. Tracy has brought out 
           ice cream: a carton with three spoons. The kids race 
           down the stairs, join her, and start eating. Laughing. 
                         
           We take in the real-time TABLEAU: 
                         
           Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside. Cal: 
           watching them from the outside, looking in. 
                         
           It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful. 
                         
           INSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something. 
           She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS 
           her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious. 
                         
           OUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it.

           Jacob JUMPS on Cal. David jumps on Jacob. Bernie tries
           to pull them apart.
                         
           Jessica finally gets the blindfold off Tracy. The women
           and children watch the battle in horror.

           Cal, Jacob, Bernie, and David Jacobowitz sit side-by-side
           on the miniature golf hole, bloodied but still. 
                         
           REVEAL: TWO POLICE OFFICERS standing in the center of
           the yard. One of them finishes writing in a pad. 
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER #1
           Well, okay. That should about do
           it.
           (to his partner) 
           What do you think? 
                         
           The other cop SHRUGS. The first cop, thinks, then: 
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER #1
           Look, I'm just gonna write
           domestic disturbance reported but
           all clear, okay? `Cause honestly,
           I don't even know what to put down
           here.
                         
                          TRACY
           Thank you, Officer. 
                         
           He nods, walks to the door. Stops there.
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER #1
           Just... simmer down, okay? We all
           have arguments, but if you're
           gonna fight -- just do it inside. 
           Keep it in the family, okay?
                         
           Jacob SNARFS down a laugh. Cal glares at him.
                         
                          CAL
           I'll kill you.
                         
           The cops look at Cal, at each other, SHRUG, and EXIT.

           Awkward silence. Our whole cast is there: disheveled
           and bloodied. The place looks like a hurricane has hit. 
           A miniature golf hole torn to shreds. 
                         
           Bernie turns to Jessica.

           I never got it. I saw people in

           do the things they do, it all just

          103 EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - ONE WEEK LATER 103 
                         
           A small MIDDLE-SCHOOL AMPHITHEATER. About 150 people 
           fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation. 
                         
           Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row. Jessica 
           sits with her family a few rows away. All look nice. 
                         
           MANY ROWS BACK -- 
                         
           Sits Cal, sandwiched between RANDOM SPECTATORS. Cal is 
           now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable. 
                         
           His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices... 
                         
           AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah. He leans 
           forward, are they saving it for him? But just then... 
           Jacob arrives. Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat. 
           Cal looks nauseous.

           Tracy looks away, clearly uncomfortable at the teacher's

           Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same 
           kid we've come to love. There's something different in 
           his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA. 
                         
                          ROBBIE
           (a bit monotone) 
           Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. 
           Welcome, Class of 2011. 
                          (A BEAT) 
           I wasn't really sure what I wanted 
           to talk about today. Mrs. 
           Thompson said it might be good to 
           talk about growing up and getting 
           older and stuff. So I guess I'll 
           talk about that. 
                         
           Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son? 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I grew up a lot this year, I 
           think. I used to think that 
           growing up meant really growing. 
           Like getting taller and bigger. 
           But now I think that growing up 
           just makes you smaller. Your 
           dreams get smaller, and what you 
           want gets smaller... 
           (beat, then) 
           I grew an inch and a half this 
           year, but I feel a lot smaller. 
                         
           Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned. 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I was in love. And I know that 
           makes parents laugh because I'm 
           only thirteen but whatever, I was.

           I believed that there was one true 
           love for everyone, and if you 
           fought for that person, your one 
           true love would always work out. 
           But that's not how it works. It 
           sounded good when I was younger, 
           but... it's just not how it works. 
           There's no such thing as one true

           crowd. Everyone turns to look at him.

           Hi, everyone. 
                         
           Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly 
           really uncomfortable. 
                         
                          CAL 
           May I have a word with my son? 
           It'll just take a second. 
                         
           Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps 
           over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. 
                         
           Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his 
           dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family. 
                         
           Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.

           for reminding me of that. 
                         
           Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses 
           his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone. 
                         
           Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces: 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I still love you, Jessica! I've 
           loved you since the first time you 
           changed my sister's diaper! I've 
           loved you since... 
                         
           The crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie 
           continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back. 
                         
          104 EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - LATER 104 
           The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family. 
           They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob. 
                         
                          CAL 
           Hi, Nanna.

           He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob.

           I already ordered a gun. I'm not 
           kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on 
           a shady internet site, I can show 
           you the receipt. If you hurt her, 
           I am prepared to shoot you in the

           Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices: 
                         
                          CAL 
           Is that a new shirt?

           Hannah took me to the Gap. It's 
           actually not as bad as I thought.

           Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. 
           I got this at Nordstrom's. 
                         
           And like that... order is restored in the universe.

           Strained. I took a summer
           internship up at Stanford, gonna 
           head up there early. Figure it
           can't hurt to get out of his line
           of sight for a while.
                         
                          ROBBIE
           Yeah, probably a good idea.
                          (THEN)
           You were a good baby-sitter,
           Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you
           uncomfortable.
                         
           He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.
                         
                          JESSICA
           Wait: I thought you weren't 
           giving up. 
                         
                          ROBBIE
           I'm not. But I figure: you like 
           my dad, and one day I'll look like
           my dad, so I'll just come for you
           then.
                         
           Jessica smiles.
                         
                          JESSICA
           It's a good plan.
                         
           She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse. 
                         
                          JESSICA
           Until then: a little graduation
           gift. To help get you through
           high school.
                         
           She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of
           envelope she once used for...
                         
           Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses
           him, sweetly, on the cheek.
                         
                          JESSICA
           You take care, Robbie.
                         
           Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps 
           up next to his son.

           TRACY (O.S.) 
           I'm terrified of what's going to

           puberty. 
                         
           Cal turns, Tracy has been watching.

           We might have to lock him up.

           years, so... 
                         
           She LAUGHS, then... quiet.

           Do you think we can ever come back 
           from all this, Cal? 
                         
                          CAL 
           I don't know. I'd like to try 
           though. I know I'd like to try. 
                         
           She nods, thinking. 
                         
                          TRACY 
           Things are just so messed up. And 
           it's been such a strange year. 
           I've been in such a strange place. 
           And we have all these problems, so 
           many problems I've lost count, but 
           at the end of the day, I mean, the 
           only thing I know -- 
                         
           She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply: 
                         
                          TRACY 
           I am just so glad you took me for 
           that ice cream.

           Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and

          FADE IN:
          
          INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY
          
          The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a
          nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.
          
          A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.
          
          Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
          FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes,
          also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.
          
          LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.
          She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
          arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the
          panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty
          pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her
          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.
          
          Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen
          suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the
          bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off
          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.
          
                               LETTY
                     Listen, Beast. What have I told
                     you about linen?
          
          The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that
          SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the
          hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill"
          from the counter and checks the time against her watch.
          
          She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food
          arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the
          middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.
          
                               LETTY
                         (looking at Beast)
                     It's liver saute.
          
          Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.
          
                               LETTY
          
                     Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But
                     you're going to have to eat the
                     liver tomorrow.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          
          INT. BATHROOM - SAME
          
          Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls
          back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair
          spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the
          voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.
          
          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
          
          Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is
          mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat
          good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.
          
          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch
          pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.
          She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to
          turn the handle.
          
          Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody
          nose, runs up to her, bawling.
          
                              CHANDRA
                    Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.
          
          Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Chandra)
                    Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip
                    your head back.
          
          She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off
          balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,
          staining it for all eternity.
          
          Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
          guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.
          
                              LETTY
                    Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch
                    it.
          
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
          
          PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with
          BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also
          present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and
          two other BOARD MEMBERS.
          
          Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her
          foot. Johansen clears his throat.
          
                                                                     3.
          
          
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    Well, I have a full calendar today,
                    and I'm afraid...
          
          The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She
          clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her
          blood-smeared lapel.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry
                    I'm late. It's very nice to meet
                    you.
          
          Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending
          down to shake hands with Johansen and the others.
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    The Superintendent was just getting
                    ready to leave.
          
                              LETTY
                    I do apologize.    A student had a
                    crisis.
          
                              MRS. MONTES
                    A crisis, you say?
          
                              LETTY
                    A bloody nose...
          
          There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase
          and reveals the stain.
          
                              LETTY
                    A bloody nose of epic proportions.
          
          Johansen smiles.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes.     Wow
                    us.
          
          EXT. PLAYGROUND - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
          
          A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra
          sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a
          limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym.
          
          Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor
          her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball
          game.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          
                               LETTY
                    No cherry drops, Jenny.
                        (into the phone)
                    Yes, hi. I'm calling for Paul
                    Lascher.
                        (beat)
                    Could you tell him it's Letty?
                        (beat)
                    He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell
                    him that they went for my math
                    idea. Thanks.
          
          Letty dials again. She sees two boys fighting over the ball
          and moves in to break them up.
          
                               LETTY
                        (to boys)
                    Not so rough, guys.
                        (into phone)
                    Mom? Hi. You'll never guess
                    what...I've got the best news.
                        (beat)
                    No, about work. How about dinner?
          
          Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches
          Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar. She
          blows a series of ANGRY, STACCATO NOTES on her whistle.
          
                               LETTY
                        (to Jenny)
                    You're in trouble, young lady.
                        (into the phone)
                    I know, Mom. But it's the only
                    place I can call from.
                        (beat)
                    Can you tell Ruth about dinner?
                        (beat)
                    Paul's fine, just fine.
          
          The class bell BUZZES.
          
                              LETTY
                    Got to go, Mom.   The monsters call.
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the
          patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. Letty sits sipping
          wine with her mother, MRS. MARTHA MAYER, immaculate in a
          cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          
          Letty's sister RUTH--early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair
          and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant, oozing
          happiness. Letty discretely waves her over.
          
                              RUTH
                    Sorry I'm late.
          
          Letty pours her a glass of wine.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Letty was just getting ready to
                    tell me her good news.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Letty)
                    Tell, tell.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (leaning toward Letty)
                    Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on
                    your blouse?
          
          Letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse.
          
                              LETTY
                    So, I got the district to approve
                    my after-school math program.
          
          Ruth smiles at her, but vacantly.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    How wonderful, darling.
                        (beat)
                    What does that mean for you?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll be running it three days a
                    week, and...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Will you get time off to do that?
          
                              LETTY
                    Not now, but maybe later, if they
                    like the program.
          
          Ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit-eating grin
          plastered across her face.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Ruth)
                    What's up with you?
          
                                                                 6.
          
          
          
                             RUTH
                    Me? Nothing. Tell me more about
                    the job.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (to Ruth)
                    Not a job, a promotion.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, Mom, it's more of a prestige
                    thing.
          
                               RUTH
                    Mmmmmmm.
          
          Letty passes her hand in front of Ruth's eyes.
          
                               LETTY
                    Ruth.   Calling Ruth.
          
                              RUTH
                        (laughing)
                    Sorry.
          
                              LETTY
                    Just go ahead and tell us.
          
                              RUTH
                    There's nothing to tell.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (to Ruth)
                    Are you sure, Dear?
          
                               LETTY
                    Come on.
          
                               RUTH
                    No, really. Tell me about the
                    promotion.
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, my theory is that people can
                    really enjoy math, but they lose
                    interest...
          
          Ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting.
          
                              RUTH
                        (almost screaming)
                    I'm getting married.
          
                                                                   7.
          
          
          
          Mrs. Mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears. Ruth leaps up
          and hugs her mother. Other diners glance toward the table.
          
          One WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with
          her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth. Other DINERS
          follow suit. Ruth grins back and starts to giggle.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    I'm so happy for you.     It's just
                    wonderful.
          
          Mrs. Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    My goodness. A wedding.      My
                    goodness.
          
                               LETTY
                    Wow.   Congratulations.
          
          Ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Letty)
                    Can you believe it?
          
          Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse.
          She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and
          her mother, who peers at it with approval.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Tell us every detail.
          
                              LETTY
                    You've only known Jake a few
                    months.
          
                              RUTH
                    Three and a week.
                        (screaming again)
                    Isn't it great?
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    My goodness. What about an
                    engagement party? We must start
                    planning.
                        (signaling a waiter)
                    Champagne. Girls, we need some
                    champagne.
          
          Off Letty's frozen smile, we
          
                                                      CUT TO:
          
                                                                   8.
          
          
          
          INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. PAUL
          LASCHER, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off
          his expensive suit.
          
          He opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly
          pressed T-shirt. He smooths out another shirt he has
          accidently rumpled in the process.
          
                              PAUL
                    So, another one bites the dust.
          
                               LETTY
                    It's not another one. It's my
                    sister.
                        (beat)
                    Aren't you happy for her?
          
                              PAUL
                    She's only known the guy a few
                    months.
          
          Paul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk.
          
                              PAUL
                    Can I put these here for tonight?
          
                               LETTY
                        (pointing to the closet)
                    In there's better.
                        (beat)
                    It's kind of romantic, don't you
                    think?
          
                              PAUL
                    I really think if you're going to
                    spend your life with someone you
                    want to know them pretty damn well.
          
          Paul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow.
          
                              LETTY
                    Believe me, I know your feelings on
                    the matter.
          
                              PAUL
                    The receptionist said you called
                    earlier about something.
          
          Letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul.
          
                                                        9.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    My math program. The
                    Superintendent said he'd fund it.
          
                              PAUL
                    Good going. I knew you could do
                    it.
          
          Paul kisses Letty on the cheek.
          
                              PAUL
                    It looks like we're both bucking
                    for advancement.
          
                               LETTY
                    Yeah?
          
                              PAUL
                    Huntley told me today that if I
                    come through on the Benton
                    deposition, they may consider me
                    for senior associate.
          
          Letty hugs Paul.
          
                               LETTY
                    Congratulations.    We should
                    celebrate.
          
                              PAUL
                    I was thinking dinner on Friday
                    with James and Meg at the Saint
                    Mark.
          
                              LETTY
                    I mean tonight.
          
          Letty sensually caresses his shoulders.
          
                              LETTY
                    Like right now...
          
                              PAUL
                    Actually, I need to review the
                    deposition questions tonight.
                    Maybe tomorrow?
          
                               LETTY
                    Oh, ok.   Maybe.
          
                                                                    10.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    But I thought if you don't mind,
                    you could listen and see how I come
                    across?
          
                               LETTY
                        (beat)
                    Sure. Of course.
          
          Letty continues coloring her multiplication chart.
          
                               PAUL
                    Letty, please, I need your full
                    attention.
          
          Letty puts the chart down and sits up straighter.
          
                              LETTY
                    Let me have it.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Letty rubs her eyes with fatigue.    Bobby stands next to her
          holding a crumpled paper bag.
          
                              BOBBY
                    My dog ate my turtle, and the shell
                    went crunch. I brought it for show-
                    and-tell.
          
          The children perk up at this news.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm sorry about your turtle Bobby,
                    but you know we only have show-and-
                    tell on Mondays. Today, we're
                    scheduled for grammar.
          
                              BOBBY
                    But my mom says I have to throw it
                    away tonight.
          
          Bobby opens the bag. He reaches in to remove the turtle. The
          children TITTER. Letty's on him in a second.
          
                              LETTY
                    Don't even think about it.
          
          She grabs the bag. From outside, there is a KNOCK.     Letty
          and the students look toward the window.
          
          It's Ruth. She's been crying.   She waves to Letty.    Chandra
          waves back at Ruth.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
          Letty puts up her finger to signal "just a minute" to Ruth.
          She sets the turtle bag on Bobby's desk.
          
                              LETTY
                    Class, why don't you...
          
          Ruth knocks on the glass again. Letty glances at her
          distraught sister and walks quickly toward the door.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to class)
                    You guys pull out your verb sheets
                    and review them.
          
          Letty leaves the room. The class watches through the window
          as Ruth throws her sobbing self into Letty's arms.
          
          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - SAME
          
                              RUTH
                    She says she won't even come if Dad
                    brings Monica.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom won't miss your wedding.
                    She'll come around. I promise she
                    will.
          
          Letty glances through the window at her classroom, where
          Bobby waves the turtle over his head.
          
                              RUTH
                    How?
          
                               LETTY
                    I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.
                        (beat)
                    A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics
                    and they'll be ours.
          
                              RUTH
                    Maybe if we had them both to dinner
                    or something.
          
          Letty looks again at the classroom, where the students are
          lobbing the turtle back and forth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe.
          
                              RUTH
                    You always throw the best dinner
                    parties, Letty.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
          
          Letty's attention snaps back to Ruth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, wait a minute, now I see where
                    you're going.
          
                              RUTH
                    Please, Letty.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom and Dad? At dinner together?
                    Are you crazy?
          
          Ruth starts to sob--big, loud, air-gulping sobs.   Letty pats
          her shoulder.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe, though. Maybe it would
                    work. I could throw you an
                    engagement party maybe.
          
                              RUTH
                    Really?
          
          Principal Gail, trolling the halls, spies Letty with Ruth.
          She dispatches a stern look in Letty's direction.
          
                              LETTY
                        (nodding toward Gail)
                    You know what, Ruthie? I better get
                    back to my class, OK?
          
                              RUTH
                    And the party?
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, it'll be fun.
          
          Ruth grabs Letty in another hug.
          
                              RUTH
                    Thank you so much.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - SAME
          
          Letty strides into the classroom, pulls the turtle away from
          Bobby and drops it in the trash.
          
                              LETTY
                    Who can come up here and give me a
                    sentence with a "to be" verb in it?
          
                                                                     13.
          
          
          
                              ZACH
                    Who was that girl?
          
                              LETTY
                    Come on up, Zach.
          
          Zach approaches the board and begins to write, "I am..."    He
          doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off.
          
                              LETTY
                    Neater, Zach.
          
          Zach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches "am."
          
                              LETTY
                    Zach, you know the line by the "a"
                    has to come straight down or it
                    looks like an "o."
          
          Zach looks back toward his classmates for help.
          
                              LETTY
                    What's wrong, Zach?
          
          Letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." She
          erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect.
                               L
                              LETTY
                    Try again, Zach.    Like that.
          
          Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes.
          He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and,
          above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at
          him.
          
          Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks
          like a pretty good "a."
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't believe it.    You still
                    can't do it.
          
                              ZACH
                    I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?
          
                              LETTY
                    No, it's not OK. You'll never get
                    to college on OK.
          
          Letty's fingers press into Zach's arm. A tear slides
          ominously down his cheek.
          
                                                                   14.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    It has to be good, Zach.   Do you
                    understand me?
          
          Zach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs
          away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby
          SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around,
          unsure, confused.
          
          Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and
          looks at the children again.
          
          She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands.
          Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a
          deep breath and raises her head.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm very, very sorry, Zach.
          
          Zach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She
          grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste.
          
                              LETTY
                    You know what, guys? Wednesday's
                    not a grammar day. It's a collage
                    day. It's a collage ON THE WALL
                    day.
          
          Letty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some
          paste. She motions for the students to join her.
          
          The children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind.
          
                              LETTY
                    And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be
                    in charge of paste.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Letty lies in bed. The alarm clock BLASTS opera. Letty
          fumbles for the switch. She can't turn it off. She yanks
          out the cord.
          L
          Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the
          second clock before it rings. She goes to the KITCHEN and
          snaps off the alarm, then heads down the HALLWAY and shuts
          that alarm off, as well.
          
          Letty hurries back to her BEDROOM and crawls into bed.   Paul,
          toweling his hair dry, walks in.
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    What are you doing?    You're going
                    to be late.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm calling in sick.
          
          Paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead.
          
                              PAUL
                    You don't have a fever.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't feel like going to work
                    today.
          
                              PAUL
                    Won't it be hard for them to get a
                    substitute this late?
          
                              LETTY
                    It'll be OK.
          
                              PAUL
                    But what about that math project?
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK
                    with you or am I committing some
                    horrible crime?
          
                              PAUL
                    Forget I asked.
          
                               LETTY
                    I'm sorry.
                        (beat)
                    I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
          
                              PAUL
                    Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, it's not like that.
          
          Letty starts to cry.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's just I've got those parent
                    conferences, and I'm supposed to
                    set up the math program by next
                    week.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                     16.
                              LETTY(cont'd)
                    And shopping for Ruth's dress and
                    that, that engagement dinner.
          
                              PAUL
                    You can get out of the dinner.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, I can't. I've already
                    convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
          
                              PAUL
                    Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
          
          Paul touches Letty's shoulder. She pulls away from him.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't think so.
          
                              PAUL
                    Of course it will. Remember the
                    big talent show you planned last
                    year? And what about the Christmas
                    benefit when Santa canceled at the
                    last minute? But you still pulled
                    it off.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah.
          
                               PAUL
                    You just need to get more
                    organized. L
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe.
          
                              PAUL
                    Let's make a list of the things you
                    need to do, OK?
          
          Letty nods her head, and Paul grabs a legal pad from his
          briefcase.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT
          
          MR. and MRS. ANDERSON, over-eager parents, sit across the
          desk from Letty, who stares at the legal pad in her lap. As
          the Andersons talk, Letty twists a lock of hair tighter and
          tighter.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    So at home, we've started our own
                    little library for Chandra.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    We thought it would be a good
                    project for her to set up her own
                    card-catalogue.
          
                              LETTY
                    I see.
          
          Letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her
          hair.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    But what I'm wondering is whether
                    we should also be spending more
                    time on her computer skills at
                    home. What do you think?
          
                              LETTY
                    Well...
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    Because we don't want her to get
                    behind her classmates.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    And we trust your opinion.
                    Chandra's always talking about Miss
                    Mayer.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh.
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    Just the other day she came home
                    and told us about you taking care
                    of her bloody nose.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    And she went on and on about the
                    collage. That seems very
                    inventive, Miss Mayer.
          
          Letty stares blankly at the couple.
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    Miss Mayer?
          
                              LETTY
                    What the fuck. It's my job.
          
          Off Mr. Anderson's raised eyebrow, we
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
                                                                   18.
          
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          The room is a mess of scattered papers and the math Twister
          game. Letty sits on the ground crying. She makes a pyramid
          out of the wadded-up tissues that surround her.
          
          
          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY
          
          The upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots
          of signs announcing "Sale Day." Frenzied women pick through
          dresses as "Pachelbel's Canon" plays in the background.
          
          Letty is wedged into a corner, sipping coffee. A CLERK
          approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries.
          
                              CLERK
                    More coffee?
          
                              LETTY
                    Hit me.
          
                              CLERK
                    Danish?
          
                              LETTY
                        (rooting through the tray)
                    No more bear claws left?
          
          Ruth bounces into the shop.
          
                              CLERK
                        (to Ruth)
                    Danish?
          
                              RUTH
                    Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to
                    eat.
          
          The clerk gives Ruth an approving smile as Letty rips into a
          sweet roll. Ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Letty)
                    Where's Mommy?
          
                              LETTY
                    Do you have to call her Mommy?
          
                              RUTH
                    Where's the old bag I sometimes
                    call Mommy?
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    She said she'd be here at 10.
          
          Ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up.
          
                              RUTH
                    What do you think of this one?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'd have to see it on.
          
          Ruth looks closer at Letty.
          
                              RUTH
                    Have you been crying?    Your eyes
                    are all puffy.
          
          Letty self-consciously touches her eyes.
          
                              LETTY
                    Things have been kind of stressful
                    lately.
          
                              RUTH
                    But everything's OK?
          
          Ruth is trying on a veil at this point.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, everything's under control.
          
                              RUTH
                    What about the engagement party?
          
                              LETTY
                    Everything's ready for tomorrow
                    night--except the artillery.
          
                              RUTH
                    Thanks so much for planning it,
                    Letty. Jake's really looking
                    forward to it.
          
          Letty sighs, moves to the racks and pulls out a dress.
          
                              LETTY
                    You better start trying on before
                    the vultures get all the good ones.
          
          INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER
          R
           uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up
          discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up.
          
                                                                  20.
          
          
          
                              RUTH
                    What about this one?
          
                              LETTY
                        (with sisterly pride)
                    You look beautiful.
          
                               RUTH
                    Really?
          
                               LETTY
                    Truly.
          
          Martha Mayer is led in by the clerk.
          
                               LETTY
                    Hi, Mom.
          
                              RUTH
                    Look, Mom, I think I've found the
                    dress.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    You look just wonderful, Ruthie.
                    But I really think you should try
                    on a few more, don't you?
          
          Letty and Ruth shoot each other a look of doom.
          
          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER
          
          A bedraggled Letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at
          dresses. They are bumped and jostled from all sides.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Has Paul heard about his promotion?
          
                              LETTY
                    No, not yet. But you know Paul.
                    He's sure to get it.
          
          Ruth comes out of the dressing room in another gown.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I don't like the bias cut on that
                    one.
          
          Mrs. Mayer holds up an ornate dress.
          
                              RUTH
                    No more. I can't stand to try on
                    one more dress.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Letty, I think this would be
                    beautiful on you.
          
                                LETTY
                    Oh no.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Paul could pop the question at any
                    time.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, please.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Especially with a promotion in the
                    offing.
          
                              RUTH
                    Go on, Letty. I want to see it on
                    you.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Ruth)
                    Do you think I should?
          
                                RUTH
                    Yes, yes.    It'll be fun.
          
          Letty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room.
          
          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER
          
          Letty emerges from the dressing room.
          
                               LETTY
                    Mom?   Mom? Ruth?
          
          Letty peers around the corner, becoming a tad frantic. But
          neither her mother nor Ruth is to be found. It's just Letty,
          resplendent in ecru satin.
          
                              CLERK
                    I think they went over to the next
                    shop to take a peek at shoes.
          
          Letty pushes back her veil, sits down on the floor and takes
          a sip of her now-cold coffee.
          
                                                                     22.
          
          
          
          INT. LETTY'S LIVING/DINING ROOM - EVENING
          
          A "House and Garden" picture of elegance. Letty, Paul, Ruth
          and Jake stand at nervous attention, decked out in their
          Sunday best.
          
          A KNOCK marks the first arrival. Letty opens the door to her
          mother, who does a quick reconnaissance of the room.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I gather he's late as usual.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to her mother)
                    Can I get you a glass of champagne?
          
          The doorbell RINGS. Letty greets her father, a mid 50s
          business type, and his wife MONICA, a younger version of
          Letty's mother.
          
                              LETTY
                    Hi, Dad, Monica.   I'm so glad you
                    could come.
          
          Suddenly, the parents are face-to-face, Letty standing
          between them.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, this is Monica.   Monica, my
                    mother, Martha.
          
          The two Mrs. Mayers make appropriate MURMURS. Letty's
          parents stare each other down. Ruth shifts from foot to foot.
          Silence falls in the room with a thump.
          
                              LETTY
                    Dad, Mother, you've met before,
                    right?
          
          Ruth takes a dramatic gulp of air. The evening hangs in the
          balance. Finally,
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    How've you been, Martha?
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Mr. Mayer and Monica cozy up to each other on the love seat
          while Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Paul sit on the opposite couch.
          
          Letty passes hors d'oeuvres, and Jake doles out napkins.
          
                                                                 23.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    It's mushroom-time, folks.
          
                              MR. MAYER
                        (biting into one)
                    I like the touch of cilantro. It is
                    cilantro, isn't it?
          
                              LETTY
                    You can always call it, Dad.
                              M
                               ONICA
                    You must get your cooking skills
                    from your father, Letty.
          
          Uncomfortable silence falls on the party. Monica wipes the
          edge of Mr. Mayer's mouth with her napkin.
          
                              LETTY
                    Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down
                    to two, Dad.
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    Tell me about them.
          
                              RUTH
                    One's a silk...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Not in front of Jake, Ruthie.    It's
                    bad luck.
          
          Ruth looks at Letty nervously.
          
                              MONICA
                    I remember how hard it was looking
                    for my dress. I must have been to
                    100 stores.
          
          Mrs. Mayer clears her throat.    More silence.
          
                               LETTY
                    You know what I think we need?
                    Martinis. How about martinis to
                    celebrate?
          
                              PAUL
                    Yes.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    That might be nice.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    As long as you have...
          
                               LETTY
                    Puglia olives. Would I forget?
                        (beat)
                    A round of martinis coming right
                    up.
          
          Letty leaves with Paul hot on her heels.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Letty shakes the martinis while Paul gets out the glasses.
          Ruth enters the kitchen and sidles up to Letty.
          
                              RUTH
                    How can I help?
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul, can you hand me the olives?
                    Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
          
                              RUTH
                    What about the souffle?    Has that
                    gone in?
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, I just put it in. But the
                    squab, I think that needs to be
                    basted.
          
          Paul hands Letty the olive bottle.
          
                              PAUL
                        (to Ruth)
                    Kind of icy in there.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Paul)
                    Thank God we have alcohol.
          
          Letty skewers olives and puts them in the martinis. Bits of
          fleck rise from the olives, then swim to the tops of the
          glasses.
          
                                LETTY
                    Fuck me.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's the matter?
          
          Letty grabs the olive bottle.
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          
                               PAUL
                    Letty?
          
          Letty stands still, fixated on the olive bottle.
          
                               PAUL
                    Let?       L
                              LETTY
                    Olives Aux Herbes De Provence.    I
                    got the wrong kind of olives.
          
          Ruth holds up a glass.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's all the dreck?
          
                              LETTY
                    Sage, rosemary...
                        (in a sarcastic French
                         accent)
                    Les Herbes.
          
                              RUTH
                    It'll be fine.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, no. They've got to be Puglia
                    olives, packed in a light brine
                    with a flavor that doesn't
                    overpower the palate.
          
          Jake enters.   The three turn on him.
          
                              LETTY/PAUL/RUTH
                    You can't leave them alone./Get
                    back in there./Are you nuts?
          
          Jake whirls around and exits.
          
          Letty looks for olives, banging open the cupboards one after
          the other. Quicker and quicker. More and more frantic.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
          
          Jake, Mr. Mayer, Monica and Mrs. Mayer stare at each other,
          listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the
          kitchen.
          
                              JAKE
                    What do you think of those Lakers?
          
                                                                     26.
          
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Letty paws through her purse.
          
                              PAUL
                    What are you doing?
          
                              LETTY
                        (wild-eyed)
                    Can you loan me a 20?
          
                                 PAUL
                    Sure. Why?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm going to the store.
          
                              PAUL
                    I think you're overreacting.
          
          Letty turns her best school marm look on Paul. He hands over
          a crisp bill.
          
                               RUTH
                    Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The
                    souffle...
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll be back before you can say
                    souffle.
          
          Letty leaves from the kitchen's back door. Ruth heads to the
          living room. Paul leans wearily against the counter,
          savoring one of the herb-filled martinis.
          
          INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
          
          Fluorescent lights beat down on Letty. She races through the
          aisles. She clutches her keys in one hand, a $20 bill in the
          other. Letty careens around a corner. At the last second,
          she avoids smacking into another shopper. She stops.
          L
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Shelf after shelf of olives...black olives...all black.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty darts up and down the aisle, searching, searching.
          Nothing.
          
                                                                       27.
          
          
          
          Letty scurries to the front of the store. She taps a STORE
          CLERK on the shoulder. Six people waiting in line mutter,
          annoyed.
          
                              LETTY
                    I can't find martini olives.     All
                    you have are black.
          
                              STORE CLERK
                        (without looking up)
                    Aisle 2A.
          
          Letty whips down an aisle.    She starts to sweat.
          
          An OLD LADY blocks her path.
          
                              OLD LADY
                    Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the
                    cat food.
          
          Letty pauses.    She reaches up and hands the woman a can of
          food.
          
                              OLD LADY
                    And a turkey and giblets, too,
                    please. She does like her turkey.
          
          Letty grabs another can, throws it in the Old Lady's cart and
          darts away while the Old Lady continues to talk.
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          The sign for Aisle 2A.    Olives.   Lots of them.   Green.   All
          shapes. All sizes.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty's shoulders relax.    She scans the shelf.
          
          LETTY's POV:
          
          Labels of olives: big, small, with pimentos, without.        None
          from Puglia, Italy.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty zooms back to the front of the store.      To the clerk.
          
                              LETTY
                    They're not there. I need the ones
                    from Puglia.
          
                                                                     28.
          
          
          
          She gets no response from the clerk, who counts change for a
          customer. Letty gestures wildly with her hands.
          
                              LETTY
                    They're the ones that are packed in
                    brine, but they don't overpower
                    the, you know, the palate.
          
                              STORE CLERK
                        (without looking up)
                    Specialty foods. 7B.
          
          Letty's off again. To the land of pink peppercorns,
          dehydrated mushrooms and Chinese 5-Spice. But no olives.
          Not a single bottle.
          L
          Letty paws through the shelves, knocking things over as she
          scours the aisle. She is oblivious to the mess that
          surrounds her.
          
          An EMPLOYEE with a price checker walks half-way down the
          aisle. He spots Letty and rushes away.
          
                              LETTY
                    Where are they?   Where are they?
          
          More and more items crash to the ground.   Letty is beyond
          frenzied.
          
                              EMPLOYEE (OS FILTERED)
                    Manager to 7B. Manager please.
          
                              LETTY
                    Where are they?
          
          Letty pounds her fist against the shelf. More goods fall.
          Shoppers stare. The Manager rushes toward Letty.
          
                              MANAGER
                    What's wrong, Miss?
          
                              LETTY
                    Tell me where they are.
          
          She gestures. She knocks over a bottle of fat-free
          Lingonberry preserves. It crashes to the floor, spewing jam.
          
                              MANAGER
                    I think you should go now.
          
                              LETTY
                    I need my olives.
          
                                                                     29.
          
          
          
                              MANAGER
                    It's time to leave.
          
          The Manager places his hand on the small of Letty's back as
          if to guide her out of the store. Letty backs away. The
          manager grabs hold of her wrist.
          
          Letty whacks him in the shoulder with her free hand. She
          pushes him away. Hard. He staggers against the opposite
          shelf.
          
          Customers and employees gather at both ends of the aisle,
          riveted by the spectacle.
          
                              MANAGER
                    Call security. Where's security,
                    please?
          
          Letty takes her arm and slides a shelf-full of products onto
          the floor. They crash and break. She screams.
          
                              LETTY
                    Fucking olives. Fucking, fucking
                    olives.
          
          Two SECURITY GUARDS turn the corner.   Letty spots them.   One
          creeps closer.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, no, no. Go away.
          
          Guard One continues to approach, cooing encouragingly. Letty
          throws a jar at him. It clips him in the head. He turns
          away, bleeding. Guard Two pulls out a billy club.
          
                              MANAGER
                        (yelling)
                    Call police. Now.
          
          Letty stops. Dazed. She turns around. Guard Two walks toward
          her. His stance suggests he's stalking a wild animal.
          
          Letty tries to brush off the jam that dribbles down her
          skirt. She looks to both ends of the aisle.
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Faces, dozens and dozens of faces, stare down at her.   People
          point. One boy LAUGHS.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          
          Letty backs against the shelf. She slides down it until she
          is sitting on the floor. She buries her head in her knees,
          sobbing.
          
                                                           FADE OUT:
          
          FADE IN:
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          The room is furnished like a Hyatt Hotel minus anything you
          might use to kill yourself. Letty sleeps.
          
          MICHAEL, mid 30's, in jeans and T-shirt, sits in a chair next
          to the bed. He looks intently at Letty, checks his watch and
          taps her on the shoulder. She stirs.
          
                               MICHAEL
                     Miss Mayer? Miss Mayer?
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Everything's a morning blur. Gradually, items come into
          focus -- the intercom for the nurse, the door with a window
          in it, the three tissue boxes on the bedside table. It's a
          hospital, all right. Letty's vision is filled suddenly by
          Michael's concerned face peering into hers.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
                               MICHAEL
                     I know you've had a rough night,
                     but I have a few questions for you,
                     Miss Mayer, or Letitia.
          
          Letty pulls herself up to a sitting position.
          
                               MICHAEL
                     Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
          
                               LETTY
                     Letty.
          
                               MICHAEL
                         (consulting his notes)
                     First off, Letty, can you tell me
                     where you are?
          
                               LETTY
                     I answered these questions last
                     night.
          
                                                          31.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I know this can be a real drag, but
                    the attending physician on day
                    shift is required to do his own
                    prelim exam when a patient is
                    admitted during the night.
          
                              LETTY
                    Hillview Psychiatric Hospital.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to
                    remember three items. I'm going to
                    ask you to repeat them in just a
                    few minutes. They are chair, cup
                    and ball. Did you get that?
          
          Letty nods.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    OK, let's subtract 6 from a
                    succession of numbers starting with
                    91.
          
                              LETTY
                    85.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    And 85 minus 6?
          
                              LETTY
                    59.
          
          Michael waits.
          
                             LETTY
                    No, 79. Sorry, this makes me
                    nervous.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind
                    of thing.
          L
          Letty smiles uncomfortably.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Now the three things I asked you to
                    remember.
          
                              LETTY
                    Chair, cup and ball.
          
                                                          32.
          
          
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Terrific.
          
          Letty smiles, a real smile this time.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Let me shift gears here a minute...
                        (beat)
                    Do you ever hear voices that other
                    people don't hear or see things
                    they don't?
          
                                LETTY
                    No.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What about patterns? Do you find
                    yourself checking and re-checking
                    locks? Or washing your hands over
                    and over again?
          
          Letty shakes her head "no."
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How about arranging your
                    possessions in a certain way?
          
          Letty pauses.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Yes?   Go right ahead.
          
                              LETTY
                    Sometimes my food, and my clothes,
                    and my underwear.
          
          Michael leans closer.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How do you sort it--by lace and
                    cotton?
          
                                LETTY
                    By color.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What if it's got a pattern?
          
                              LETTY
                    Is this really important? Because
                    I don't think it's a problem.
          
                                                                   33.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I see.
                        (looking at his notes)
                    How long has it been since you've
                    done something you've enjoyed,
                    Letty?
          
                               LETTY
                        (beat)
                    A while, I guess.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That must be really difficult.
          
          Letty tears up.   Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey, it'll be OK.   We'll make sure
                    of that.
          
          Letty gives him an appreciative look.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    For now, why don't you just take it
                    easy while I confer with my
                    colleagues. A nurse should be in
                    shortly.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - LATER
          
          Letty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed. She
          writes in her organizer. DR. ROBERT EMLEE, early 40s and in
          jeans, enters with his own organizer.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and
                    I have some questions to ask you...
          
                              LETTY
                    I did this already.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    It's hospital policy...
          
                              LETTY
                    To be interviewed every hour?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I'm the only doctor making rounds
                    this morning.
          
                                                          34.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, I don't have hallucinations.
                    Honest.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    This doctor, was he tall, with dark
                    hair?
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, and a dimple.
          
          Dr. Emlee shifts uncomfortably.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
          
                              LETTY
                    Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    Patient.
          
                               LETTY
                    What?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Michael, the man who came to see
                    you, is a patient.
          
                              LETTY
                    What kind of place is this?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I apologize for the inconvenience,
                    but I must ask you some...
          
                              LETTY
                    I want to see my mother
                    immediately.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    We discourage family visits for the
                    first 48 hours after an emotional
                    trauma like the kind you've
                    experienced.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't think you understand.    I
                    won't wait.
          
                                                                    35.
          
          
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    You'll have to. Your family agreed
                    to the conditions not to see you
                    when they admitted you to Hillview,
                    Letitia.
                        (beat)
                    We can talk about how that makes
                    you feel, but we can't change the
                    rules.
          
          Letty sinks back on her pillows, the wind knocked out of her.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Dr. Stone's evaluation from last
                    night indicates you're experiencing
                    a great deal of anxiety, probably
                    related to depression...
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Dr. Emlee continues to talk. His words become more and more
          distant as the RINGING in Letty's head grows louder.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    We need to talk about starting you
                    on drug therapy. Most depressive
                    personalities benefit from a drug
                    like Prozac or maybe Zoloft...
          
          CUT TO:
          
          INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          It's a bigger version of a waiting room you'd find in a
          doctor's office. And it has more games.
          
          Some patients watch television. Others play pool. Several
          form a group around Michael, who holds the same notebook he
          used in his session with Letty. JOHN, unkempt in a bathrobe,
          hands him a few ratty dollar bills.
          
                              JOHN
                    I'm in for 5 for manic depressive.
          
          THOMAS, late 40s and in a suit, waves a $5 bill at Michael.
          
                              THOMAS
                    I'll go with that as well.
          
          Michael takes the money, and turns to MARIE, late 30s.
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
          
                               MARIE
                        (to John and Thomas)
                    You two always bet manic
                    depressive.
                        (
                          to Michael)
                    Tell me more about the guard she
                    strangled.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No, just hit in the head.
          
                              JOHN
                    What about voices?    Does she hear
                    voices?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Not that she admits to.
          
                              MARIE
                    Is she a washer?
          
                               MICHAEL
                    No, but she is exceptionally
                    organized.
          
                              THOMAS
                    How organized?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    She arranges her underwear by
                    color.
          
          Michael motions to MRS. HALLSTROM, mid 50s, who shuffles by.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you want in?
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    All tapped out.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll float you.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom keeps walking.
          
                              MARIE
                        (to Michael)
                    It's been weeks since she played.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What about you, Marie?
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
          
                               MARIE
                        (handing Michael a $20
                         bill)
                    I'll say major depression
                    complicated by obsessive compulsive
                    disorder.
                        (beat)
                    And could I get my change in ones?
          
          INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty lags behind NURSE GATES, early 30s and in civilian
          clothes, as they walk down the hall.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Treatment schedules are posted on
                    the bulletin board. Dinner at 6,
                    lights out at 10 and no
                    fraternizing between patients.
          
          Letty nods.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (pointing as she goes)
                    That's the rec room. We show
                    movies there on Wednesdays and
                    Fridays...And this is the dining
                    hall.
          
          Letty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room, an
          upscale version of a college cafeteria. Groups of people eat
          and talk. A paper airplane sails from one table to another.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm really not that hungry.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Just eat whatever you want. This
                    will give you a chance to meet some
                    people.
          
                              LETTY
                    You know, my mom's coming to get me
                    tomorrow. I'll be leaving.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here
                    with you.
          
          INT. DINING HALL - SAME
          
          Nurse Gates guides Letty to a table where John, Mrs.
          Hallstrom, Marie and Thomas sit.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
                              THOMAS
                    So I said to my publisher this
                    afternoon, I said, don't you even--
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (interrupts)
                    Hi, gang. I want to introduce you
                    to Letty.
                        (to Letty)
                    Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and
                    Marie, and John and Thomas.
          
                              THOMAS
                        (to Letty)
                    Just discussing my pesky publisher.
                    May I ask what you do when you're
                    not vacationing?
          
                              MARIE
                        (to Thomas)
                    Let the poor girl get some food,
                    for Heaven's sake.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm a teacher.
          
                              THOMAS
                    As you may have gathered, I'm a
                    writer.
          
          John snorts. Thomas ignores him.   Mrs. Hallstrom stares down
          at her plate.
          
                              THOMAS
                    I don't like to say novelist. That
                    sounds a little grandiose, but I am
                    on my third novel and...
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas,
                    but we really should get some
                    food...
          
          Nurse Gates leads Letty to a table, and hands her a plate.
          Letty looks up to see Michael at the other end of the table,
          doing a card trick for two OTHER PATIENTS.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to patients)
                    Now I'm going to say that the card
                    you picked was the Ace of Spades.
          
                                                                       39.
          
          
          
          He flips the top card up and it's the Ace of Spades.       The
          patients chortle.
          
                                 NURSE GATES
                    Michael.
          
          Michael turns toward the nurse.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Michael, this is Letty.      She just
                    arrived yesterday.
          
          Letty stares at Michael coldly.
          
                               LETTY
                    We've met.
                        (to Michael)
                    I missed you during rounds this
                    morning.
          
          Letty turns and leaves, carrying her empty plate with her.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (to Michael)
                    This doctor thing has got to stop.
          
          Nurses Gates hurries after Letty.
          
          EXT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty stands outside the waiting room door.       She tucks her
          blouse into her jeans and enters.
          
          INT. WAITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty's mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that
          looks much like the library of an English country manor. She
          springs up as soon as she spots Letty. They rush to each
          other. Letty's mother strokes her hair.
                               M
                               RS. MAYER
                    I'm here, Sweetheart.      I'm here.
                    It's going to be OK.
          
                                 LETTY
                    I'm sorry.     I'm so sorry.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Oh, Letty, what happened?
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, I was there, and I just, I was
                    so...
                              (MORE)
          
                                                          40.
                              LETTY(cont'd)
                    They didn't have the olives, and I,
                    I got so upset. I don't know how it
                    happened.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he
                    says...
          
                               LETTY
                    I'm so glad to see you. You can't
                    believe the people in here.
                    They've got patients posing as
                    doctors...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Everyone says it's the best
                    facility in the area for this sort
                    of thing.
          
                              LETTY
                    I just want to go home.   Can we go
                    home now?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I think the best thing for you
                    right now is to stay here and get
                    well.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe I should talk about this with
                    Ruth, or Paul.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    We all agree with the doctor, Dear.
                    He thinks it's safer for you to
                    stay here for a while.
          
          Letty listens, waits, can't absorb it.
          
                              LETTY
                    You all really think I need to be
                    here?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Yes.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Ruth's already taken him home.
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    And my class. It'll be hard to
                    find a good substitute. And what
                    about my math program?
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    Paul said he'd call the school.
                        (beat)
                    And your father thinks he's
                    convinced the guard not to press
                    charges as long as you get help.
          
                                LETTY
                    Charges?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    For his injuries. I guess you...I
                    guess he got hit in the head.
          
          Mrs. Mayer holds out a duffel bag to Letty.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I packed up some of your clothes,
                    and I can bring whatever else you
                    need.
          
          Letty refuses to accept the duffel bag. Her mother sets it
          on the floor and stands. Letty is five again.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, no, please don't go.    Please.
          
          Letty's mother holds her. Mrs. Mayer, crying, pulls away
          from Letty. She kisses her daughter on the cheek.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I'll see you soon.
          
                                LETTY
                    Tomorrow?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
          
          Letty's mother walks out the door.    Letty stares after her.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Letty, crying, unpacks her duffel bag, laboriously smoothing
          and refolding every item she puts in the drawer.
          
          Finishing her task, Letty goes to the mirror and stares at
          her reflection. Finally, she fixes her makeup.
          
                                                                    42.
          
          
          
          Letty leaves her room. We follow her FOOTSTEPS down the
          hallway. In the distance, Letty sees the Rec Room. She
          hears the CLAMOR of voices. Every step is agony.
          
          Letty stops herself just before entering, trying to collect
          herself.
          
                              MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Four people bet OCD and clinical
                    depression so I split the pool.
          
                              JOHN (O.S.)
                    Yeah, her diagnosis was no mystery.
          
                              MARIE
                    Especially the OCD.
          
          Sick realization spreads over Letty's face.
          
                              JOHN (O.S.)
                    Fuck, I mean, anyone who color-
                    codes her panties has big problems.
          
          Letty freezes. Michael rounds the corner. He stops when he
          sees her, falters, recovers his composure.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey there. They're showing
                    "Groundhog Day" if you...
          
                              LETTY
                    You took bets on my diagnosis?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's no big deal.   We all compare.
          
                              LETTY
                        (voice rising)
                    W
                     ho do you think you are?
          
          INT. REC ROOM - SAME
          
          Patients are grouped in front of the TV, watching Bill
          Murray. Heads turn as they hear shouting in the hallway.
          Not even a moment's hesitation before, one by one, they get
          up and hurry to the hall. Only Mrs. Hallstrom remains.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - SAME
          
          John, Marie and others gather around the fighters.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Don't take it personally.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    You have no right, no right to take
                    the worst thing that's ever
                    happened to me and make it into
                    some kind of game.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Stop acting like you're someone
                    special. You're just like the rest
                    of us.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm not the one who's masquerading
                    as a doctor. I'm not the one
                    who's, who's...
          
                              JOHN
                        (to Letty)
                    He's schizophrenic.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm not the one who's
                    schizophrenic. I don't see people
                    who aren't there or run around
                    acting crazy.
          
          Letty pounds her fist against the wall.
          
                              PATIENTS
                    Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oh, no, you're perfectly sane.
                    That's why you're here.
          
          Letty looks like she's been slapped. She thinks for a
          moment. The patients wait, breathless, for her retort.
          
                              LETTY
                    Go fuck yourself.
          
          Michael grins at Letty. She turns, and strides down the
          hall. There's a smattering of applause. It grows stronger.
          
          We see Letty's eyes fill with tears as, behind her, the
          patients yell.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Letty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns. She gets out of
          bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself
          together. She slumps to the floor and starts to cry.
          
          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          D
           r. Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding
          chairs. Michael, who sits next to Emlee, practices rolling a
          quarter back and forth across his fingers.
          
          Letty sits across from Michael and Emlee, her legs and arms
          crossed tightly. The group concentrates on Mrs. Hallstrom.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    I can't stop thinking about the
                    things I did wrong when my daughter
                    was little.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    And how's that make you feel?
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    I just feel like sleeping.    All the
                    time.
          
                              THOMAS
                    Hell's bells, you can count me in
                    on that. I haven't had enough Z's
                    since I ran those sleep disorder
                    experiments at Stanford back in the
                    70s.
          
                              MARIE
                    We really miss doing things with
                    you, Mrs. Hallstrom.
          
          Michael, sitting next to Mrs. Hallstrom, squeezes her arm.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Maybe when I hit my manic phase
                    again.
          
          Group members smile.
          
                              JOHN
                    I've noticed Letty doesn't much
                    like to do things with us.
          
          The group looks expectantly at Letty.
          
                                                                   45.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, no. Of course I do.
          
                              JOHN
                    Then why are you so defensive?
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to John)
                    I don't think we need to sacrifice
                    Letty to pep up a slow session.
          
                              JOHN
                        (to Michael)
                    You're the one who told everyone
                    about her panties.
          
          Michael grimaces at John.   Letty's head is bent down.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Maybe you'd like to share some of
                    your feelings about OCD or
                    depression with us, Letty.
          
          Letty eyes the doctor.   She's dangerously close to tears.
          
                              LETTY
                    Do we have to talk about this?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I think in the spirit of group
                    therapy, it's beneficial for each
                    of us to open ourselves up to the
                    others.
          
          Michael reaches his hand behind Dr. Emlee's head, catching
          Letty's eye in the process. Michael pulls a silver dollar out
          of Emlee's ear.
          
          Letty looks but doesn't respond. The other patients ignore
          Michael. Emlee is oblivious.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    You never know, Letty, how the
                    person sitting next to you may be
                    able to shed light on one of your
                    problems...
          
          Michael goes for a bigger trick. Reaching again behind the
          doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers.
          Letty, almost against her will, smiles.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    ...by revealing something that's
                    going on in his or her own life.
          
          Michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's
          head. Letty's smile broadens.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                        (responding to her smile)
                    There, now, I knew you'd feel
                    better once we discussed group
                    process. Let's talk a little about
                    your OCD.

          Letty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks. Michael turns the
          corner, thumbing through a dog-eared book. Letty spots him
          and moves away. Michael sidles up next to her.

                               ICHAEL
                    Looking for a romance?
          
                                 LETTY
                    Excuse me?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What are you looking to read?
          
                              LETTY
                    Anything interesting.
          
          Michael holds out his book to her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    This is good.
          
          Letty glances at the title, "101 MAGIC TRICKS."
          
                              LETTY
                    But you're checking it out.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I've already checked it out 17
                    times.
          
          Michael reaches behind Letty. She pulls away. He produces a
          scarf from behind her back, and presents it to her. She
          doesn't take it.
          
                              LETTY
                    You keep the book.   I'm looking for
                    Emily Dickinson.
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
          
          Letty walks away.   Michael follows.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey, if you take the magic book,
                    I'll feel like maybe you accept my
                    apology and don't hate me anymore.
          
          Letty hesitates.
          
                              LETTY
                    I haven't heard an apology.
          
          Michael drops to one knee.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm really sorry I hurt your
                    feelings. I got a little carried
                    away. Can you ever forgive me?
          
          Letty takes the book from him and walks away.
          
          INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty sits in an arm chair staring out at the garden. Her
          attention is drawn to a nearby couch where Michael sits
          opposite Mrs. Hallstrom, apparently playing cards.
          
          Michael lays a card down.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, I'm pretty sure you
                    could use that.
          
          She shakes her head slowly back and forth.   Michael places it
          in her hand of cards.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Now, don't you have a gin rummy,
                    Mrs. Hallstrom?
                        (beat)
                    Go ahead, now, just lay those cards
                    down.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom slowly spreads her hand of cards on the couch.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hot damn. Gin rummy. I told you
                    so. You're three games up on me.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom smiles. Michael catches Letty watching them,
          and Letty quickly looks away.
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty opens her drawer to pull out a T-shirt. Several are
          rumpled. She starts refolding them when she spots it.
          
          There, nestled among her clothes, is a book of Emily
          Dickinson's poetry. Letty picks it up, runs her hand over
          the cover and starts reading.
          
          EXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Paul and Letty walk onto a postcard-perfect stone terrace
          overlooking the garden. Paul pulls up a chair for Letty and
          stares out at the scenery.
          
                              PAUL
                    It's prettier here than I thought
                    it would be.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, I guess it's all right.
          
                              PAUL
                    Are you all right?
          
                              LETTY
                    That's a big question.
          
                              PAUL
                    I hope it wasn't something I did.
          
                              LETTY
                    Something you did?
          
                              PAUL
                    That put you in here.
          
                               LETTY
                    Of course not, no.
                        (beat)
                    Is that why you're here?
          
                              PAUL
                    I think we need to talk about some
                    things.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yes, I suppose so.
          
                              PAUL
                    This has been really difficult,
                    this whole thing.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                     49.
                               PAUL(cont'd)
                    These past few weeks, it's made me
                    really go back and examine our
                    whole relationship.
                        (beat)
                    I mean, we've been going out for
                    four years, and it hasn't always
                    been so easy.
          
                              LETTY
                    No.
          
                              PAUL
                    Especially this last year.
          
                              LETTY
                        (softly)
                    Especially now.
          
                              PAUL
                    So, I've been thinking a lot...
          
                              LETTY
                    I have too, Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    I talked to Ruth a little bit, and
                    I think it's about time...
          
                              LETTY
                    I know. We can't just keep going
                    through the motions.
          
                               PAUL
                    Exactly. It's time to make
                    decisions.
          
                              LETTY
                    You don't have to say anything
                    else. I've known for a while that
                    this was coming.
          
                              PAUL
                    I just wish we'd done it sooner.
          
          Paul takes Letty's hand in his.
          
                              PAUL
                    Will you marry me?
          
          Paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on
          Letty's finger. She stares at it, mesmerized.
          
                                                            50.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    I had to smuggle it in here. I
                    guess you're not really supposed to
                    have jewelry.
          
                              LETTY
                        (by rote)
                    Or be up past ten or fraternize
                    with other patients.
          
                                PAUL
                    I hope you like it. It's a Marquis
                    cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with
                    emeralds around it, but this was
                    simpler, more classic in its lines.
                         (beat)
                    L
                     Letty?
          
                              LETTY
                    It's, it's really nice, Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    You can take it back and we can
                    have one custom made if you want.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, you've done a perfect job.
          
                              PAUL
                    So, what do you say, Let?
          
          Letty looks him in the eyes for the first time.
          
                              LETTY
                    Do you think, really, that it's OK
                    to get engaged when I'm in here?
          
                              PAUL
                    Sure. We'll save the formal
                    announcement for when you're out. I
                    already told your mother. I hope
                    you don't mind.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, no.
          
                              PAUL
                    So will you?
          
                              LETTY
                        (working up a smile)
                    Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
          
          Paul and Letty kiss, then hug.
          
          EXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - LATER
          
          It's completely dark. Letty sits in the same position we saw
          her in hours ago. Michael walks up to her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You missed out on some great
                    broccoli florets at dinner.
          
                              LETTY
                    I wasn't hungry.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    John even managed to lob a load of
                    mashed potatoes into Mrs.
                    Hallstrom's milk.
          
                              LETTY
                        (smiling)
                    Finally. I was getting tired of
                    watching him try every night.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Was it bad news--the visit from
                    Peter?
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    He looked pretty serious.
          
                              LETTY
                    He asked me to marry him.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Very romantic setting.
          
                              LETTY
                    It was romantic.   He's very
                    romantic.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    So are you engaged, or what?
          
          Letty holds out her hand, where the diamond glistens. Michael
          bends forward to look at the ring, caressing her hand as he
          does so.
          
          Letty pulls away. The ring is gone.
          
                                                                    52.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    What have you done with the ring?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's magic.
          
          Letty stands up.
          
                              LETTY
                    This isn't funny.   Paul would kill
                    me.
          
          Michael holds his hands in fists toward Letty.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Guess which hand.
          
                              LETTY
                    Enough with the abracadabra.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Guess.
          
                              LETTY
                    T
                     he left one.
          
          Michael opens his hand.   It's empty.   Michael addresses an
          imaginary audience.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to audience)
                    The fair maiden guesses
                    incorrectly. Should we give her
                    one more try?
                        (to Letty)
                    The audience says one more try.
                    What guess you now?
          
                              LETTY
                    The right one.
          
          Michael opens his right hand. A plastic, Cracker-jack ring
          rests in it.
          
                              LETTY
                    Come on, Michael.
          
          Michael grabs Letty's hand and slides the ring onto her
          finger.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    With this ring, I thee...
          
                                                                 53.
          
          
          
          Letty pulls her hand away.
          
                              LETTY
                    Really, this isn't funny.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    OK, OK, I'll give it back.
          
          Letty holds out her hand.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    For a price.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Good God.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    A small price.
          
                              LETTY
                    I won't do your portion of kitchen
                    cleanup.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No.
          
                              LETTY
                    And I'm not covering for you when
                    you sneak out to call Dominos.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I want a kiss.
          
          Letty stares at him.    She laughs.
          
                              LETTY
                    Get serious.
          
          Michael moves close to her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm serious.
          
          Letty looks into his eyes.
          
                              LETTY
                        (softly)
                    Everything's a joke with you.
          
          Michael and Letty kiss, long and deep. Letty pulls back.
          She gazes at Michael. She steps closer to him.
          
          They kiss again, longer and deeper.
          
                                                                   54.
          
          
          
          They separate. Letty looks ready for another kiss.   Michael
          caresses her cheek.
          
          He walks back toward the hospital door. He stops, comes back
          to Letty. He hands her the diamond ring.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Here.
          
          He walks inside.   Letty watches him go.
          
          INT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Dr. Emlee and Letty sit across from each other.
          
                              LETTY
                    The medicine's still bothering me.
                    It feels like I have cotton wrapped
                    around my brain.
          
                                DR. EMLEE
                    We'll see about adjusting the
                    dosage if that doesn't clear in the
                    next (week.
                          beat)
                    How are other things going?
          
                              LETTY
                    I think I've told you all the news.
                    Let's see--the engagement. Oh, and
                    my sister's coming to visit me, and
                    they say my cat misses me.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    The question, Letty, is how are you
                    feeling?
          
                              LETTY
                    I miss Beast a lot, too.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Darkness. Michael sleeps. A Christmas Carol BLASTS through
          the intercom system.
          
                              INTERCOM
                    Hark the Herald Angels sing...
          
          Michael bolts awake. He stumbles out of bed, in wildly
          striped boxers, and races toward the hall.
          
                                                                     55.
          
          
          
          INT.   HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          Doors open like kernels of popcorn exploding.   Michael,
          Marie, Thomas, John, then Letty.
          
          The music BLARES on. Nurse Gates runs down the hall and
          shouts to Michael.
          
                               NURSE GATES
                     What are you doing?
          
                               MICHAEL
                         (yelling)
                     Not me.
          
          The music lowers. Mrs. Hallstrom, in a Santa cap, appears.
          She distributes erasers as she threads through the patients.
          
                                MRS. HALLSTROM
                     Sorry, sorry. Candy canes are out
                     of season.
          
                               NURSE GATES
                     Mrs. Hallstrom?
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom gives an eraser to the nurse.
          
                                NURSE GATES
                     Come on. Come with me, Mrs.
                     Hallstrom.
          
          Nurse Gates leads Mrs. Hallstrom away as the older woman
          continues tossing erasers down the hall.
          
          Marie stares at Michael's shorts.
          
                               MARIE
                     Hot boxers.
          
          Michael smiles awkwardly at Letty. She returns to her room.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Letty climbs into bed. She opens the bedside drawer, and
          pulls out a Tiffany's ring box. There, cradled in the satin
          lining, is the diamond from Paul. Right beside it is
          Michael's Cracker Jack special.
          L
          Letty puts on Paul's ring. She studies her hand. With an air
          of secrecy, she slips on Michael's ring. She quickly takes
          it off. Wearing Paul's ring, she turns off the light and
          snuggles into bed.
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
          
          EXT. GARDEN, HILLV IEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned
          hedges and tea roses. Letty and Ruth power-walk down a
          cobblestone path, heading away from the English Tudor
          hospital that looms large in the background.
          
          Letty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the
          University of South Carolina Cocks.
          
                               LETTY
                    I can't believe you finally gave me
                    the shirt.
          
                              RUTH
                    Loaned you. And it's only 'til you
                    get out of here.
          
                              LETTY
                    That settles it. I'm never leaving.
          
                              RUTH
                    I can hardly wait 'til you're free.
                    Planning the wedding without you
                    has been a disaster.
          
                              LETTY
                    You're slowing.
          
                              RUTH
                        (picking up the pace)
                    Mom and I fought for 20 minutes
                    over whether we should go with ecru
                    invitations or brilliant white.
          
          Letty checks her stop watch.
          
                              RUTH
                    What do you think?
          
                              LETTY
                    Ecru.
          
                              RUTH
                    And then the gold scroll or the
                    black Romanesque print?
          
          Letty completely stops and faces Ruth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Do we have to talk wedding details?
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
          
                              RUTH
                    Oh, no, of course not.
          
                              LETTY
                    I mean, you can always send me
                    fabric samples to look at or
                    pictures of dresses. But, it's
                    been so long since we've seen each
                    other.
          
                              RUTH
                    Of course. You're right. Besides,
                    we should be talking about your
                    engagement.
          
          They start walking again.
          
                              LETTY
                    Tell me more about Beast beating up
                    that other cat.
          
                                RUTH
                    Bloody furry mess, like I said.
                        (beat)
                    Aren't you so excited about Paul?
                        (
                          beat)
                    Letty?
          
          Ruth stops this time.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's going on with you, Letty?
          
                              LETTY
                    Ruthie, do you ever wonder if
                    you'll meet someone else...someone
                    besides Jake?
          
          Power walking's forgotten.   Ruth and Letty start to amble.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's his name, Letty?
          
                              LETTY
                    I didn't say...
          
                              RUTH
                    Don't even try.    What's his name?
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Nurse Gates passes by the open door, and pokes her head in.
          
                                                                   58.
          
          
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Lights out, Letty.
          
          Letty closes the door. She pulls a nightshirt from a drawer,
          disrupting a perfectly-folded T-shirt. Letty bends down to
          straighten it, but changes her mind. She shuts the drawer.
          
          Letty puts on the nightshirt, crawls into bed and snaps off
          the light. She fluffs her pillow, and turns over. She rolls
          back.
          
          Letty turns on the light. She goes to the drawer, opens it,
          pulls out the T-shirt and refolds it. She shuts the drawer.
          Letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork.
          
          It's a fight with the drawer. Opened and closed. Until Letty
          takes a deep breath, pulls it open a final time, hesitantly
          ruffles the T-shirt and slams the drawer shut.
          
          She runs to bed and hops in, turning off the light and
          burying her head under the pillow.
          
          A few moments pass.
          
          A KNOCK on the door. Letty opens it to find Michael.
          
                              LETTY
                    We're supposed to be asleep.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Exactly.
          
          Michael takes Letty's hand and pulls her toward the door.
          
                              LETTY
                    We'll get caught.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No rounds for another three hours.
          
          Michael checks the hallway and pulls Letty into it.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Nervous? Scared? Worried you're
                    not fit for a caper of epic
                    proportions?

                    Rendezvous at the closet in 30.

          Letty forges ahead to the nurses' station, while Michael
          turns a corner in the hall, peeking out so he can watch Letty
          approach Nurse Gates.

                    There's a spider in my room.

                              LETTY
                    It's got a green dot on its back.
                    I can't go to sleep with it
                    watching me.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Sounds awful. I guess we better
                    check it out.
          
          Letty and Nurse Gates walk down the hall to Letty's room,
          passing the alcove where Michael lurks in the shadows. He
          sneaks into the main hall and pads up to the nurses' station.

          Michael wanders around the desk, crouches on the floor so he
          can't be seen from the hallway and pulls the phone down to
          his level. He dials.

          the guard, JIM, who blocks his path.

                    I'm afraid I can't let you take

                    It's a pizza.

                    You don't understand. This is a
                    very important, very special,
                    morale-boosting pizza.
          
                              JIM

                    gets when you're posted at a guard

          Reluctantly, Michael opens the pizza box, and Jim helps
          himself to two slices. Michael starts to shut the box. Jim
          reaches in for a third slice.

          Michael passes the open door with the pizza box and points
          down the hall. Letty stares right through him.

                    He was graduating from law school,
                    and he just assumed I was OK with

                    We never really talked about it.

          and lets Letty in, gesturing for her to sit. They lean
          against a stack of pillows.

                    Shhh.
          
          A SERIES OF SHOTS THAT FADE INTO EACH OTHER:
          
          A.) The two munch on pizza. Michael picks off black olives
          and hands them to Letty, who plops them on top of her pizza.
          
          B.) Michael hands Letty a cigarette. She gestures no.       He
          lights one for himself and begins blowing smoke rings.
          
          C.) Michael offers Letty pizza.     She clutches her stomach to
          show that she's full.
          
          D.) Letty indicates she wants a cigarette. Michael
          demonstrates how to smoke, affecting the style of a 1930s
          movie star. Letty follows suit.
          E
           .) Letty grabs a pillow and hits Michael over the head. He
          pulls the pillow away from her. Letty stands up, grabs
          another pillow and hits Michael again. He whacks her in the
          back of the knees and she falls on top of him.
          
          Enough of the fighting.    They kiss.   Michael strokes the back
          of Letty's neck.
          
          FOOTSTEPS approach the door and stop. Michael and Letty stop
          kissing and look at the door. The FOOTSTEPS continue on.
          
          Michael pulls Letty's shirt up. She starts to pull it over
          her head, but can't get it all the way off in the cramped
          space. Michael kisses Letty's mouth through the shirt. She
          GIGGLES. Michael helps Letty off with the shirt.
          
          He kisses her chest.    Letty bites him lightly on the
          shoulder.
          
          Michael pulls away in surprise, grinning. Letty reaches up
          and bites him again. Michael bites her back.
          
                                                                      64.
          
          
          
          Letty reaches her hands behind her head, searching for
          something to hold onto. She grabs a stack of sheets, which
          topple onto Michael.
          
          Michael sits up, trying to clear the sheets off himself and
          Letty. Letty pushes him down and crawls on top of him.

                                                                   65.

          Letty and Michael, partially disrobed and hugging each other
          tight, burst into GUFFAWS.
          
          INT.   EMLEE'S OFFICE - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty sits on the couch.   Emlee leans forward in his chair.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     I think it's a problem that you
                     never told me about Michael. I had
                     to hear it from another patient.
          
                               LETTY
                     I couldn't really say anything
                     because of that fraternizing rule.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Well, Letty, this does present a
                     liability issue for the hospital.
          
                               LETTY
                     I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I
                     can take care of myself.
                               D
                                R. EMLEE
                     What about Michael? Do you know
                     the extent of his...
          
                               LETTY
                     I know Michael's a schizophrenic,
                     and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic-
                     depressive, and John Lockyer has
                     episodes of psychosis, and I heard
                     a rumor that you suffer from
                     delusions of grandeur.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Go ahead and put the guard back up,
                     Letty. But you need to know what
                     you're dealing with.
          
                               LETTY
                     I don't need a lecture.   I care
                     about Michael.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Then that's even more reason to
                     listen. Look, schizophrenics tend
                     to withdraw from reality. They
                     experience emotional disturbances
                     that result in personality changes.

                    You could be lying next to Michael
                    in bed one night, and he could have
                    a hallucination, or a delusion. It
                    might happen when you're driving
                    or...
          
                              LETTY
                    Look, I know he's almost through
                    with treatment here. And, he's on
                    medication.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    Drugs can help suppress symptoms.
                    But lots of patients stop taking
                    them when they're on their own
                    because the side effects are so
                    harsh.
                        (beat)
                    And, Michael's condition is often
                    worsened by periods of stress. He's
                    been in and out of...
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't want to hear anymore.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I'd like you to promise you won't
                    carry on a relationship with
                    Michael. Otherwise, I'll consider
                    moving one of you to another ward.
          
                              LETTY
                    First you tell me to do what I want
                    to, then you tell me to stop.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    All I want you to do is think about
                    what's best for you. Really think
                    about it.

          Letty lies in the middle of a copse of trees, reading Emily
          Dickinson. Michael walks up and hands her a dandelion.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    A daisy for the lady.

                    Sounds important.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
          
                                LETTY
                    Really?    Me too.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I had to sneak by the guards to get
                    here. They say you're highly
                    unstable, have a depressive
                    personality, and may hold back my
                    own recovery.
          
                                LETTY
                    Wow.    I'm bad news.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What's my rap?

                    Fuck.    That's all true.
          
          Letty laughs.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Really, though. My thoughts go
                    haywire sometimes.
          
                              LETTY
                    What are the delusions like?
          
                               MICHAEL
                    I think people are after me, crap
                    like that.

                    trees get planted in rich top soil,
                    and they grow right up to the sun,
                    tall and straight. Other trees,
                    they start as seeds in the crevices
                    between rocks so they have to twist
                    and bend to reach the light.
                        (beat)
                    But even though they end up
                    crooked, they're still trees, just
                    like the straight ones.
          
          Lying on their backs, Michael and Letty stare up at the
          leaves overhead.

                    Why in the world did you let me
                    start talking in metaphors? That's
                    no way for us to break up.

          By the time the patients round the corner, the Federal
          Express man is leaving, and Mrs. Hallstrom has ripped open
          one of the boxes. She clutches a handful of jewelry.

          She hands Michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings. He clips
          them on. Letty and several others carry necklaces. Thomas
          sports a rhinestone tiara. The patients compare jewelry.

                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Don't worry, Doctor, I didn't
                    forget you.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom hands Dr. Emlee a fake ruby hair comb.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you can't possibly
                    afford to pay for this. It must go
                    back.
          
          Chatter in the hallway stops.
          
                                                                   71.
          
          
          
                               MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Why, no, Doctor. It can't. Most
                    of it's for my daughter, Lily.
                    She's coming to family day
                    tomorrow...all the way from
                    Cleveland with my grandson.
                        (beat)
                    You can't be taking away their
                    "Welcome to California" presents.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    It's going back. We'll contact the
                    company this afternoon.
                        (to patients)
                    Take the jewelry off, please.
          
                               M
          The patients reluctantly remove their gifts.
          
                               RS. HALLSTROM
                    But I have to keep something for my
                    daughter.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Let's go back to group, and discuss
                    it there. Back to group, everyone.
          
          The patients head back to group.   Dr. Emlee turns to Nurse
          Gates.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                        (to Nurse Gates)
                    Increase her lithium to 600
                    milligrams, three times a day. Oh,
                    and Nurse, let's see about
                    canceling the cable.
          
          EXT. PATIO - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          The place buzzes with festivity. A "WELCOME FAMILIES" sign
          hangs from a patio beam. A table is laden with cookies and
          lemonade and platter after platter of carrot curls.
          
          Letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where Michael
          plays frisbee with his family, even his grandmother, ROSA.
          Nurse Gates walks up to Letty.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Your mother's in the rec room,
                    Letty.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
          INT. REC ROOM - SAME
          
          Letty passes Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits by herself, holding one
          small gift on her lap.
          
          Letty spots her Mom across the room, and walks up to her.
          Her mother has covered a table with swatches of fabric.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    It's so good to see you,
                    Sweetheart.
          
                              LETTY
                    You too, Mom.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    You're looking good.    A little
                    thin, but good.
          
          Letty examines a fabric sample.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Thanks so much for doing this.
                    Ruthie and Jake are up to a million
                    things. And I just can't decide.
          
          Letty rearranges the fabric samples on the table by color.
          
                              LETTY
                    Which flowers did you order?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    We haven't. I wanted to talk that
                    over with you, too.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, OK, well, better to choose the
                    table cloths first anyway.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I
                      was thinking either the peach
                    moire or cream damask.
          
          Letty holds up a swatch of bright yellow.
          
                              LETTY
                    This would complement the blue in
                    the bride's maids' dresses. Look.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Where's your ring, Sweetheart?
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    We aren't allowed to wear jewelry
                    in here, Mom.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    Just think, pretty soon, we'll be
                    doing all these wedding
                    preparations for you.
                        (beat)
                    Of course, if that's what you still
                    want. Ruthie told me some silly
                    story about a crush on some boy
                    here.
          
          Letty pulls out a cigarette, lights it and starts smoking.
          
                              LETTY
                    I haven't had a crush since I was
                    12.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    When did you start smoking?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll put it out if it bothers you.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    The puckering, dear. It doesn't
                    seem so now, but in time, it will
                    cause wrinkles around the mouth.
          
          Letty grinds the cigarette beneath her heel.    She bends over
          the fabrics.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    You know, your life isn't about
                    being in a mental hospital.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I hear this Michael fellow is
                    schizophrenic.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, please.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Don't forget that Paul's a
                    promising young attorney who loves
                    you very much...
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul,
                    I'll dump him. If I want to screw
                    Michael or live with him or marry
                    him, then I'll do that.
          
          Thomas, who sits across the room, looks up from his book.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (whispering)
                    I'm only looking out for you.
          
                              LETTY
                        (yelling)
                    And if I want to smoke, I'll
                    fucking smoke.
          
          Letty races out the door and into the garden. In the
          distance, Michael spots her and jogs over. Letty's mother
          watches them. Thomas approaches Mrs. Mayer.
          
                              THOMAS
                    Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I
                    couldn't help overhearing. I just
                    wanted to say, not that it's any of
                    my business...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Yes?
          
                              THOMAS
                    I think, really, I think I'd go
                    with the cream damask.
          I
           NT. REC ROOM - LATER
          
          Letty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining
          hall. Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs. Hallstrom, who
          sits where we last saw her.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    It's OK to be upset.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                        (gaily)
                    Upset? Why of course not. My
                    goodness, no. I'm sure she just
                    got hung up.
          
          Letty and Michael stop.
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join
                    my family for dinner. You'll love
                    my Grandma Rosa.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    That's so sweet, Michael. But,
                    really, I've so many things to do.
          
                              LETTY
                    If you change your mind, we'll be
                    in the dining hall.
          
          Michael and Letty walk on, exchanging a sad look.
          
          INT. DINING HALL - LATER
          
          Mr. Santucci and Mrs. Santucci sit at the heads of the table.
          Letty sits between Rosa and Michael.
          
                              ROSA
                        (to Letty)
                    What do you need now?
                        (to Mr. Santucci)
                    Send down the lamb. This girl's as
                    thin as a stick.
          
                               LETTY
                    Oh, no.   I'm stuffed.
          
                              ROSA
                    Tell her to eat, Frank.
          
                               MR. SANTUCCI
                    Mangia.   Mangia.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (whispering to Letty)
                    You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's
                    lamb.
          
                              ROSA
                    Or my eggplant. I make the best
                    eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I
                    use, it's so fresh it sweats.
          
          Letty heaps more food on her plate.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    Michael says you're a teacher.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I was. I'm hoping I'll still have
                    a job when I get out.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her Christmas
          stocking cap. She starts to dispense erasers.
          
                              LETTY
                    What's she doing?
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on Grandma
          Rosa. She hands Rosa the gift meant for her daughter.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Rosa, Rosa, you must have this,
                    Rosa.
          
                              ROSA
                    Grazie.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please.
          
          But, by this point, Mrs. Hallstrom's already bounded away,
          divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered
          parents and delighted children.
          
          She clambers onto a table in the middle of the room. Marie
          gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho,
                    ho, ho.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, we've got to stop her.
          
          Michael pushes back his chair.   He's trapped between the
          table and the wall.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    My goodness, it's so very warm in
                    here. So warm.
          
          She takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking
          man. But she doesn't stop there. With haphazard abandon, she
          begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Way, way, way too warm for
                    December. Now, let's sing Jingle
                    Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the
                    way...
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          
          The group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior.
          Then, almost as one, the patients spring into action.
          
          Michael bolts over his dining table and runs to Mrs.
          Hallstrom. He jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the
          dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her.
          
          By this time, John, Thomas and Letty have surrounded her in a
          protective enclave. Michael sets Mrs. Hallstrom on the
          ground. She looks up at the group, and continues belting out
          I
          "Jingle Bells."
          
           NT. LINEN CLOSET - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty and Michael lie on the floor next to each other,
          trading puffs on a cigarette. The glowing ember is the only
          light in the room.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You must have thought about it.
                    Everyone does.
          
                               LETTY
                    I just want to see Beast.
                        (beat)
                    Where would you go?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The mission up in Santa Barbara.
          
                              LETTY
                    No way.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That's where I always go when I get
                    out.
          
                              LETTY
                    Why?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    My dad used to take me there when I
                    was little. It's totally quiet.
                    And you can see the ocean for
                    miles.
          
          They smoke for a while.
          
                              LETTY
                    What else would you do?
          
                                                          78.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'd like to drink a bottle of red
                    wine with you and then make love to
                    you and spend the whole night
                    together. And we'd get up in the
                    morning and spend hours lounging
                    around and reading the paper.
          
                              LETTY
                    And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed
                    from the can.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How can you even mention Spaghetti-
                    O's after eating Grandma Rosa's
                    dinner tonight?
          
                              LETTY
                    I have a terrible confession.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Tell the doctor.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't like lamb.
          
          Michael sits up.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Then it's over.
          
                                LETTY
                    Lie down.
          
          Michael lies down.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's a good thing my family loves
                    you.
          
                              LETTY
                    Your family just met me.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You're right. I guess I was
                    projecting. What I should have
                    said is, "It's a good thing I love
                    you."
          
                                LETTY
                    Do you?
          
                                                                       79.
          
          
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I do.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, I...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's OK. You don't have to say
                    anything.
          
                                 LETTY
                    But I do.     I love you, too.
          
          Michael and Letty lie still, looking into each others eyes.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          P
           osters of Harry Houdini and Doug Henning.       Handcuffs and
          card decks all over.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Your Honor, I feel I should be
                    released. I'm sufficiently able to
                    look after...
          
          Michael stops. His eyes glaze over.        His head darts toward
          the corner of the room.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to the corner)
                    What? What?
          
          Nothing's there.   Nothing at all.    But Michael keeps staring.
          
          A KNOCK on the door. Michael's eyes refocus.       He opens the
          door to find Letty.
          
                              LETTY
                    John and Nurse Gates are waiting
                    for you.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I
                    look?
          
                               LETTY
                        (straightening his tie)
                    Great. I came to tell you to break
                    a leg, and to give you this for
                    good luck.
          
          Letty hands him the Cracker Jack ring.
          
                                                                     80.
          
          
          
          INT. COMMITMENT COURT - DAY
          
          Michael sits near the front of the courtroom with half a
          dozen other patients from various institutions.
          
          Nurse Gates sits a few rows back near JOHN'S MOTHER and
          Michael's family--Mr. and Mrs. Santucci and Grandma Rosa.
          
          JUDGE MILTON, 60s, questions John, who's on the stand.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Why have you petitioned to leave
                    the institution?
          
                              JOHN
                    I haven't had an episode in more
                    than a month, Sir.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    How do you plan to support
                    yourself?
          
                              JOHN
                    My family's helping me out, Your
                    Honor.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Where will you live upon release?
          
                                JOHN
                    Live?
          
          John's mother nods encouragingly at him.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Where do you plan to reside, Mr.
                    Lockyer?
          
                              JOHN
                    With my mother.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Is your mother here today?
          
          John points to her.   John's mother waves at the judge.
          
                              JOHN
                    That's the bitch. That cock-
                    sucking bitch. She put me here.
                    She did. She's the Satan that did
                    this all.
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          
          As bailiffs remove John from the stand, Michael offers a wan
          smile to his family.
          
          INT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER
          
          Michael, outwardly poised and collected, sits on the stand.
          His hands are clenched in tight fists.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    The records indicate no major
                    episodes in the past four months.
                    And it seems you have the support
                    of the staff.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Yes, Sir.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    But I see you've been in and out of
                    the hospital more than ten times.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Eleven, Your Honor.   But I'm on a
                    new medication now.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Do you feel ready to re-enter the
                    world?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yes, Sir. My family is    prepared to
                    support me until I find   a job.
                    They've already located   an
                    apartment for me that's   very near
                    them.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Very well, then. By order of the
                    court, you are released. I wish
                    you good luck.
          
          Michael's shoulders relax. He opens his fist. Inside is the
          Cracker Jack ring, and the magenta circle it has imprinted on
          his palm.
          
          EXT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER
          
          Michael walks to the car with his mother, father and
          grandmother, who keeps tousling his hair with pride.
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
          
          INT. VISITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty stands awkwardly in front of Paul, who sits in a
          wingback chair.
          
                              PAUL
                    What's so urgent?   You've got me
                    worried.
          
                              LETTY
                    I need to tell you something, and
                    I'm not sure how.
          
          Paul stands.
          
                               PAUL
                    You can tell me anything.
                        (beat)
                    Do you want to postpone the
                    wedding? Is it too much pressure?
          
                                LETTY
                    No...
          
                              PAUL
                    That's a load off my mind.
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul, I want to break off the
                    engagement.
                              P
                                 AUL
                    You what?
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't mean to hurt you.    I know
                    this is a terrible thing.    And I
                    have really loved you.
          
                              PAUL
                    Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me?
                    Letty, it's natural to be nervous.
                    But we're going to work through our
                    problems.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've met someone else.
          
                                PAUL
                    Who?
          
                              LETTY
                    It doesn't matter who.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    Have you been seeing another
                    teacher?
          
                              LETTY
                    No.
          
                              PAUL
                    It's a doctor, isn't it? That's
                    unethical. I'll have him rung up
                    on malpractice charges so fast his
                    head will spin.
          
                              LETTY
                    He's a patient here.
          
          Paul considers this a moment.
          
                              PAUL
                    Of all the crazy things. I
                    understood when you dropped out of
                    law school. And during this whole
                    mess, I've tried to be supportive.
                    But, really, Letty, what can you be
                    thinking?
          
                              LETTY
                    I love him.
          
                              PAUL
                    You're going to throw away our life
                    together for some shared experience
                    with a looney-tune that you
                    misguidedly think is love?
          
                              LETTY
                    Here's the ring.
          
                              PAUL
                    No way. You keep the ring.     You'll
                    come to your senses.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've made my decision, Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    You keep it, Letty. This is not
                    over. Our life is not over.
          
          EXT. FRONT STEPS - SAME
          
          Paul walks out the door and down the steps past Michael, who
          runs up them two at a time.
          
                                                                   84.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How's it hanging, Paul?
          
          Paul turns to watch Michael as Michael swings open the door
          and sails into the institute.
          
          INT. VISITING ROOM - SAME
          
          Letty waits as a NURSE opens the door to the ward.   Letty is
          about to step through, when Michael enters.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Visitor for Ms. Mayer.
          
          Letty whirls around.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Well?        M
                                  ICHAEL
                    Home free.
          
          Letty and Michael hug.
          
                              NURSE
                    Letty, Michael, you have about five
                    minutes until visiting hours end.
          
          The nurse retreats.
          
                              LETTY
                    Tell me all.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was brilliant, or at least
                    boringly sane.
          
                              LETTY
                    So there were no problems?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Not a one.
          
                              LETTY
                    And did you go to the mission?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No, you goof, I came to see you.
          
                              LETTY
                    Just checking.
          
                                                                   85.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the
                    dirty deed?
          
                                 LETTY
                    Yeah.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    So, it's over?
          
                               LETTY
                    All over.
                        (beat)
                    Did you see your new apartment?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    One bedroom, second floor, no view.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Furnished?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No, I need some serious household
                    advice.
          
                              LETTY
                    First off, you'll need to go to
                    Target. And, let's see, what
                    should you buy?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I better make a list.
          
                              LETTY
                    List schmist. You'll remember.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty sits in the corridor opposite Marie and Thomas.   They
          are playing BLACKJACK. Letty deals.
          
                                 THOMAS
                    Hit me.
          
          Letty hands one over.    Thomas flips over his cards.
          
                                 THOMAS
                    I'm over.
          
          Letty looks to Marie, who waves her off. Marie is fine with
          her cards. They look down the hall. Nurse Gates walks beside
          JAMIE, a man in his late 20s, who wears the same dazed
          expression Letty did the morning after she was admitted.
          
                                                                     86.
          
          
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (to Jamie)
                    Dr. Stone will ask you some
                    questions, and then we'll get you
                    settled.
          
          Nurse Gates and Jamie come upon the gang.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (to Letty/Bill)
                    Lights out in 15, Guys.
          
          Nurse Gates continues down the hall, hand firmly planted
                               M
          under Jamie's elbow as he weaves unsteadily beside her.
          
                               ARIE
                    Wow, that first night is hard.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's going to be a difficult few
                    weeks for him.
          
                              THOMAS
                    It really makes you think.
          
                              LETTY
                    It really does.
          
          They look down the hall at the retreating figures.   They look
          at each other.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'll put in 5 that it's a straight
                    diagnosis of depressive
                    personality.
          
                              LETTY
                    Are you kidding? With those glazed
                    eyes? I'm willing to bet 10 there
                    was some break with reality going
                    on there. Psychosis. Without a
                    doubt, psychosis.
          
          INT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Letty is curled up in a chair opposite Dr. Emlee.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what I really can't believe is
                    that I'm starting to actually miss
                    work.
          
                                                                  87.
          
          
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Have you been in contact with the
                    principal about your job?
          
                              LETTY
                    I thought about calling, but I want
                    to wait until I know when I'll be
                    out.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Then, you should call.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I think it's about that time,
                    Letty. The charges against you
                    have been dropped, the drugs have
                    evened out and you seem to be
                    dealing with your life quite well.
          
                              LETTY
                    Are you saying I'm through with
                    therapy?
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    Let's not be hasty.
                        (beat)
                    I'm saying we should plan a release
                    date for early next week.
          
          Off Letty's excited face, we
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. TARGET - DAY
          
          Crowds, crowds and more crowds. Michael pulls unsuccessfully
          at a shopping cart that is stuck to another.
          
          A MATRONLY WOMAN walks up, nudges Michael out of the way and
          yanks the cart out of its row. She rolls it toward Michael,
          grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store.
          M
           ichael takes several deep breaths. With trepidation in his
          step, he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store...
          
          
          EXT. TARGET - 30 MINUTES LATER
          
                                                                   88.
          
          
          
          Michael emerges from the store, quite pleased with himself
          that he made it out alive. He commands a cart heaped full of
          useless gadgets and trinkets, a half dozen picture frames and
          about 20 decorative pillows.
          
          EXT. GROUNDS - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Must you walk so quickly?
          
                              LETTY
                    It's good exercise, Mom.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I've got 26 years on you. If we
                    could just slow down, we could talk
                    so much easier.
          
          Letty slackens her pace.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I'm so thankful you'll be leaving
                    next week. If you want me to pick
                    you up, I will.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've already made arrangements.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Ruthie mentioned that Michael might
                    be coming for you.
          
          Letty stops and wags her finger at her mother.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but
                    you're not allowed to mention
                    Michael.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Not even if it's something
                    positive?
          
                               LETTY
                    Nyet.   That's the condition.
          
          Mother and daughter keep walking in silence.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Have you spoken to Paul at all?
          
                                                                     89.
          
          
          
                               LETTY
                     One more and you're out.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                     Honestly, Letty.
          
                               LETTY
                     A deal's a deal.
          
          The two walk on in silence.
          
          Silence.
          
          More silence.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                     Have you heard the figure on how
                     much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay
                     in taxes this year?
          
          Letty stops walking. She turns a sunny smile on her mother,
          then hugs her.      L
                               LETTY
                     I knew you had it in you.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty neatly folds garments and lays them in a suitcase.    Dr.
          Emlee looks on.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     So, we'll meet every Tuesday and
                     Friday. And if you have any kind
                     of emergency, you can page me.
          
                               LETTY
                     OK, good. That's good. Thanks an
                     awful lot for everything, and for
                     coming down here to see me off.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     It was just a little going-away
                     gesture.
          
                               LETTY
                     I have a going-away gesture for
                     you, too.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Oh?
          
                                                                    90.
          
          
          
          Letty puts her hand in her suitcase and rummages through the
          clothes, creating a jumbled mess. She snaps the luggage
          closed. Bits of clothing hang out. They LAUGH.
          
          INT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty sets her duffel bag down next to two suitcases. She
          hugs Marie, John, Thomas, then walks over to Mrs. Hallstrom,
          who hangs back from the group. Letty embraces her.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll miss you, Mrs. Hallstrom.
          
          There's no response.    Letty goes to Nurse Gates and hugs her.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Take care, Letty. And, let me know
                    if you need help with any spiders.
          
                              LETTY
                    You know I will.       Thanks for
                    everything.
          
          Letty walks toward Michael, who gathers up her bags.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    See you later, guys.
          
          Michael and Letty walk through the VISITING ROOM...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Aren't you supposed to throw a
                    bouquet or something?
          
                              LETTY
                    Aren't you ever quiet?
          
          They walk out the doors onto the FRONT STEPS OF THE HOSPITAL.
          Michael grabs Letty's hand as they hurry down the steps.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Where to?
          
                              LETTY
                    I've heard the mission in Santa
                    Barbara is the place to go.
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - MAGIC HOUR
          
          In the background, the Spanish-style mission blends into the
          hillside. Letty and Michael sit on a bluff, holding hands.
          They look out at the ocean, where the sun heads toward the
          waves in a fiery red glow.
          
                                                                    91.
          
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Michael and Letty walk down the hall. Michael stops at a door
          and showcases it. He jingles the keys.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
          
                                LETTY
                    Open up.    I want to see.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Close your eyes.
          
          Letty claps her hands over her eyes.    Michael opens the door
          and guides her into his castle.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME
          
                                MICHAEL
                    OK.    Open them.
          
          Letty surveys the territory. Forget tables, chairs and
          couches. Throw pillows are strewn everywhere.
          
                                LETTY
                    Wow.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You like it?
          
          Letty picks up a pillow and runs her hand over the fabric.
          She pauses a moment before speaking.
          
                              LETTY
                    I love the pillows.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Throw pillows, Letty. The sales
                    lady said they're the latest thing.
          
                              LETTY
                    Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
          
          Michael leads Letty to the bedroom.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - SAME
          
          A futon bed, draped with a mosquito net, rests in the corner.
          Two TVs take center stage.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's TV heaven.
          
                                                                  92.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was tired of watching what
                    everyone else wants to watch. Now
                    we can watch two shows at once.
          
                              LETTY
                    Let's try out the bed.
          
          Michael grabs her hand and pulls her toward the door.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You've got to see the kitchen
                    first.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Do you like it?
          
                              LETTY
                    I love your apartment.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Really?
          
                              LETTY
                    You'll never get rid of me.
          
          Michael kisses Letty on the lips.
          
                              LETTY
                    What do you say we go out to dinner
                    to celebrate?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Out? Are you kidding?     I've got
                    all the fixings here.
          
          Off Letty's look of surprise, we watch Michael open a
          cupboard door. The shelves are filled from top to bottom
          with cans of Spaghetti-O's.
          
          Letty squeezes Michael in a bear hug.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Letty, in a T-shirt, and Michael, in boxers, lounge on the
          futon. They watch both TVs -- one tuned-in to Jay Leno, the
          other to David Letterman.
          
          Michael eats from a can of Spaghetti-O's. Letty reaches over
          with her fork and snags a mouthful from Michael's can.
          
                                                                       93.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    How can you not like the Top 10
                    List?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I like it.     But Headlines are
                    better.
          
                              LETTY
                    You're so wrong.
          
          Letty takes her remote and increases the volume on her TV.
          As Letterman gets louder, Michael zaps his volume.
          
          It's a war. Letterman then Leno get LOUDER and LOUDER and
          LOUDER until Letty makes a might lunge. She wrests Michael's
          remote from him. Letty MUTES both TVs.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's sex time.
          
          Michael mockingly checks his watch.    Letty climbs on top of
          him. Michael rolls on top of her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I think it's my turn.
          
          CLOSE on their faces as Michael gently licks the side of
          Letty's mouth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Did I get spaghetti sauce on my
                    face?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No.
          
          Michael licks Letty's nose.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Michael.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Shhhh.
          
          Michael and Letty look into each other's eyes, bathed in the
          blue light thrown off by the twin televisions.
          
          Michael places a pillow gently beneath Letty's head.    He
          caresses her face.
          
                                                                     94.
          
          
          
          Letty's eyes are alive to every look, every touch. Michael
          kisses her slowly on the forehead, the nose, and the lips.
          
          CLOSE on Letty's hands as she reaches up to stroke Michael's
          forehead and caress his temple.
          
          CLOSER on her hands as Letty runs them through Michael's
          hair, then twists a curly lock around her finger.
          
          SOFT MOANS as we
          
                                                         DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          CLOSE on Letty's hand, resting on the comforter on Michael's
          bed. The alarm clock RINGS. Letty's hand slaps it into
          submission.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Letty's still in bed, a look of bliss across her face.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Letty?   Rise and shine.
          
                                                         LETTY'S POV:
          
          Michael's face fills her vision.
          
                                                       BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty's eyes close.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Not yet.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll be forced to tickle you.
          
          Letty opens one eye and glares at him.
                               L
                                 LETTY
                    Go away.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How about this? It's 10:30.
          
          Letty bolts upright.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm supposed to meet the principal
                    in half an hour.
          
                                                                     95.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll see you tonight.
          
          Michael gives her a kiss and walks into the LIVING ROOM.
          
          Michael adjusts his tie. Letty, naked, runs into the room
          and throws her arms around his neck.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Good luck.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You, too. Kick ass today.
          
          Michael walks out the door. Letty thinks for a minute. She
          flings open the door and yells to Michael's retreating back.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - SAME
          
                              LETTY
                    My apartment tonight.   You can meet
                    Beast.
          
          Michael swings around.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
          
                                 LETTY
                    Yeah?
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (yelling)
                    You've got one hell of a great
                    body.
          
          The door across the hall opens. A LITTLE OLD MAN stares at
          Letty's naked figure. She slams Michael's apartment door.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME
          
          Letty collapses in GIGGLES.
          
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Letty sits across from the principal.
          
                               PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    I didn't have any choice but to
                    include the parents' letters in
                    your file.
          
                                                          96.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, I understand.     I know my
                    behavior was poor.
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    So, in light of how the parents
                    feel, and the fact the students are
                    doing so well with the substitute,
                    I don't think I can put you back in
                    the classroom just yet.
          
                              LETTY
                    Look, Gail, I've been a good
                    teacher.
          
                               PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    I know, Letty. But the incident
                    with Zach was frightening for the
                    children.
                        (beat)
                    Now if you'd come to me, explained
                    what was going on...
          
                              LETTY
                    Believe me, I wish I'd understood
                    what was going on. I've worked
                    really hard to get better.
                              P
                               RINCIPAL GAIL
                    I'm glad you're doing well.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've already thought about how to
                    tell the kids where I was.
          
          Letty hands the principal a letter.
          
                               LETTY
                    And I'd like to send the parents
                    this letter of explanation. With
                    your support, I think they can
                    accept me.
          
          The principal reads the letter.
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    It's a very nice letter. But I
                    have to go with what's best for the
                    students.
          
                              LETTY
                    What does that mean?
          
                                                                  97.
          
          
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    I need someone to work on budget
                    projections.
          
                              LETTY
                    Office work?
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    Or, of course, you could take a
                    sabbatical the rest of the year.
          
          INT. BANK - DAY
          
          Michael sits at a back desk with MR. SMYTHE, who wears a
          three-piece pin-striped suit and taps a pencil on his knee.
          
                              MR. SMYTHE
                    It's not that we're doubting your
                    intelligence, Mr. Santucci. But
                    your work history shows so many
                    interruptions.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I know, but as I said...
          
                               MR. SMYTHE
                    I appreciate your candor about your
                    illness, but my bosses are
                    concerned.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I can do the job.
          
                              MR. SMYTHE
                    Between you and me, my uncle, he
                    has some mental problems, and I
                    know what you're going through. If
                    it were up to me, I'd hire you.
          
          Michael's already standing.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Right.   Thanks for your help.
          
          He shakes Mr. Smythe's hand, and, downcast, gets out of the
          bank as quickly as he can.
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Letty sits on the floor. She gulps down some aspirin, then
          hauls Beast into her lap. The doorbell RINGS.
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          
                                 LETTY
                    It's open.
          
          Michael walks in, and looks around.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Thanks.
          
          He kisses her, and lies down on the floor to stroke the cat.
                               M
                               ICHAEL
                    This must be Beast.
          
                              LETTY
                    That's Mr. Beast to you.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How was your day?
          
                              LETTY
                    I bombed. It's either work in the
                    office or nothing.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Sounds grim.
          
                                LETTY
                    Yeah.    How was the job search?
          
          Michael makes a thumbs-down gesture.
          
                              LETTY
                    Who ever said sanity was fun?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Promise?
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Promise.
                        (beat)
                    As long as we have steak.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Steak?
          
                                                                     99.
          
          
          
                               MICHAEL
                    It's a well-known fact that a red-
                    meat dinner can cure the blues.
                        (beat)
                    You and Beast wait here. I'll be
                    back in a jiff.
          
          Letty gives Michael a tired smile. Michael jumps up and
          leaves. A moment passes. The door opens again.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    While I'm gone why don't you slip
                    into something a little more naked?
          
          EXT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
          
          Michael walks out of the grocery store, loaded down with
          bags. He carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers.
          
          He passes two ladies who gossip outside the store.
          
                              LADY ONE
                    I can't believe he did that.
          
                              LADY TWO
                    What a weirdo.
          
          Michael stops abruptly.   He turns back and looks at the
          women. They LAUGH.
          
          Michael starts toward the car. He hears more LAUGHTER from
          the women. He turns back and walks up to them.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Don't ever talk about me again, you
                    hear me?
          
          The women pull back in fright.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Letty, in a skimpy negligee, lights candles on the table.
          Michael enters with the groceries and wine.
          
                              LETTY
                    I thought maybe you got lost.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The store was busy.
          
                              LETTY
                    You got wine. That's great.
          
          M

                              MICHAEL
                    Would you mind if we just called it
                    an early night?
          
                              LETTY
                    You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
                              M
                               ICHAEL
                    I think I should go home.
          
                              LETTY
                    Are you OK?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what about the red meat-blues
                    thing?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You know, we've got that dinner
                    with my parents tomorrow, too. I
                    should really get some rest
                    tonight.
          
          Michael gives Letty a kiss good night. He leaves. She
          stares after him. Reluctantly, she blows out the candles and
          starts putting the groceries away.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Beast)
                    How's filet sound?
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
          
          The coffee shop hasn't opened for business yet. Michael and
          six people in their early 20s fill out applications.
          
           ichael stares blankly at his application.    He fills out his
          name. He can't get any further.
          
          TWO OTHER APPLICANTS glance toward him.   Michael tries to
          write. He can't.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (under his breath)
                    No, no, no. Not now. No.
          
          The other applicants look toward Michael and quickly avert
          their eyes. The RESTAURANT MANAGER walks up to the group.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
          
          Michael grabs his briefcase and walks out of the restaurant.
          His application, incomplete, remains on the table.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SANTUCCI HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          This kitchen is the heart of the home--copper pots, two pasta
          makers and every size wooden spoon made.
          
          Letty, lightly dusted with flour, mixes fresh pasta with her
          hands. Mrs. Santucci peers into the bowl.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    More water. It's too pasty.
          
          Letty pours in more water.
          
                               LETTY
                    I'll never Mget the hang of this.
          
                               RS. SANTUCCI
                    All the Santucci women go through
                    this.
          
          Letty smiles at her and kneads harder.   Mr. Santucci enters
          and kisses his wife.
          
                              MR. SANTUCCI
                    Hi there, Letty.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Hi, Frank.
          
          Mr. Santucci looks in the pasta bowl.
          
                              MR. SANTUCCI
                    It needs more water.
          
          He dumps some in.   Letty looks sadly at the gloppy mess.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Mrs. Santucci)
                    Maybe we should make lamb next
                    week.
          
          Michael walks in.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    Hi, Sweetheart.
          
                              LETTY
                    How'd it go?
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
          
          Michael takes his tie, holds it up like a noose and lets his
          tongue loll out of his mouth.
          
                              LETTY
                    What happened?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Four interviews. Four no-gos.
          
                              LETTY
                    The restaurant, too?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I couldn't even face that one.
          
          Mr. and Mrs. Santucci look at each other.
          
                              LETTY
                    That's OK. We can call and
                    reschedule in the morning.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You don't have to take care of me,
                    you know.
          
          An uneasy silence falls in the room.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    Maybe we should save the job talk
                    for after dinner.
          
          Michael looks in the bowl of pasta dough that Letty continues
          to labor over. He reaches in to help with the mixing.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to Letty)
                    Just promise you'll love me even if
                    I end up in a job where I have to
                    wear a blue polyester cap.
          
                              LETTY
                    I think you know I'd love you even
                    more in a blue polyester cap.
          
          INT. BATHROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Michael finishes brushing his teeth. He opens the medicine
          cabinet, pulls out a prescription bottle and pours a pill
          into his hand.
          
                              LETTY (OS)
                    You're going to miss the Top Ten.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Coming.
          
          He raises the pill to his mouth, then opens his hand and lets
          it drop in the sink. Michael runs the water and watches the
          pill swirl slowly down the drain.
          
                              LETTY (OS)
                    Michael, hurry.
          
          Michael stuffs the pill bottle in a bottom drawer. He opens
          the door, sprints into the bedroom and leaps onto Letty, who
          lies on the futon. Letty SCREAMS and LAUGHS.
          
          INT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - DAY
          
          Michael sits in a booth drinking coffee. He bows over an
          application, pen in hand. About a third is filled out.
          
          INT. SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Letty and Superintendent Johansen sit on the floor, which is
          covered with math games, posters and charts.
          
                              LETTY
                    I think I could get the program up
                    and running in the next two weeks.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    From what I understand the
                    principal has removed you from
                    student activities.
          
                              LETTY
                    She's worried that I'm unstable.
          
          Johansen studies her.
          
                              LETTY
                    But I wouldn't push for the program
                    if I wasn't ready.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    What about the office work?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'd have to do that, too. But I've
                    gotten better at pacing myself.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    Are you sure?
          
                                                                  104.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll call you if I have problems.
                    Scout's honor.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    I have to say I'm inclined to give
                    it another try.
          
          Letty hugs Johansen.
          
                               JOHANSEN
                    But, Letty, why don't you give
                    yourself three weeks to set it up
                    this time?
          
          INT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Michael sits in the same booth, eating a hamburger.   About
          half of the application is now completed.
          
          
          INT. TUXEDO SHOP - NIGHT
          
          Letty and her mother sit in silence. Letty smiles at her
          mother. Her mother gives her a very tiny smile back.
          
          Michael hurries in.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
          
                              LETTY
                    I got worried. Are you OK?
          
          Michael pulls a blue polyester hat out of his pocket and puts
          it on.               M
                               ICHAEL
                    How may I help you?
          
                              LETTY
                    Congratulations.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Michael, the shop's about to close.
                    Maybe you could try on your tux.
          
          Michael heads to the dressing room in the back of the store.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Mrs. Mayer)
                    Michael just got a job.    Couldn't
                    you congratulate him?
          
                                                                   105.
          
          
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    I will, Dear. I promise.
                        (beat)
                    Why McDonald's?
          
                              LETTY
                    He's been looking everywhere for
                    weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy
                    after you've been locked away.
          
          Letty looks toward the back of the store.    Her mother looks
          at her. Letty ignores her mother.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I've read that lots of people my
                    age are supplementing their incomes
                    these days by working at McDonald's
                    and Burger King.
          
          Letty looks at her mother, tries to read her.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm going to take that as an honest
                    effort at being open minded.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Don't be fresh.
          
                              LETTY
                    Just remember that I love him.
          
          Michael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward
          the two women, bowing in Cary Grant fashion as he nears.
          
          Letty's mother turns to her daughter, who beams brightly at
          the dashing Michael.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (to Letty)
                    I'll say this, Dear.   He looks damn
                    good in a tuxedo.
          
          EXT. TRACK - DAY
          
          Letty and Michael jog.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Aunt Lily is the one who married
                    your father's cousin?
          
                              LETTY
                    No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is
                    the one who looks like a hooker.
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who
                    likes magic?
          
                              LETTY
                    You don't have to know all this by
                    Saturday. It took me years.
          
          INT. CHURCH - DAY
          
          Every inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with
          guests. Michael sits in the second row. He cranes his head
          around as "Pachelbel's Canon" RINGS OUT and the FLOWER GIRL
          L
          advances.
          
          Letty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession,
          heads down the aisle next. The bride is nowhere in sight.
          
          But even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands.
          Everyone else remains seated. They look at him. Michael
          doesn't notice. He has eyes only for Letty.
          
          Letty's mother looks at Michael with more than annoyance.
          Begrudgingly, she also stands.
          
          Following the lead, the entire church stands for Letty.    She
          smiles at Michael.
          
          INT. BALLROOM - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER
          
          A parade of guests pass through the receiving line to greet
          Mr. Mayer, Monica, Letty, Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Jake.
          
          Michael hovers close to Letty. AUNT LILY, with fluorescent
          red hair and a silver lame miniskirt, spots him.
          
                              AUNT LILY
                        (to Michael)
                    What a beautiful wedding.
          
          As she passes out of earshot,
          
                               MICHAEL
                        (to Letty)
                    Aunt Lily?
          
                              LETTY
                    Bingo.
          
          Mrs. Mayer talks to her brother CORT.
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                     Oh, and have you met Michael?    He's
                     Letty's boyfriend.
          
          Letty and Ruth overhear this. They make eye contact.   Ruth
          raises her eyebrows toward Letty. Letty smiles back.
          
          INT.   BALLROOM - LATER
          
          Ruth and Letty talk while Michael twirls across the dance
          floor with Monica.
          
                               RUTH
                     The worst was when I stammered
                     Jake's name.
          
                               LETTY
                     I don't think people even noticed.
                     I thought the ceremony was perfect.
          
                               RUTH
                     That's thanks to all your help.
          
          Cort, overweight and red from drink, approaches Ruth and
          Letty.
          
                               LETTY
                     Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock.
          
                                RUTH
                     Sorry to do this to you. But I am
                     the bride.
          
          Ruth turns and flees. CORT pounces on Letty and plants the
          wettest kiss ever on her mouth.
          
                               CORT
                         (to Letty)
                     I don't think I've seen you in two
                     or three years.
          
                               LETTY
                     Has it been that long?
          
                               CORT
                     You were with that lawyer.
          
                               LETTY
                     I'm dating Michael now.
          
                               CORT
                     Met him in the receiving line. What
                     is it that he does for a living?
          
                                                              108.
          
          
          
          Michael walks up to Letty and Cort as they speak.
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, he just got a job...

                               ICHAEL
                    In the restaurant business.
          
          Letty looks at Michael, surprised.
          
                               CORT
                    Speak of the devil.

                    How did you guys meet again?
          
                              LETTY
                    At the psych hospital.
          
                              CORT
                    I would've sent a card, but your
                    aunt and I, we weren't sure if that
                    was the thing to do.
          
                              LETTY
                    That's fine, Uncle Cort.
          
                              CORT
                        (to Michael)
                    So you were a volunteer over at the
                    hospital?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Something like that.
          
                              LETTY
                    When he could get time off from the
                    restaurant business.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to Letty)
                    How about a dance?
          
                              CORT
                    You two go ahead. I'm going to go
                    bother that pretty sister of yours
                    for a dance.
          
          Cort gives Letty another big, wet kiss.
          
                              LETTY
                    Bye, Uncle Cort.
                        (to Michael)
                    What's with the lie?
          
                                                                     109.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It wasn't exactly a lie.
          
                              LETTY
                    Pretty close.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    People at weddings don't want the
                    truth.
          
          Michael grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's not good to drink so much with
                    the medication you're on.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What's with this music? I'll go
                    talk to the D.J. and see if we
                    can't get something good going.
          
          Michael heads toward the D.J. and confers with him.    Mr.
          Mayer walks up to Letty.
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    It's good to see you so happy.
          
                              LETTY
                    Thanks, dad.
          
          Michael then walks back to Letty and pulls her out onto the
          dance floor as "Twist and Shout" BOOMS OUT from the speakers.
          
          Letty's mother departs the dance floor, grimacing. Ruth
          shoots Michael a look of pure pleasure. And everyone begins
          twisting, as we
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Completely dark.   Silent.
          
          Letty, in a nightshirt, wanders in, and stumbles through the
          room. She fumbles for the switch on the floor lamp.
          
          The light comes on, illuminating a small circle.    Just
          outside of it sits Michael.
          H
           e stares straight ahead.    Letty kneels down in front of him.
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          
                               LETTY
                    Michael?
                        (beat)
                    Michael? You should come to bed.
          
          Michael remains focused on the space directly in front of
          him.
          
                               LETTY
                    Did you take the aspirin and water?
                    You don't want to feel awful in the
                    morning.
                        (beat)
                    I'll get you some.
          
          Letty begins to stand up. The movement breaks Michael's
          trance. He pulls her back down.
          
                              LETTY
                    What is it? Are you OK?
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (strangely calm)
                    Always the drugs.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I saw you talking to my Mom.
          
                              LETTY
                    We both talked to her, Michael.
                    And your dad.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Why'd you tell her I wasn't taking
                    my meds?
          
                              LETTY
                    What do you mean not taking your
                    meds?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Why'd you tell?
          
                              LETTY
                    I didn't talk to her about
                    medications, Michael. Don't be
                    silly.
          
          Michael beats his hand on the floor.
          
                                                                     111.
          
          
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Silly?   Silly am I?
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, take it easy.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Silly, silly, silly.
          
                              LETTY
                    I think I should call someone.
          
          Michael reaches out, grabs the floor lamp, and pushes it
          over. He lurches to his feet and pulls Letty to a standing
          position.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (screaming)
                    Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you
                    upset my Mom.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, calm down. Please. It's
                    OK.
          
          Michael knocks some flowers over, then rips apart a pillow.
          
          Letty hovers in back of him.     He pauses.   She puts her hand
          on his back.
          
          Michael whirls around.   He slaps Letty's hand away. She
          stumbles backward.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, stop.
          
          He stares in her direction, but he doesn't respond.      Letty
          can't make a connection.
          
          Michael shoves his fist through a window.
          
          Letty grabs the phone.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Not my Mom. Not my silly silly
                    Mom.
          
          Letty runs with the phone. Michael follows her. Letty
          trips. She rights herself. She locks herself in the bathroom.
          
          INT. BATHROOM, MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME
          M
           ichael POUNDS on the bathroom door.     Letty dials 9-1-1.
          
                                                                    112.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I've got an emergency.    I'm at...
          
          Michael HOWLS -- a long, piercing inhuman sound.
          
                              LETTY
                    1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2.
                    My boyfriend's out of control.
          
          On the other side of the door, Michael SCREAMS.    Another
          window SHATTERS.
          
                              NEIGHBOR (OS)
                    What's going on in there?
          
                               LETTY
                        (into phone)
                    Please, please, send someone.
                        (beat)
                    No, he's having an attack. He's
                    schizophrenic...
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Letty, wearing Michael's tux jacket, is curled up on the
          floor in a fetal position.
          
          She stares...at the upset flowers, at the ripped-up pillows,
          at a fist-sized hole ripped through an unsturdy wall. Her
          gaze stops on a Spaghetti-O's can, lying empty on the floor.
          
          KNOCKS on the door.   Letty rises slowly, padding to the door
          like an old woman.
          
          The KNOCKS grow urgent.   Letty opens the door to Ruth.
          
          Letty throws herself into Ruth's waiting embrace.
          Immediately, Letty cries.
          
          After a moment, Letty steps back.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm sorry, so sorry.   I never
                    should have called.
          
          Ruth looks into Letty's eyes.
          
                              RUTH
                    You did the right thing.
          
                              LETTY
                    I ruined your wedding night.
          
                                                                  113.
          
          
          
                              RUTH
                    I'm glad you called. Now, not
                    another word about it.
          
          Ruth pulls Letty into the apartment and shuts the door behind
          them. It is only then that she sees the destruction in the
          living room. Horror flashes across her face.
          
                                 RUTH
                    Oh my God.
          
          Tears stream down Letty's face.   Ruth starts to cry.
          
                              RUTH
                    Did he hurt you?
          
          Letty shakes her head "no." Her sobbing intensifies. Ruth
          puts her arm around Letty, and together, they sit on the
          floor.
          
          Ruth holds Letty until the crying eases.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
                              R
                               UTH
                    You don't have to make any
                    decisions tonight.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what am I going to do?
          
                              RUTH
                    Do you want to go see him? I'll
                    take you if you want to go.
          
                                LETTY
                    I can't.    I can't see him there.
          
          Ruth holds her close again.
          
                               LETTY
                    I was so sure. I really thought it
                    would work.
                        (beat)
                    We have plans, Ruth.
          
                                RUTH
                    I know.    I know.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - DAY
          
          Letty sits on the same bluff she once shared with Michael.
          She smokes a cigarette, and stares out at the ocean.
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - LATER
          
          Letty remains on the bluff, crying. A priest, passing in the
          background looks over at her, and continues on his way.
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - NIGHT
          
          In the darkness, Letty lies on her back. She stares up at
          the moon and stars, bright against the night sky.
          
          EXT. BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY
          
          Letty walks along a pathway with Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    I'm glad you agreed to see me.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm just glad there aren't any hard
                    feelings.
          
                              PAUL
                    Oh, none. None. I completely
                    understand what was going on.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh.
          
                              PAUL
                    How's work going?    Are you back at
                    school?
          
                              LETTY
                    I start on Monday.
          
                              PAUL
                    So things are back on track?
          
                              LETTY
                    Getting back.
          
                              PAUL
                    I heard about your friend.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                                                                   115.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    I heard your friend was back in the
                    hospital.
          
                               LETTY
                    Michael.   Yes.
          
                              PAUL
                    I just wondered, well, if this
                    meant there was a chance for us.
                    Because I think about you a lot,
                    and I still feel...
          
                               LETTY
                    Our relationship meant a lot to me,
                    too, Paul. But it's over.
                        (beat)
                    And Michael being in the hospital
                    doesn't really change things.
          
                              PAUL
                    I think I've heard this speech
                    before.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm really sorry.
          
          Letty reaches up to hug him.    He quickly disengages himself.
                               P
                               AUL
                    I've got a deposition that I really
                    need to get cracking on, so if you
                    don't mind...
          
                              LETTY
                    Sure, I understand.
          
          Paul starts down the path.
          
                              LETTY
                    Wait. Wait.
          
          Letty runs up to Paul.
          
                              LETTY
                    I need to give you this.
          
          Letty hands Paul the engagement ring. He takes it and
          continues walking as she stares after him.
          
                                                                 116.
          
          
          
          EXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty walks up the steps to the imposing facility. We follow
          her journey through the VISITING ROOM, past families
          conversing with patients, to the NURSES' STATION.
          
          Letty walks up to Nurse Gates, who gives her a quick hug.
          John and Bill watch as Letty signs the visitors' register.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    He's in Jamie's old room.
          
          Letty walks down the HALLWAY and pauses outside Michael's
          door. She KNOCKS.
          
                               MICHAEL (OS)
                    Come in.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          Michael is in the middle of taping up the same Houdini poster
          we saw in his last room when Letty enters.
          
                               LETTY
                    Hi.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
          Letty and Michael kiss awkwardly.    Dead silence.
          
                              LETTY/MICHAEL (TOGETHER)
                    How are you?
          
          They smile nervously.
          
                              LETTY
                    I guess we need to talk.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I guess so.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's hard to know where to start.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Pretend like I'm your shrink.
          
          Letty rolls her eyes.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Sorry.   I'll be quiet.
          
                                                                   117.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I think about you all the time.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I sure know what that feels like.
          
                              LETTY
                    And all the plans we have.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yeah, the plans.
          
          Letty looks out the window.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've been thinking I could try to
                    visit you at night after work, and
                    then there'd be more time on
                    weekends to see...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Letty, please.
                              L
                                 LETTY
                    What?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Like I've told you before I don't
                    want you taking care of me.
          
                              LETTY
                    Someone has to take care of you
                    right now, Michael. You tore up
                    the apartment. You stopped taking
                    your medications.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean
                    to do that.
          
                              LETTY
                    Well then why'd it happen?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't know. I don't fucking
                    know.
          
          Letty and Michael glare at each other.    Letty looks away.
          
                                 LETTY
                    I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to
                    blame you.
          
                                                                    118.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I didn't mean for any of this to
                    happen.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, God, Michael, I know.
                        (softly)
                    Why does everything have to be so
                    hard?
          
          Michael shakes his head.
          
                              LETTY
                    What are we going to do?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What do you want to do?
          
                              LETTY
                    I know I don't want to lose you.     I
                    don't think I could stand it.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but can you stand to be with
                    me like this?
          
          Letty waits. She looks away. She turns back and stares into
          Michael's eyes. Finally, she says it.
          
                               LETTY
                    No. I can't, Michael. I'm so sorry,
                    but I just can't handle all this
                    right now.
          
          Letty starts to cry.   Tears well up in Michael's eyes.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    I know.   I can't either.
          
          Michael sits down on the bed and they hold each other.
          
                              LETTY
                    I love you so much.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I love you too, Letty.     I love you,
                    too.
          
          Letty and Michael grip each other.    Finally, they pull apart.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe we could just run away to
                    Tahiti and live on the beach.
          
                                                                 119.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That's the best idea I've heard in
                    a long time.
          
          Letty wipes a tear from Michael's cheek.
          
                              LETTY
                    Don't you have a magic trick or
                    something to make this easier?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How about something better?   Like a
                    kiss.
          T
           he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before.
          
                              LETTY
                    I can still come visit you, you
                    know.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Would that really be such a good
                    idea for either of us?
          
                              LETTY
                    Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I will. And you make sure you take
                    care of yourself.
          
          Michael puts his hand under Letty's chin and draws her head
          up so he can look into her eyes.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Promise you won't fall for any guys
                    pretending to be doctors.
          
          Letty shakes her head "no" as tears stream down her face.
          
                              LETTY
                    I guess I should go now.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You should go.
          
          Letty stands up and walks toward the door. She comes back
          and embraces Michael again. Slowly, they separate, and Letty
          leaves the room. Michael stares out the window.
          
                                                                 120.
          
          
          
          EXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          Letty walks out the door, down the steps and along the front
          walkway -- until, finally, the hospital recedes in the
          distance.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Letty sits on top of a desk. Children of all ages stare her
          down. A few familiar faces--Bobby and Jenny--grace the room.
          Principal Gail passes outside the window and glances in.
          
                               LETTY
                    First of all, I want to welcome you
                    to MathShop. I have lots of fun
                    games planned for us.
                        (beat)
                    Let's see, Bobby, can you help me
                    pass out these cards?
          
          Bobby doesn't move.
          
                              LETTY
                    Is something wrong, Bobby?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Why were you gone so long?
          
                              JENNY
                    My mom said you went crazy.
          
                              LETTY
                    I had what some people call a
                    nervous breakdown. I wasn't
                    dealing with life so well so I
                    went...
          
                              BOBBY
                    To a place for psychos.
          
                              LETTY
                    To a psychiatric institution.
                              J
                               ENNY
                    What's that?
          
                               LETTY
                    It's a place where you figure out
                    what you want, and what things in
                    your life aren't working. You
                    learn to look out for yourself and
                    not get...
          
                                                                 121.
          
          
          
          Letty trails off. She sees that she's lost the class. Bobby
          launches a spit wad that hits the boy in front of him.
          
                              LETTY
                    Let me show you the best thing I
                    learned.
          
          She walks up to Bobby. He twists around in his seat, trying
          to hide the rest of his supply of spit wads.
          
          Letty waves her hand around Bobby's head. The children,
          stare, delighted. She pulls a bright coin out of his ear,
          and hands it to him.
          
                              CHILDREN (TOGETHER)
                    Wow./ Neat./ Do it again, Miss
                    Mayer.
          
          Letty puts her hands behind her back and produces a bouquet
          of paper flowers. Now, she's got the class hooked.
          
                                                           FADE OUT
          
                                     THE END

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
the village.  One of the men recognizes him.

				WORKER
		Master Li is here!

ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.

In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.

INT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY

Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls.

				AUNT WU
		Shu Lien!

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing
for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen
wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in.

				AUNT WU
		Li Mu Bai is here!

INT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY

				LI
		How's everything?

				AUNT WU
		Fine.  Please come in.

Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in.  Li carries a
large object, wrapped in silk.

Yu smiles.

				YU
		Mu Bai...It's been too long.

				LI
		It has.
			(he glances around
			the room)
		How's business?

				YU
		Good.  And how are you?

				LI
		Fine.

An awkward pause.

				YU
		Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan
		Mountain.  He said you were
		practicing deep meditation.

				LI
		Yes.

				YU
		The mountain must be so peaceful...
		I envy you.  My work keeps me so
		busy, I hardly get any rest.

				LI
		I left the training early.

				YU
		Why?  You're a Wudan fighter.
		Training is everything.

				LI
		During my meditation training... I
		came to a place of deep silence...
		I was surrounded by light... Time
		and space disappeared.  I had come
		to a place my master had never told
		me about.

				YU
		You were enlightened?

				LI
		No.  I didn't feel the bliss of
		enlightenment.  Instead... I was
		surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I
		couldn't bear it.  I broke off my
		meditation.  I couldn't go on.
		There was something... pulling me
		back.

				YU
		What was it?

				LI
		Something I can't let go of.  You
		are leaving soon?

				YU
		We're preparing a convoy for a
		delivery to Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
		something to Sir Te for me.

Li unwraps the object.  It is an ancient, astonishingly
beautiful sword.

				YU
		The Green Destiny Sword?  You're
		giving it to Sir Te?

				LI
		I am.  He has always been our
		greatest protector.

				YU
		I don't understand.  How can you
		part with it?  It has always been
		with you.

				LI
		Too many men have died at its edge.
		It only looks pure because blood
		washes so easily from its blade.

				YU
		You use it justly, you're worthy of
		it.

				LI
		It's time for me to leave it behind.

				YU
		So what will you do now?

Li doesn't reply.

				YU
		Come with me to Peking.  You can
		give the sword to Sir Te yourself.
		It'll be just like old times.

				LI
		First I must visit my master's
		grave.  It's been many years since
		Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet
		to avenge his death.  And yet I'm
		thinking of quitting.  I must pray
		for his forgiveness.

				YU
		Join me once you have finished.  I
		can wait for you in Peking.

				LI
		Perhaps.

EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY

Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
boundaries of Peking.  Yu, riding a handsome horse and
clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.

				GUARDS
		Ok.  Pass.

				YU
		Thanks.  Let's go into the city.

EXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY

Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
medicinal herbs.

				GIAO
		Everything got here safely.  I'm
		much obliged.

				YU
		Just doing my job.

				GIAO
		Sun Security has been the best
		since your father started it.
		You're a credit to his memory.

				YU
		Thank you.

				GIAO
		I mean it.

EXT. DAY. PEKING

From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
the morning sun.

EXT. PEKING STREET. DAY

Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
are fighting to get through the boulevards.

A group of jugglers perform at a corner.

Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Yu presents the sword to Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		This is Li's personal sword, a
		great hero's weapon!  He is the
		only one in the world worthy of
		carrying it.  It's too fine a gift.
		I cannot accept it.

				YU
		Sir Te!  It has brought him as much
		trouble as glory.  Help him to
		leave these troubles behind.
		Otherwise, he'll never be able to
		start anew.

				SIR TE
		All right.  I'll act as the sword's
		custodian.

De Lu, the head servant, enters.

				DE LU
		Governor Yu has arrived.

				SIR TE
		I must change.

				YU
			(getting up)
		You've always been so good to Li Mu
		Bai and me.  Please accept our
		thanks.

				SIR TE
		Please do not be such a stranger.
		You'll stay the night as my guest.
		Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.
		And forgive me for prying.  Your
		father was a great friend to me,
		and I think of you as my own
		daughter.

				YU
		Please, Sir Te, what is it?

				SIR TE
		Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and
		his warrior days... maybe he's
		trying to tell you something?

				YU
		I don't know...

				SIR TE
		Don't be coy.  I've always known
		about your feelings for each other.
		All these years, it's a shame...
		neither of you is brave enough to
		admit the truth to the other.
		You're both wasting precious time.

				YU
		I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I
		aren't cowards.

				SIR TE
		When it comes to emotions, even
		great heroes can be idiots.  Tell
		me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
		the next time you see him.  I'll
		give him an earful!

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu and De Lu approach the study.

				DE LU
		Sir Te said to leave the sword in
		here.

De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
inside.  The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
hanging on the walls.

				DE LU
		Who are you?

				JEN
		I'm your guest today.  I am Governor
		Yu's daughter.

				DE LU
		This is Sir Te's study.  You are
		here to...

				JEN
		I was looking for a quiet corner.

				DE LU
		I am Sir Te's head servant.  And
		this is another of our guests.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.

				JEN
		It's heavy for such a thin piece of
		metal!

				YU
		The handle is heavy.  And the blade
		is no ordinary metal.  Still, the
		sword is the lightest of weapons.
		You're just not used to handling it.

				JEN
		But I have had much practice.  As a
		child in the West, a platoon lived
		with us.  They'd let me play with
		their weapons.  The scabbard is so
		beautiful.

				YU
		Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you
		see it tainted with blood, its
		beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400
		years old.

				JEN
		Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...

				YU
		My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it
		to Sir Te as a gift.

				JEN
		Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?
		Why would he give his sword to Sir
		Te?

				YU
		You're too young to understand.

				JEN
		You're a sword fighter too?

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath.  An eerie sound
resonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed.

				YU
		Yes, I am.  But I prefer the
		machete.  Certain moves, however,
		call for a sword.

				JEN
		Really?

Yu puts the sword back in the case.

				JEN
			(longingly)
		It must be exciting to be a fighter,
		to be totally free!

				YU
		Fighters have rules too: friendship,
		trust, integrity... Without rules,
		we wouldn't survive for long.

				JEN
		I've read all about people like you.
		Roaming wild, beating up anyone who
		gets in your way!

				YU
		Writers wouldn't sell many books if
		they told how it really is.

				JEN
		But you're just like the characters
		in the stories.

				YU
		Sure.  No place to bathe for days,
		sleeping in flea-infested beds...
		They tell you all about that in
		those books?

				JEN
		You know what I mean.  I'm getting
		married soon, but I haven't lived
		the life I want.

				YU
		So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's
		the most important step in a
		woman's life, isn't it?

				JEN
		You're not married, are you?

				YU
		What do you think?

				JEN
		No!  You couldn't roam around
		freely if you were.

				YU
		You're probably right.

Yu studies Jen.  The room falls silent for a moment.

EXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY

It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.  Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid.  She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye.  Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.

EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Two lighted lanterns are raised up.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.

				SIR TE
		Go ahead, Governor Yu.

Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword.  He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.
Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword
out from its sheath.  The sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark.

				SIR TE
		Two feet 9 inches long.  1 inch
		wide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,
		2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of
		an inch thick.  With seven rubies
		missing from the hilt.  You can
		tell the design dates back to
		before the Chin era.  Engraved with
		a technique lost by the time of the
		Han Dynasty.

				GOVERNOR YU
		Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		A sword by itself rules nothing.
		It comes alive only through skillful
		manipulation.

				GOVERNOR YU
		I see your point.  Please continue.

				SIR TE
		The Imperial Court isn't the
		problem.  With royalty and officials
		everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
		security tight.  But Peking is not
		like the West.  Here, you'll find
		all sorts of characters.  Proceed
		with caution in your quest for law
		and order.  Don't depend only on
		the court.  Contacts in the Giang
		Hu underworld can ensure your
		position.  Be strong, yet supple.
		This is the way to rule.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then
walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings.  Someone
knocks and the maid goes to answer the door.

				MAID
		Governess...

				GOVERNESS
		Let me do it.

The maid leaves as the governess enters the room.

				JEN
		Please sit.

				GOVERNESS
		I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you
		want to change into them?

				JEN
		Put them down.

				GOVERNESS
		I heard you met Shu Lien today.

				JEN
		Do you know her?

				GOVERNESS
		She's one of those.  Your mother
		would not want you consorting with
		her kind.

Jen shoots her an angry look.

				JEN
		I'll socialize with whomever I
		please.

				GOVERNESS
		Don't invite danger into your
		father's house.

She's about to say something, then thinks better of it.

				JEN
		I'm tired now.

				GOVERNESS
		Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up,
		and is getting married soon.  God
		knows what the future will bring.

				JEN
		It will be just the same.  Enough!
		I'm tired.

				GOVERNESS
		Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the
		windows for you.

The governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed,
thinking.

EXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

A wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo,
Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene.

				MASTER BO
		Chilly, eh?

				NIGHTMAN
		Yes, Master Bo.

As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.

EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
wraps the sword.

Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The
thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to
stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
roof as Bo yells out.

				BO
		Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on
		the roof!  The sword's been stolen!
		Stop thief!  Stop him!

The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.

Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
people to the theft.  People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
them.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

Bo runs through the streets.  The thief is nowhere in sight.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.  Bo hurries
towards the source.

EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.

				TSAI
		It's Jade Fox!

				MAY
		We must avenge mother!

The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
a wall, just as Bo arrives.

				BO
		Do something!  He's getting away!

EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.  Yu and the
hooded figure face off.

				YU
		Return the sword, and I'll let you
		go.

The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.

Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.

				YU
		You've been trained at Wudan?

The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.  Yu
catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
of lightning-quick blows.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.

				TSAI
		You're mistaken.  We're just street
		performers.  We were rehearsing.

				MAY
		Father!

				BO
		You were rehearsing?  Who are you
		trying to fool?

May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.  They run
off.

				BO
		Where did that thief go?

Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
Governor Yu's compound.

				BO
		Governor Yu's house!

EXT. ROOF TOP

Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.

				YU
		Get down here!  Give back the sword!

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT

Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
to get away.

Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
empty courtyard.

EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.

				DE LU
		Sir Te awaits you.

INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY

Men are standing at attention.  Bo is giving his account of
what happened, as Yu enters.

				BO
		I'm sure the thief is in the Yu
		household.

				SIR TE
		How dare you imply?

				BO
		But I say --

				SIR TE
		-- Enough.

The men hustle out.  Bo can barely contain his frustration.

				YU
		Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

				SIR TE
		Yes, though I doubt he's involved
		in this.

				YU
		But the sword could be in his
		compound.

				SIR TE
		Then someone's trying to set him up.
		We should inform Li Mu Bai.

EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Madam Yu is returning from temple.  The governess is helping
her out of the carriage.  Servants are peeling bills off a
wall across the street.

				MADAM YU
		What is it?

				MAID
		Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
escape justice!" is seen on the ground.

				MADAM YU
		Let me see.

				GOVERNESS
		Someone is after Jade Fox.
		Preposterous, looking for her here!

Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
flyer away and follows her.

A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu.  She studies it,
then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Bo is searching for the Tsais.  The bridge is full of
jugglers.  But the two are nowhere to be found.

EXT. PEKING STREET - DAY

Bo quizzes a homeless man.

				BO
		Where are they?

				HOMELESS MAN
		I don't know.  I haven't seen them
		in two days.

Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
quickly into an alley.  Bo follows her.

EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE

May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
down bamboo fence.  Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
oiling their weapons.

INT. BO'S ROOM - DAY

Jen practices calligraphy.  The governess is by her side
embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen.  The
maid enters.

				MAID
		There is a Miss Shu Lien here to
		see you.

Jen stops and looks up at them.

				GOVERNESS
		Miss is busy right now.

				MAID
		I'll tell her.

				JEN
		Show her in.

The governess shoots her a look.

				GOVERNESS
		This spells trouble.

				JEN
		I have a guest.

The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in.

				MAID
		This way please.

The governess and Yu exchange quick glances.  The governess
bows slightly and departs.

				JEN
		I've missed you.

				YU
		How so?

				JEN
		I'm bored.

Yu sees the calligraphy.

				YU
		You're doing calligraphy?

				JEN
		I'll write your name.  Just for fun.

Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness.

				YU
		I never realized my name looks like
		"sword."

Jen freezes slightly.

				YU
		You write gracefully.  Calligraphy
		is so similar to fencing.

				JEN
		Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

The maid enters with tea.

				JEN
		Please.

				YU
		Thank you for seeing me.  I hear
		your wedding day is near.  You must
		be overwhelmed by the preparations.

				JEN
		I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less
		I think of it the better.  My
		parents are arranging everything.
		The Gous are a very powerful family.
		My marrying one will be good for my
		father's career.

				YU
		You are fornuate to marry into such
		a noble family.

				JEN
		Am I?  I wish I were like the
		heroes in the books I read.  Like
		you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm
		happy to be marrying.  But to be
		free to live my own life, to choose
		whom I love... That is true
		happiness.

				YU
		Do you think so?  Let me tell you a
		story.

				JEN
		About you and Li Mu Bai?

				YU
		Yes.  Did you know I was once
		engaged to be married?

				JEN
		No, really?

				YU
		His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was
		a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
		One day, while in battle, he was
		killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
		enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went
		through a lot together.  Our
		feelings for each other grew
		stronger.  But how could we dishonor
		Meng's memory?  So the freedom you
		talk about, I too desire it.  But I
		have never tasted it.

				JEN
		Too bad for Meng, but it's not your
		fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

				YU
		I am not an aristocrat, as you
		are... but I must still respect a
		woman's duties.

				JEN
		Don't distance us.  From now on,
		let's be like sisters.

				YU
		Then as a sister, let me wish you
		happiness in your marriage.

EXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY

The maid escorts Yu out.  Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
corner.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly
from bed and looks out the window.  A light breeze stirs her
hair.  The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face
dissolves, into...

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.  She sits in
a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
that is traveling through the spectacular desert.  Across
from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.

				MADAM YU
		What a godforsaken place!  Can't
		your father be appointed closer to
		civilization?  Jen... are you
		listening to me?

Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
beautiful mountainside.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
tree, watching Jen.

				TSAI
		Let's go!

They drop down silently and walk away.  From another rooftop,
Lo looks silently on.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tsai and May enter the house.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going
through their belongings.

Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's
mask -- revealing Bo.  Tsai has another long knife at his
throat.

				TSAI
		Who are you?

				BO
		Wait!  I'm a friend!

Tsai pauses.

INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling
pot of vegetable and meatball soup.  Her father and Bo are
now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight.

				TSAI
		I don't care about your sword.

				BO
		Why were you spying on the Yus?

				TSAI
		I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.
		I'm a police inspector from Shaan
		Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a
		master criminal.  I hear she
		infiltrated the Yus.  She must have
		come with them when they transferred
		here.  But with Yu's reputation, I
		can't just go in and accuse her.

				BO
		This Jade Fox is a woman?

				TSAI
		Yes.

				BO
		Then leave her to me.

				TSAI
		Pardon me, but I doubt you can
		handle her.  My wife was quite a
		martial arts expert.  Jade Fox
		killed her.  So you see, this is
		personal.  Leave her to me.

				MAY
		It's ready!
			(re: the soup)


				BO
		I'm ready for anything!

Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks.  May intercepts
him with her own chopsticks.

				MAY
		Father gets first dip.

Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a
meatball but to catch an incoming dart.  A dart wrapped with
a note.  Bo jumps up.

				TSAI
		They're gone.

				MAY
		What does it say?

				TSAI
		"We'll settle this at midnight on
		Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out
		of her hole.

INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to
another man, whose back is to her.

				SIR TE
		Shu Lien, look who's here.

The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai.

EXT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.

				LI
		Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
		suspicion on Governor Yu.

				YU
		But something is going on at the Yu
		household.

				LI
		What have you discovered?

From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer.  Li takes it, his
face darkening.

				LI
		Jade Fox?  Impossible.

				YU
		You always suspected she'd fled to
		the West.

				LI
		I didn't think she'd dare come back
		to Peking!

				YU
		Is there any place safer than under
		the nose of Governor Yu?

				LI
		So I shall avenge my master's death
		after all.

				YU
		Be careful.  Sir Te requires
		discretion.  Official business is
		difficult enough.  Don't let
		personal feelings make it worse.
		And I don't know... even this
		poster... could be some sort of trap.

				LI
		Did you see who posted it?

Yu pauses.

				YU
		No.

				LI
		It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
		On the night of the theft there was
		a brawl near Yu's.  Were you
		involved?

				YU
		It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he
		followed the thief to the Yus'.

				LI
		Have you questioned him yet?

				YU
		No, not yet...

				LI
		But your men are watching over Yu's
		compund?

				YU
		No, I'd already sent them home.
		You can blame me for losing the
		sword, but please trust that I'll
		get it back soon using my own
		methods.

				LI
		That's not what I meant.  I don't
		care about the sword.

				YU
		What do you mean?  Didn't you come
		back here for it?

				LI
		I don't know it was stolen until I
		got here.

				YU
		Then, why did you come?

				LI
		Well, we had talked...

De Lu enters.

				DE LU
		Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li,
		your room is ready.

				LI
		Thank you.  Please lead the way.

EXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT

Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.  Bo stifles a
yawn.

				BO
		The fox doesn't care much for
		punctuality.  Still no sign of her.

An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
her face, holding a cane.  The three exchange glances.

				TSAI
		Enough!  Show yourself.

The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.

				FOX
		Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for
		your stubbornness.

				BO
		That's what you think, old witch!

				TSAI
		If you surrender now, you'll suffer
		less.  But if you resist, I won't
		stop until you're dead.

				MAY
		Father!  Let me avenge my mother's
		death.

				FOX
		You'll soon end up like her, you
		little whore!

				BO
		You'll pay for that!

A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
the opportunity presents itself.

				TSAI
			(to Bo)
		She's going to paralyze you!

Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo.  May shoots an arrow at
her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.

				TSAI
		May!

Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.

				FOX
		Tsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!

				MAY
		Father, are you all right?

Li addresses Fox.

				LI
		Wudan should have gotten rid of you
		long ago.  It's been a long time,
		Jade Fox!  You don't remember me...
		But you should remember my master.
		You infiltrated Wudan while I was
		away.  You stole our master!  Now
		it's time for you to pay!

				FOX
		Your master underestimated us women.
		Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
		would never teach me.  He deserved
		to die by a woman's hand!

				LI
		You stole the secrets of Wudan's
		highest martial arts.  But after
		ten years of training, your moves
		are still undisciplined.  And
		today, under a Wudan sword... you
		will die!

Li easily brings Fox to the ground.

Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox.  A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.

				FOX
		Disciple, we'll kill them all!

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				BO
		Another one!

				FOX
		I must get rid of Tsai!

Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
figure.

				LI
		Who are you?  Why is the Green
		Destiny in your possession?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		What's it to you?

				LI
		My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green
		Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be
		your master.  Where did you learn
		that "Xuan Piu" move?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		I'm just playing around.

				LI
		Tell me, who is your master?

				FIGURE IN BLACK
		Let's go!

				FOX
		We must kill them!

Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
back, hitting him in the head.  Fox and the masked figure
leap away.

May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
Bo kneels beside her.

				MAY
		Father!

EXT. TE'S - DAY

Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them.

				TE
		This is Tsai?

				MAY
		My father.  Police Inspector from
		Shaan.

				TE
		This should be reported to Governor
		Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You
		believe the killer is hiding out in
		his compound.

				YU
		I'd bet my life on it!

				TE
			(to Li and Yu)
		Come with me.

He exits the room.

INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY

Te, Li, and Yu are seated.

				SIR TE
		This needs to be resolved, and
		quickly.

				LI
		I'll get into the Yu household and
		get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and
		her gang.

				YU
		We must be careful.  Governor Yu is
		a court official, and in charge of
		security.  Any disturbance will
		cast suspicion on him.  It might
		get Sir Te in trouble.

				SIR TE
		This is a delicate matter.

				YU
		Sir Te, can you find some excuse to
		invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

				SIR TE
		What do you have in mind?

				YU
		The best way to trap a fox is
		through her cubs.

Sir Te and Li look puzzled.

EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY

Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau.

				MADAM YU
		Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
		with these wedding gifts.  She's
		being so considerate.

				YU
		I'm sorry she's not feeling well
		enough to receive you today.

				MADAM YU
		I heard Sir Te lost something.  And
		now Madame Te's not feeling well...

Jen sits silently reading.

				YU
		We know who stole the missing item.
		If the thief returns it, I'm sure
		Sir Te will pursue the matter no
		further.

				MADAM YU
		That's good.  Sometimes the help
		can't keep their hands to themselves.
		It's very embarassing.

				YU
		Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
		people can make mistakes... that
		can bring ruin to themselves and
		their families.

				MADAM YU
		But don't be too lenient.

				YU
		No mercy will be shown toward the
		murderer who turned up in Peking.

				MADAM YU
		A murderer?

				YU
		Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu
		Bai's own master.  Last night, she
		killed a policeman who had tracked
		her down.

				MADAM YU
		A female criminal!  Now that's news!

Jen becomes visibly upset.

				JEN
		You say she killed a policeman?

				YU
		Yes, from the West.  He went
		undercover and and followed her
		here,

				MADAM YU
		Maybe the murderer and the thief
		are one and the same.

				YU
		I doubt it.  This thief... it very
		unusual...

As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
pot slips from her hand.  Without even looking down, Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.

				YU
		...And most likely smarter than a
		mere killer.

Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.

				JEN
			(formal)
		Greetings, Sir Te.

				SIR TE
		Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu
		Bai, the renowned swordsman.

				LI
		Delighted to meet you.

Li sizes Jen up.

				TE
		Miss Yu is soon to be married.

				LI
		Congratulations.

EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.

				MAY
		Why don't you come in?

				BO
		I'm standing guard.

				MAY
		Come in.  It's cold.

She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.

				MAY
		Come in.  We don't have to fear
		Jade Fox if we're together.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A still, dark night.

EXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT

Something moves in the moonlight.  A hooded figure jumps down.

Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.

				LI
		Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
		You've brought me the sword?

				FIGURE
		I do as I please.

The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.

				LI
		Where's your master?

				FIGURE
		What's it to you?

The figure floats away.  Li chases after her.

EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT

The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
displaying amazing floating skills.

INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure bounces into an old monastery.  Li is already
there.

				LI
		Had enough flying?  You've got
		potential.  You've studied the
		Wudan Manual but you don't
		understand it.  You need a real
		master.

The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her
eyes.

				FIGURE
		Do you think you are a real master?

				LI
		Like most things, I am nothing.
		It's the same for this sword.  All
		of it is simply a state of mind.

				FIGURE
		Stop talking like a monk!  Just
		fight!

				LI
		Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

				FIGURE
		On guard!

				LI
		Real sharpness comes without effort.

EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
her.

The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.

The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly.  Li gets even
more elusive, using a branch to repel her.

				LI
		No growth without assistant.  No
		action without reaction.  No desire
		without restraint.  Now give
		yourself up and find yourself again.
		There is a lesson for you.

Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
slightly.

				FIGURE
		Go ahead.

				LI
		Why should I?  You need practice.
		I can teach you to fight with the
		Green Destiny, but first you must
		learn to hold it in stillness.

				FIGURE
		Why do you want to teach me?

				LI
		I've always wanted a disciple
		worthy of Wudan's secrets.

				FIGURE
		And if I use them to kill you?

				LI
		That's a risk I'm willing to take.
		Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade
		Fox couldn't corrupt you.

The figure's eyes cloud with tears.

				FIGURE
		Wudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your
		lessons!

The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
alone in the monastery.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen slips in through the window.  She pulls off her mask, as
she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing.

				FOX
		You're home late... or should I say
		early?

				JEN
		Why are you still here?  You killed
		a policeman.  You should leave!
		You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

				FOX
		They wouldn't have found me if you
		hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a
		little girl, you thought stealing
		would be fun?  You, too, are
		responsible for that death.  Come
		with me.  You don't want to waste
		your life as the wife of some
		bureaucrat.  Denied your talent...
		As a master and disciple we will
		rule.

				JEN
		I'll never live as a thief!

				FOX
		You're already a thief.

				JEN
		That was just for fun.  How can I
		leave?  Where would I go?

				FOX
		Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of
		anyone in our way.  Even your father.

				JEN
		Shut up!

				FOX
		It's the Giang Hu fighter
		lifestyle... kill or be killed.
		Exciting, isn't it?

				JEN
		I owe you nothing.

				FOX
		Yes, you do!  You are still my
		disciple.

Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few
blows.  Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's
pressure points, disabling her.  Jen pushes her across the
room.

				JEN
		You think you've been teaching me
		all these years from the manual?
		You couldn't even decipher the
		symbols!

				FOX
		I studied the diagrams.  But you
		hid the details!

				JEN
		You wouldn't have understood, even
		if I had tried to explain.  You
		know... you've gone as far as you
		can go.  I hid my skills so as not
		to hurt you.

				FOX
		If I hadn't seen you fight with Li
		Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
		all you've hidden from me.

				JEN
		Master... I started learning from
		you in secret when I was 10.  You
		enchanted me with the world of
		Giang Hu.  But once I realized I
		could surpass you, I became so
		frightened!  Everything fell apart.
		I had no one to guide me, no one to
		learn from.

				FOX
		Believe me, I've a lesson or two
		left to teach you!

Fox exits.

EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY

The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.

EXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY

Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
at ease with the weapon.  He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway.

				YU
		The sword is back... are you happy?

Li smiles.

				LI
		I admit, getting it back makes me
		realize how much I'd missed it.

				YU
		But it's not your sword anymore.
		You gave it to Sir Te.

				LI
		True.  But I must borrow it for one
		last mission.  Jade Fox must die at
		its edge.  Did you know what you
		were hiding when you covered for
		that girl?

				YU
		My job was to get the sword back,
		without embarassing anyone.  I
		wasn't about to ruin her life, or
		her father's.

				LI
		You did your job well.  But, this
		girl... I saw her last night.

				YU
		I knew she would intrigue you.

				LI
		She needs direction... and training.

				YU
		She's an aristocrat's daughter.
		She's not one of us.  In any case,
		it will all be over soon.  You'll
		kill Fox, and she'll marry.

				LI
		That's not for her.  She should
		come to Wudan and become a disciple.

				YU
		But Wudan does not accept women.

				LI
		For her, they might make an
		exception.  If not, I'm afraid
		she'll become a poisoned dragon.

				YU
		It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan
		accepts her, her husband might
		object.

				LI
		I thought by giving away the sword,
		I could escape the Giang Hu world.
		But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

				YU
		I wish there were something more I
		could do to help you.

				LI
		Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jen is asleep.  A noise awakens her.

Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of
Jen's waiting sword.

Jen's sword drops to the ground.

				JEN
		Lo?

				LO
		Jen!

Lo grabs her by the wrist.

				JEN
		You shouldn't have come.

				LO
		With all the traffic on your
		rooftop these days... it took me a
		while to get in here.  I can't wait
		any longer.  I was wrong to let you
		go.  Come back with me.  You'll be
		happy in the desert.  You'll be
		free there.

Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms
again.

				JEN
		You've been looking for me all this
		time?

FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER

INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen
admires the piece, her most prized possession.

Madam Yu sits opposite her.

				MADAM YU
		Jen... stop playing with it.

Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens.

				JEN
		I won't break it.

EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY

Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.

				GUARD A
		It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is
		coming!

His warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.

				MADAM YU
		Lower the shade, don't let them see
		you!

				DARK CLOUD (LO)
		Don't touch the women!

Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.

She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
flails beside him.

She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback.

				LO
		Let's go!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.

				LO
		Come get your comb.

She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse.

				LO
		Hurry back to your mother.

Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.

EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY

A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
keeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as
she dismounts.

One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
feet away.

In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face.  He crumples to the sand.

The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
and charge her at once.

In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back.

Lo calls out and stops the fight.

				LO
		She's mine.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
20 feet apart.  Their pace has slowed considerably.  In
fact, they're dead tired.

				LO
		Let's stop a moment.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LO
			(shouting a bit)
		You're tired.  You need rest.  Your
		horse needs water.  There's a creek
		up here.

He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.

				LO
		Well, there used to be!  What's
		your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call
		me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall
		or big, but I'm quick as lightning.

				JEN
		My comb!

She kicks him.  They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
collapses.  She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.

INT. CAVE - DAY

Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur.  She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.
Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her
are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp
arrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows.

				LO
		If you like that arrow, I can make
		you a bow.  Great for hunting wild
		chicken.  They're delicious.

Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but
her legs betray her and she falls.

				LO
		You need to eat, understand?  Then
		you'll have the strength to fight.
		Understand?

He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.
He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts
grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she
starts to wolf it down.

				LO
		You're eating too fast.  Slowly.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.  A chicken
roasts over a fire.  Lo whistles.

Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY

Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
But soon she passes out.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen again awakes inside the cave.  Lo tries to feed her some
water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up.

				LO
		You've got quite a temper.  It's
		better this way.

				JEN
		You coward!

				LO
		Still in a bad mood?  At least
		you're speaking.  What's your name?

Jen spits at Lo.

				LO
		I didn't think the Hans had names
		like that.

Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the
flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.

Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.

He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her.

				LO
		Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would
		already have done it.  You must be
		dying for a bath.  Fresh water's
		hard to get here.  But I managed to
		bring some up.  You can wear my
		clothes when you're done.  They're
		clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so
		you'll know where I am.  After the
		bath, you'll be calmer.

Jen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as
he walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.
While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud
rendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember
all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few
passages.  Jen smiles.

INT. CAVE - NIGHT

Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet.

				LO
		No more hitting on the head!  All
		this trouble for a comb?

				JEN
		It's mine.  It means a lot to me.
		A barbarian like you wouldn't
		understand.

				LO
		Not true.  I can use it to pick
		fleas from my horse.

				JEN
		By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

				LO
		I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I
		though you were a Han.

				JEN
		Give me back my comb.

				LO
		I don't take orders from anyone.

				JEN
		Give it back.

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a
little blood from his chest.  Furious, Lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly.  Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay.  Violence turns
into unleashed passion.

EXT. DESERT OASIS - DAY

Lo and Jen ride across the desert.  Jen holds tightly to him.

EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.

				LO
		When I was a boy, one night, I saw
		a thousand shooting stars.  I
		thought, where did they all go?
		I'm an orphan.  I used to look for
		stars alone.  I thought if I rode
		to the other end of the desert, I'd
		find them.  I've been riding in the
		desert ever since.

				JEN
		And so, the little boy became a
		fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find
		the stars, so he stole my comb.

Lo pauses.

				LO
		Out here, you always fight for
		survival.  You have to be part of a
		gang to stand a chance.  Slowly,
		your gang becomes your family.  All
		that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
		scare people and make my life easier.

				JEN
		So you're still that little boy
		looking for shooting stars.

				LO
		I am a man.  And now I've found the
		brightest star of all.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.

				LO
		Your father's men are looking for
		you.

Jen doesn't respond.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY

Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over,
viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.

				LO
		Your father's men are still looking
		for you.  They're still out there,
		circling closer.

				JEN
		Let them look.

				LO
		It is trouble for me.

Jen bites her lip.

				JEN
		Don't send me back!

				LO
		You must decide.  You might get
		tired of this life.  You might
		begin to miss your family.  If it
		were our daughter, we'd look for
		her too.  She would miss us.  Jen...
		I want you to be mine forever.  I
		will make my mark on the world.  I
		will earn your parents' respect.
		We have a legend.  Anyone who dares
		to jump from the mountain, God will
		grant his wish.  Long ago, a young
		man's parents were ill, so he
		jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't
		even hurt.  He floated away, far
		away, never to return.  He knew his
		wish had come true.  If you believe,
		it will happen.  The elders say, "A
		faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

INT. TENT - DAY

Jen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They
embrace.

				JEN
		Keep it safe.  Return it to me when
		we are together again.

				LO
		I will.

				JEN
			(smiling painfully)
		If you don't, I'll come after you.
		And I won't let you off so easy.

EXT. TENT - DAY

Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
light.

End of flashback.

INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

				LO
		Wherever I went, someone always
		recognized me.  I really tried.
		Later, I heard you came to Peking.
		I was afraid I'd never see you
		again.  So I came.  I can't let you
		marry.

Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from
outside the door.

				JEN
			(whispering)
		Go.

				LO
		Jen...

				JEN
			(through her tears)
		Don't ever come back.

Lo hovers at the window frame.

				LO
		So it's over?

Jen pauses.

				JEN
		Yes.

Lo thrusts a small object in her hand.

He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of
sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall.

				MAID
		We heard noises.

				JEN
		It was just a cat.

The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door.

Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo
has given her.

EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

The noise and color of a wedding procession.  A marching
band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
handsome white horse.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides
silently in the bride's carriage.

EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY

Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
gate.

				YU
		You think Jade Fox will show up?

				LI
		She's out there, but I doubt she'll
		show herself.  We'll keep our eyes
		open.  Sooner or later, she'll come
		for the girl.

INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY

A small arrow flies into the carriage.  Jen calmly lifts the
red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the
panelling inside the carriage.

We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen
doesn't seem to notice.

				LO
			(v.o.)
		Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine!

Lo runs wildly into the crowd.

				LO
		Come with me to the desert!  Jen!
		Come with me to Xin Jiang!

The guards surround Lo, but he escapes.

EXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY

Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
pressed against Lo's neck.  Yu comes running around the
corner and sees them.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		Come with me!  Hurry!

INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who
look him over.

				YU
			(to Lo)
		You thought she'd give it all up
		and go back West with you?

				LO
		She's mine.

				LI
		Either way, you are no good to her
		dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans
		hunting you, you'll soon be in
		their hands.

				LO
		I don't care anymore.

				LI
		If you truly loved her, you wouldn't
		say that.

				YU
		Don't you want to see her again.

				LI
		All right.  I'll write you an
		introduction.  Take it to Wudan.
		Wait there for news from me.

				LO
		All right.

EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
compound, a sense of panic in the air.  Yu gives Li a look.
Li shrugs.

INT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT

A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty
sword case, his voice rising.

				SIR TE
		When will this end?  They take it,
		they put it back, they take it
		again.  My home is turning into a
		warehouse.

Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te.

				TE
		Speak!

				BO
		Jen has run away!  Gou found the
		wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu
		requests your assistance.  You know
		the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants
		to find her, and keep her from harm.

				LI
		Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't
		worry.

INT. TEA STALL - DAY

Jen arrives at the tea stall.  She places her sword on the
table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu
martial arts characters sitting nearby.

				WAITRESS
		What can I serve you?

As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm.

				JEN
		The cup is dirty.

The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away.
The men approach Jen.

				GANGSTER A
		Hello.  What is your name?

				JEN
			(without lifting her eyes)
		Long.

				GANGSTER B
		It's young Master Long.  My
		apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
		this is my brother in arms, Flying
		Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to
		Huai An, and where are you headed,
		Master Long?

				JEN
		Anywhere there's action.

The two men exchange glances.

				GANGSTER A
		In that case, perhaps we could be
		of assistance.

				JEN
		Don't bother.

				GANGSTER A
		You don't seem to understand.

				JEN
		So what if I don't?

				GANGSTER B
		We have ways of helping you
		understand.

The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped
into scraps by Jen.

				GANGSTER A
			(stunned)
		Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

				JEN
		He is my defeated foe!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
horses in the background.

				YU
		Have some tea.

As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
Embarrassed, Li pulls back.

				LI
		Shu Lien... The things we touch
		have no permanence.  My master
		would say... there is nothing we
		can hold on to in this world.  Only
		by letting go can we truly possess
		what is real.

				YU
		Not everything is an illusion.  My
		hand... wasn't that real?

				LI
		Your hand, rough and callused from
		machete practice... All this time,
		I've never had the courage to touch
		it.

Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.

				LI
		Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
		dragons, full of corruption... I
		tried sincerely to give it up but I
		have brought us only trouble.

				YU
		To repress one's feelings only
		makes them stronger.

				LI
		You're right, but I don't know what
		to do.  I want to be with you...
		just like this.  It gives me a
		sense of peace.

Li Mu Bai smiles.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Jen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her.

				WAITER
		Please follow me.

				JEN
		I want a clean room.

				WAITER
		We have plenty.  Your order?

Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down.

				JEN
		Steamed whole cod, bite-size
		meatballs, a little starchy, but
		keep the sauce light, shark fin
		soup, mixed vegetables, and some
		warm wine.

				WAITER
			(dazed)
		I have to order from a bigger
		restaurant.

				JEN
		Hurry then.

The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to
place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not
much money left.

A large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey
the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs.

				GIANG HU A
		That's him.

				MI BIAO
		I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true
		master has arrived.  I have come to
		seek a lesson.

Jen ignores him.

				MI BIAO
			(bristles)
		You asked for it!

Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea.
Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at
a sensitive pressure point.  This provokes a reaction from
the other men.

				JEN
		What kind of Iron Arm are you?

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		You have amazing technique!  I am
		Flying Machete.  Are you related to
		Southern Crane?

				JEN
		Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything
		with two feet.  Who could remember
		such long-winded names?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
		you don't know his master, Southern
		Crane?

				JEN
		Who are you?

				GOU JUN SIHUNG
		I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

				JEN
			(furious)
		Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes
		me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.
		You'll be the first to feel my
		sword today.

Jen leaps up and dives into battle.  The men all use
different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the
powerful Green Destiny.

				MONK JING
		Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?

				JEN
		A monk, in a place like this?  You
		need a lesson!

				MONK JING
		Who are you?

She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing
the Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Who am I?  I am... I am the
		Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed
		with the Incredible... Green
		Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern
		Crane... lower your head... and ask
		for mercy.  I am the desert dragon.
		I leave no trace.  Today I fly over
		Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over
		Wudan Mountain!

Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks.

INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who
battled with Jen.

				FLYING MACHETE CHANG
		We politely asked for a friendly
		match, but she showed no respect,
		and attacked us.  Everyone came by
		to teach her a lesson.

				MI BIAO
		Her sword was just too powerful.

				MONK JING
		I've traveled everywhere, but never
		met anyone so uncivilized.

				SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD
			(heavily bandaged)
		She kept accusing me of being Gou
		Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this
		Gou, anyway?

				YU
		Her husband.

The men all nod their heads.

EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY

Li and Yu ride together.

				LI
			(to Yu)
		We're close to your headquarters.
		Go home and check in.

				YU
		What about you?

				LI
		I'll look around and catch up later.

				YU
		Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get
		a good night's sleep at headquarters.

Yu takes a fork off the road.  Thunder can be heard in the
darkening sky.

EXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY

A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
yard of Sun Security.  They stop when Yu enters.

				SECURITY MAN A
		Mistress, you're back.

				YU
		It's you!  How's everything here?

				CAPTAIN
		Fine.  You've been gone a while.

				YU
		Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
		Your wife was due?

				AH WAI
		Yeah, a baby girl.

				YU
		Good!

				AH WAI
		I'll be happy if she's half as
		strong as you.

				YU
		Mrs. Wu...

				AUNT WU
		You're back!

				YU
		How's the arm?  Still sore?

				AUNT WU
		Much better.  You've been gone so
		long.

				YU
		Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
		night.

				AUNT WU
			(excited)
		I'll go and make up his room!

Aunt Wu hustles out.  Yu goes into her own room.

INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP

Yu lights incense for her former fiancé Meng.  Hearing
something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing
outside downstairs.

				JEN
		Sister Shu Lien...

INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY

Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some
clothes.  Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets
herself on the edge of Yu's bed.  Yu brings over the clothes.

				YU
		Here you must be in proper attire.

				JEN
		I'm just borrowing some clean
		clothes.  I'm not staying.

				YU
		I'll give them to you.

				JEN
		I was just passing by and wondered
		how you were.

Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on
Yu's shoulder in tears.

				JEN
		You, sister...

				YU
		Look at the trouble you've caused.
		Now you know what Giang Hu life is
		really like.  If you think of me as
		your sister, let me give you some
		sisterly advice.  You can run from
		marriage, but not your parents.

				JEN
		They forced me to marry!

				YU
		Go back to them first.  Then you
		can decide about Lo.

				JEN
		You know about Lo?

				YU
		He really loves you.  Come back to
		Peking with me.  We'll find a
		solution.

				JEN
		Where is he now?

				YU
		Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
		He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

				JEN
		You're working together to set me
		up!  I'm leaving!

				YU
		How dare you accuse us?  I always
		knew you had stolen the sword!
		I've done nothing but protect you
		and your family.  And you're repaid
		me with nothing but contempt.  Li
		Mu Bai himself spared you, and all
		you do is insult him.  We wanted
		some peace and you've ruined it all!
		You're no sister of mine!

				JEN
		What do I care?  You were never a
		real friend anyway.  But I wonder,
		how long could you last as my enemy?

Jen gets up to leave.  Yu intercepts her.

				YU
		Put the sword down!

Jen jumps out.

INT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY

Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
still practicing.

They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder.

				YU
			(calling out)
		Jen!

Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny.

				YU
		Everyone out.  Shut the doors.

The men leave.

				YU
		Fine... the friendship is over.

Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
begins her battle with Jen.

Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none
are any match for the Green Destiny.

After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks
admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands.

				YU
		Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's
		sword.

				JEN
		Come and get it if you can.

				YU
		Without the Green Destiny, you are
		nothing.

				JEN
		Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.
		Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go
		ahead.

Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.  Just as the
Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade
at Jen's neck.  She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls
back.

				YU
		Give me the sword.

Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm.

				JEN
		Take it!

Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in.

				LI
			(enraged)
		Stop it!  You don't deserve the
		Green Destiny.

				JEN
		Not another lecture!  On guard!

				LI
		Let's end this here.

				JEN
		Only the sword will settle this.

Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.

EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY

Jen runs into a sea of bamboo.  She appears to have lost Li
but is not slowing down.  Her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud.  The wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by Li.

The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges.  They glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat.  Finally Jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as Li.  The two hold their positions for a
while, as the bamboo bends.

				LI
		I only let you go because I wanted
		to see the real you.

Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.

				JEN
		What do you know about a true heart?

Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.  The bamboo
straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground.  Jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.

Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
forest.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids.  Jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with Li.  Jen loses her balance.

				JEN
		What do you want?

				LI
		What I've always wanted, to teach
		you.

				JEN
		All right.  If you can take back
		the sword in three moves, I'll go
		with you.

Li takes the sword back.

				JEN
		Give it back!

				LI
		Kneel!

				JEN
		Never!

				LI
		Then you have no use for the sword.

Li throws the sword into the rapids.

Jen dives in to retrieve it.  He follows Jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
rapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious
Jen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

It's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine
paste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the
needle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense
and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.

				FOX
		Sooner or later, they'd drag you
		back to Peking.  Your parents will
		never accept you again.  But why go
		home?  We've gone this far, we
		won't stop now.  You'll always be
		my lady.  At last, we'll be our own
		masters.  We'll be happy.  That's
		the most important thing.  All we
		have left is each other, right?
		Lie down and rest.

Jen is too weak to respond.

Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Fox scurries ahead in the rain.  Her eyes catch something,
but she keeps moving.

INT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY

Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu.

				AUNT WU
		She's crazy.  You should have
		killed her.

				YU
		I didn't have the heart.

				AUNT WU
		Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

Yu senses movement at the window.  Looking out, she sees
Jade Fox in the distance.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a
cup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up,
and walks into the rain.

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
raindrops.  Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
standing there.  Jen limps towards him while mumbling.

				JEN
		Is it me or the sword you want?

Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.

				LI
		You've been drugged!

Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.

				LI
		Where is Jade Fox?

Jen gestures that she doesn't know.  Yu and Bo enter.  Yu
looks at Jen.

				YU
		What happened?

				LI
		Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you
		get here?

				YU
		We followed Jade Fox.

Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's
direction.  Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all,
sending them flinging hither and thither.

Fox shows herself.  Li attacks her.  She falls back, bleeding
to death.

				LI
		And so you die.

Li touches his neck.

				FOX
		And so shall you!

Li pulls a single needle from his neck.

				YU
		A poisoned needle!

				FOX
		You deserve to die, but the life I
		was hoping to take... was Jen's.
		Ten years I devoted to you.  But
		you deceived me!  You hid the
		manual's true meaning.  I never
		improved... but your progress was
		limitless!  You know what poison is?
		An eight-year-old girl, full of
		deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My
		only family... my only enemy...

Jade Fox dies.

				YU
		You can't die!  Tell us what poison
		you used!  You can't die!  Tell us
		the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu
		Bai die!

				JEN
		She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
		poison.  It goes straight to the
		heart.

				LI
		My blood will soon reverse its flow.
		It's the same poison she used to
		kill my master.  There is no
		antidote.

				YU
		That can't be!  Everything has an
		antithesis!  Why not this?

				JEN
		The antidote exists.  She taught it
		to me.  The formula is simple, but
		it takes time to prepare.  Trust me.
		As you have helped me, let me help
		you.

				LI
		All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on
		as long as I can.

				YU
			(takes the comb from
			her hair)
		Take my horse and go to the compound.
		Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help
		you.  Hurry!

				JEN
		Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Bo is burying Fox in the rain.

EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - NIGHT

The guards surround Jen.  She pushes past them.

				JEN
		Where is Mrs. Wu?

Aunt Wu comes running out.

				AUNT WU
		Stop it!

Jen pulls out Yu's comb.

				JEN
		Shu Lien told me to show you this.

				AUNT WU
		Let her in.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational,
eerily calm.

				YU
		Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some
		hope...

				LI
		Shu Lien...

				YU
		Save your strength.

				LI
		My life is departing.  I've only
		one breath left.

				YU
		Use it to meditate.  Free yourself
		from this world as you have been
		taught.  Let your soul rise to
		eternity with your last breath.  Do
		not waste it... for me.

				LI
		I've already wasted my whole life.
		I want to tell you with my last
		breath... I have always loved you.
		I would rather be a ghost, drifting
		by your side... as a condemned
		soul... than enter heaven without
		you.  Because of your love... I
		will never be a lonely spirit.

Yu cries.

She kisses him lightly.  He closes his eyes.

EXT. PATH - DAY

As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine
in her hands.

INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li is in Yu's arms.  They're holding hands.  The sun shines
in.  Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead.

Jen is at the door.

				JEN
		He's gone?

Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder.

Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny.  Jen kneels.  Yu raises
the sword, but doesn't kill her.

				YU
		Bo... please take this sword back
		to Sir Te.

He takes the sword from her.

				YU
			(to Jen)
		Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.
		Lo awaits you there.  Promise me
		one thing, whatever path you take
		in this life... be true to yourself.

EXT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple
gate, and sees Lo standing there.

He runs to her.  She greets him.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - MAGIC

Jen and Lo make love.

INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him,
Jen gone.

EXT. WU TAN MOUNTAIN - DAY

Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge.  The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds.  She looks back at him.

				JEN
		Do you remember the legend of the
		young man?

				LO
		"A faithful heart makes wishes come
		true."

				JEN
		Make a wish, Lo.

Lo pauses.

				LO
			(closing his eyes)
		To be back in the desert, together
		again.

Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds.  They seem to
catch her gently, before she disappears into them.

Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down
his cheeks.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way
		to the bottom.

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB

		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!

		Stay right there!

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

	She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
	into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

				WOMAN
		He touched me and it stopped.  The

		I saw a ghost...

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

		Oh no... don't go, darlin', you

	HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
	units screech up to assist.

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
			(checks his notebook)

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the
		gun. You just tell me where you want
		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

				ERIC
			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the
	pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.
	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

	who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
				ALBRECHT

	He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

				ERIC
		Top Dollar, you're the only one

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
	hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
		hours.  All at once...

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
	eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

				ERIC
		I didn't think you could handle it
		either.

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

				LEAD SWAT
		That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
	him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
	Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

	ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

	Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

	STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

	Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
	shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

				TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
		On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
		firing!

	A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

	RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

	A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

	ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

	Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

	Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
	skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

	ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

	Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

				LEAD SWAT
		Holy shit, it's spiderman.

	He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

				LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
	Eric, trying to keep up.

	ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

	PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
		He's off the roof.  We can't see
		him.

	CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

	pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

				LEAD SWAT
		Dammit to hell!
			(beat; to men)
		Come on.

	ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

	Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
	okay, up and running.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

	as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
	stop, blocking the exit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

				ALBRECHT
			(from car)
		Come on!

	CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

	We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.
			(beat)
		You sure I can't just take you to 
		the emergency ward?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		They couldn't do anything for me.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		How 'bout the morgue?

				ERIC (O.S.)
		No.  I have one more thing to do.

	EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

	Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

	ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

				ALBRECHT
		You're gonna kill somebody else.
			(beat; no response)
		We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
		of Band-Aids?

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an 
		anniversary.  This coming night.

	HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

	High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

	INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,
	demons out for Halloween.

	ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

	walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A
	fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

	ANGLE - ELLY ON BROWNSTONE STEPS

	Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

				ELLY
		You're gonna like it here.

	A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.

	ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

	as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

				GRANGE
			(to his MEN)
		If she opens her face again, shoot
		her in the head.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a 
	gigantic gun, draws and cocks.

				ELLY

		Mom -- !

	ANGLE - GUARD #4 AND ELLY

	as he scoops her up, captive.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

	He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

				GRANGE
		You should listen to your mother.
		She said no cats.

	Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

				ELLY
		Gabriel!

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

				GRANGE
		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
	snap his shot.

				GRANGE (CONT'D)
		Say cheese.

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

	as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

	INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

	As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

	INT. LOFT - DUSK

	He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
	of the floor.  He opens it.

	INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

	with a note.

	UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

	The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

	NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

	Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

	ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

	Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

	ANGLE - THE VANITY

	as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
	makeup and smears it on.

							SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

				GRANGE
		He's just out front talking to
		himself.  You tell me. 

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	As before, but the crow is not as fast.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still
		bleed.  How they need air.

	Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Break its neck.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
	the bird.

	Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
	dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
	the hole.

	EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
	himself.

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,
		Mister Draven!  The girl will die
		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

	September 14, 1992

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

	BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
	perched crow large in the f.g.

	TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

	As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

				DIMITRI (O.S.)
		We're losing the light; let's pack
		it in.

	ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

	TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
	style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward 
	the sky.

				ALEXI
		Snow, maybe?

				DIMITRI
		What, you gonna ski on this?

	He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

				DIMITRI (CONT'D)
		Come on, let's bag this.  It's
		beer time.

	Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

	LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

	As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
	wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
	sequence.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
	the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
	as it begins to sprinkle rain.

	ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

	A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
	offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
	totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
	Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
	day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
	unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
	stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

				ELLY
		Guess the picnic got rained out.

	She looks down o.s. at --

	ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

	as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

	RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

	as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
	near Shelly Webster's.

	ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

	TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
	granite, darkening it.

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

	It blinks in its alien way.

	WITH THE CROW

	as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
	headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

	ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

	She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

				ELLY
		Oh, scary.

	The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
				ELLY
		What are you, like, the night
		watchman?

	Another blink from El Birdo.

	CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

	as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
	back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
	alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
	continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
	the middle of the city.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

	CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

				MICKEY (O.S.)
		What this place needs is a good
		natural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
		tornado...

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

	ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

	MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
	open-front fast foodery.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta put the mustard
		underneath first.

				MICKEY
		Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.

				ALBRECHT
		Here, let me do it.

	He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
	cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
	surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
	the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

				ALBRECHT
		Come on... onion.  Don't cheap
		out on me.  Lotta onions.

	MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

				MICKEY
		Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

				ALBRECHT
		How do you ride that thing on a 
		wet street?

				ELLY
		Talent. Hi.

				ALBRECHT
		Care for a hot dog?

				ELLY
		You buying?

				ALBRECHT
		I'm buying.

	Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

				ELLY
		No onions though, okay?

				ALBRECHT
			(horror)
		No onions?

				ELLY
		They make you fart.

	Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

				MICKEY
		What's goin' on, Elly?

				ELLY
		I went to see a friend of mine.

				MICKEY
		Well, how's your friend?

				ELLY
		She's still dead.

	Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
	factness.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
	and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

	as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

	LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

	A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
	stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
	plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

	RESUME THE CROW

	as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

	CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

	It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

	CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

	A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
	we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

	MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
	long duster and a cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

	DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

	NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

	Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
	arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
	beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

	CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

	Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
	knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

	RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

	The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
	parts the earth to grasp the rose.

	SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

	as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
	headstone.

	LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

	Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
	back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
	from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

	as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

	ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

	water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
	on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
	to the tree.

	ANGLE -  ERIC

	Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
	The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
	looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		What the hell are you?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Interested?  Follow the crow.

	NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
	charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

	Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
	eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
	Skull Cowboy is gone.

	LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

	Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
	off, following the crow.

	EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

	A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

	INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

	A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
	devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
	ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
	with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
	darting eyes.

	COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
	with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
	And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
	prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
	arson cocktail to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof
		accelerator.  I squirt you with
		this, you could jump in the 
		Detroit river and burn all the way
		to the bottom.

	INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
	canisters, an LED timer, wires.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		You know, Lake Erie actually
		caught on fire once, from all the
		crap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
		that.

	He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

				T-BIRD (CONT'D)
		We're ready to rock.

	Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
	it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

				SKANK
		What about working girl?

	INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

				T-BIRD
		What about her?

				SKANK
		I say we leave her here to fry,
		man.

	T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

				T-BIRD
		No.  Let's take her with us.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

	EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
	fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
	the back seat.

				TB
			(pissed off)
		Skank, shut her the fuck up!

	SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

				SKANK
		Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red
		light!

	EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
	nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

	Reacting, with a mouthful.

				ALBRECHT
		Goddammit.

	Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

				MICKEY
		Call it in?

	Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, do it!

		Stay right there!

	HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

				MICKEY

		You want I should save this for

	EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

				SKANK (O.S.)
		Dump her, man, dump her!

	The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
	war hoop from the guys inside.

	ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

	Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
	car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

	ANGLE - THE WOMAN

	hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
	stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
	she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

	Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

	NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
	of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
	fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
	must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
	accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

	FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

	The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
	hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
	blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

				FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN

	An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

	She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
	into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

	Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

				ALBRECHT
		Here now!  You're gonna be okay!
		Can you understand me?  I'm a
		police officer...

	The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

				WOMAN
		He touched me and it stopped.  The
		pain.

				ALBRECHT
		What did you say?

				WOMAN
		I saw a ghost...

	Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

				ALBRECHT
		Oh no... don't go, darlin', you
		stay with me, now... shit!

	HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

	BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
	units screech up to assist.

	EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
	the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

	ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

	Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

	BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

	"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
	distinct and immediately identifiable.

	ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

	Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
	Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
	from:

	ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

	The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
	debris.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
	boots in the trash.  Flames.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
	shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
	with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

	PUSH IN ON ERIC

	as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
	chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
	wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
	His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

	ANGLE - THe CROW

	Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
	communication is taking place.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
	crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
	his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
	SIRENS

				ERIC
		Fire.  In the rain.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
	rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
	trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
	the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
	establishment since we are --

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

	Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
	side.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
	(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
	through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
	monitors is hot with surveillance.

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
	VIETNAMESE.

				LAO
		(formal greeting)

				NWA
		(dismissiveness, contempt, then
		chastizing anger as:)

	Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

				LAO
		(phony assuagement)

				NWA
		(knows it's bullshit)

	Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
	breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errant
	 
				NWA
		(respect is required)

				LAO
		(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.

				NGO NWA
		(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.

				LAO
		(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.

				LAO
			(in perfect English)
		When I spoke of an offering, I
		didn't mean an offering to you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

	Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
	Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
	door OPENS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

	Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
	affirmatively.

				GRANGE
		You gonna smoke his bones now, or
		however it is you do it?

	Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
	the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

	Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
	Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

	Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

	The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
	leaving another scar.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

				ERIC
		"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
		and makes no sound at all.  And in
		the doorway nightly sits to watch
		the darkness fall.  I think
		he loves the lady night..."
			(to crow)
		Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
		else?  Something in between?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Inscrutable.  No answer here.

	RESUME ERIC

	Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

				ERIC
		Thanks for sharing that.

	ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
	other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
	GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
	is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE
	of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and
	T-Bird on approach.

				GIDEON
		Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the 
		night, here they come.  Tweedledum
		and Tweedledummer.

	Skank riles

				SKANK
		Hey, blow me, fat boy!

	Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

				GIDEON
		Blow yourself, bigmouth.

				T-BIRD
			(interposing)
		Whoa, hey, whoa.
			(hands up)
		Business.

	He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

				GIDEON
		Whatcha got?

	NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

	Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot 
	and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

				T-BIRD
		Coupla more rings... 24k.

				GIDEON
		18k.  Crap.

				T-BIRD
		...necklace... pearls...

				GIDEON
		Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

				T-BIRD
		Leather purse...

	He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

				GIDEON
		What's this -- a little, ah,
		bloodstain, right?
			(doesn't matter)
		Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm
		doin' you a --

				T-BIRD
		Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a 
		favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

				SKANK
		You wouldn't want Top Dollar not 
		to smile.

	Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands
	over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
	the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
	on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

				ERIC
		All right.

	And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
	falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
	still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
	runs out of the frame.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

	as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
	TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

	He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
	roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
	WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
	strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

	FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

	keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

	MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

	As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
	where there is no connecting building.

	CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

	as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
	grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him 
	downward.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

	Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs
	for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
	executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
				ERIC
		Gotcha.

	He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the 
	ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
	rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

	It's a looooooong way down.

	ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

	as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
	if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
	facedown to his back.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one 
	piece.

	ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

	It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
	examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

				ERIC
		Thanks.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

	RESUME ERIC

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Where're we going next -- the
		sewer?

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
	The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
	door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	It just blinks at him. 

	INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and
	sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

	ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

	Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the
	building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights
	on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

	ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

	A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
	which now sags, faded.

	A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that
	this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand
	on the banister.

	ANGLE - THE CROW

	as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

	ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

	Eric has had enough.

				ERIC
		Are we finished yet?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER
	sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

	PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

	stiffening as he suffers his second --

	FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set
	in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).
	The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop 
	noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a
	DETECTIVE steps over to him.

				ALBRECHT
		Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
		The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
			(checks his notebook)

	Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

	He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the 
	crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

				ERIC
		"Draven, Eric."

	EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
	entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
	nears.

	ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

	Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises
	her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

				BOUNCER
		Hey!  You got any ID?

				ELLY
		Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my,
		sides.

	The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in. 

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight
	with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering
	MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to
	be badder than the next.

	TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach 
	DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her 
	obvious.

				ELLY
		Mom --?

				DARLA
		I told you you're not supposed
		to come in here.

				ELLY
			(a quick lie)
		I lost my key.

	Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps
	it into Elly's hand.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Hey, Darla -- before we die of old
		age, how about it --?

				DARLA
			(to Elly)
		Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

	RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit
	Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped
	from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape
	whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of
	disuse.

	PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

	as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

	NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

	He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

	ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

	A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

	He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

	as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

	FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he
	saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

							FLASH ENDS.

	UP ANGLE - ERIC

	Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers
	the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

	FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred
	points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

							FLASH ENDS.

	REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

	as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

				ERIC
		No!  Don't look!  No! No!

	He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through
	the masonry wall.
	FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they
	collapse on the bed.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

				ERIC
			(whispering)
		Stop it.

	His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like
	a drowning man.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL

	watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

	INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

				FUNBOY (O.S.)
		Let's have some fun.

	Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.
	T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

				T-BIRD	You first.

				TIN-TIN
		You're outta your fuckin' mind.

	Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and
	T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

				T-BIRD
		No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is.

	Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's
	face, cocking.

				SKANK
		Fuck you, T-Bird.

	Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed
	right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

				T-BIRD
		I love you too, you madman.

	They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,
	Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla
	delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

				FUNBOY
		Hey, pussycat.

	INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

	Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

	He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a 
	faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch
	the dark stain of old blood.

	FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird
	instantly on top of her, rough.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC

	as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where
	he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

	FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one
	arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

	The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,
	which shatters.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

	Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward
	the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

	AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

	A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a
	page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...
	Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne
	cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...
	Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a
	clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug 
	high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window
	blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

	ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

	He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

	INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

	Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

				FUNBOY
		More fun than a torture chamber.

	Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank
	nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather 
	trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

				TIN-TIN
		I hate this goddamn thing...

	ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

	INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

	An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to
	show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of
	dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

	ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats
	it.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

				ERIC
		We have company.

	ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

	Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and
	Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the
	dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Having fun yet?  No?
			(beat)
		I'll give you a hint.  Remember
		whatshername?

				ERIC
		Shelly?

				SKULL COWBOY
		Miss her?

				ERIC
		Yes.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Kill the men who killed you both,
		and the Day of the Dead will be
		your reunion.

	The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-
	Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		You must use your eyes.

	He points to the crow.

	ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

	Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the
	bird's eyes.  He rolls.

	ON THE CROW

	It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's
	ROLL finishes him up nearby.

				ERIC
		Goddammit.

	He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but
	the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

	FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife
	stuck in his shoulder.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Get it?

				ERIC
		Leave me alone -- !

	He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

				SKULL COWBOY
			(contempt)
		Do something about it.
	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

	A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across
	the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

	as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

	ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

	FLIES feet first out into space.

	CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

	Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

	High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
	stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-
	down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
	building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he
	relaxes, and swings back inside.

	INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

	He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is
	gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

	ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

				ERIC
		I guess I'm not ready to leave...
		just yet.

	He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this
	time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		The last time we saw each other,
		I didn't do so well.
			(holds cat up)
		Huh, Gabriel?

	He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the
	Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I bet you need some cat food...
		right?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

	Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An
	occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
	by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

	Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by 
	his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
	a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
	RAZZLES b.g.

	EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.
	And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

	EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

	He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as
	he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom 
	box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
	Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

				TIN-TIN
		Three hundred and your a 
		gunslinger.

	HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

	As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief
	shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

				RATSO
		Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
		for the money, man, I promise,
		Leslie put me up to it, please,
		man, don't --
			(choking scream)

	Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

				TIN-TIN
		Ratty -- shut the fuck up.

	Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes
	slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF 
	the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Another satisfied customer?

	TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

	galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a
	fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
	the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

				TIN-TIN
		Who the hell is that?
			(beat, venomous)
		Come on out man, I won't hurt
		you.

	ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

	He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a 
	long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		Hello, Tin-Tin.

	ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

	trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

				TIN-TIN
		Little early from trick-or-treat,
		homie.
			(re: Ratso)
		This dick trying to bushwack me.

				ERIC
		Murderer.

	Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

				TIN-TIN
		Guess you got that goddamn right.

	He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

	TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

	His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
	his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

				ERIC
		Try harder.  Try again.

	SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

	as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps
	hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,
	almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

	As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it
	and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  Halloween.  A man
		and a woman.  In a loft.  You
		helped to murder them.

				TIN-TIN
		Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...
			(beat)
		Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her
		too, I think.

				ERIC
		You cut her.  You raped her.
			(rage)
		You watched!

				TIN-TIN
		Hey, I got my rocks off, so
		fuck you in the ass, man.
		
	They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off
	the Tragedy mask.

				ERIC
		I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.

				TIN-TIN
		I don't know you...

	But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
	Fear.  Sweat.

	For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

				TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
		Holy shit... you're dead, man...

	EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Victims.  Aren't we all.

	INT. LOFT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

	as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on 
	suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

	ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

	Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down
	big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's 
	trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

	INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

	Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with
	cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is 
	seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-
	sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

	WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle
	stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...

	In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up 
	as he realizes he's in for another --

	FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric
	(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

				SHELLY
		Your scary quotient needs work.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.
	But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

	FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

				SHELLY
		I think red's my color, don't you?

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC

	wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a
	hairbrush.

	FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,
	trailing broken glass.

							FLASH ENDS.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

	Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

	FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

	his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended
	yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,
	triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,
	but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Glad to see you're finally with
		the program.

				ERIC
		Bugger off to the graveyard, skull-
		face, I'm busy.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You work for the dead.  Forget
		that, and you can forget it all.

	The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow
	perched on the edge of the mirror now.

				ERIC
		Forget this.

	He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave
	white.

	ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

	coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.
	Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

	FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down
	in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both
	corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

							FLASH ENDS.
	RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

				ERIC
		She always red red was her color.

	EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

	We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates
	the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow
	harlequin smile.

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

	A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

	EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

	crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

	CLOSE-UP - VANITY

	Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

	CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

	looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.
	Thunder rumbles long o.s.

	ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

	The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

	Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat
	flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned
	collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

	SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

	as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

				ERIC
		All right, bad guys...

	FRONT VIEW - ERIC

	Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

				ERIC
			(in drawn out yell)
		Here I commme -- !

	PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
	window, his voice a howl.

	UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

	Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
	SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

	Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and
	several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A
	detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

				TORRES
		Couldn't have happened to a nicer 
		couple.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

	Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of 
	him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

				ALBRECHT
		Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not
		here, neither is T-Bird -- none
		of Top Dollar's number ones.

				TORRES
		You know, you sure got a hard-on for
		a guy that's guilty of zip on
		paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime;
		what's the matter, don't you like
		adult entertainment?

				ALBRECHT
		This sack of shit is called Tin-
		Tin.

				TORRES
		Don't any of your little pals have
		real, grown up names?

				ALBRECHT
		He was a runner for Top Dollar.
		Just muscle.

				TORRES
		Was.
				ALBRECHT
			(sigh)
		This isn't Top Dollar's style
		anyway.  This was somebody else.
		Somebody new.

	Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

				TORRES
		And you're gonna tell me who.

				ALBRECHT
		Who ever made that.

	Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow
	silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

				TORRES
		What in the hell... do you
		call that?

				ALBRECHT
		I call it blood, Detective.  If
		you want, you can call it graffiti.

	INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.
	Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast
	from another time and place.

	TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

	looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

				GIDEON
		Piss off, we're closed.

	As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum
	and approaches the front door.

				GIDEON
		Fucking creatures of the night;
		they never goddamn learn.

	Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
	against the frosted glass of the front door.

				GIDEON (CONT'D)
		HEY!!

	And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the
	door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes
	rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
	knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
	Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
	disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

				ERIC
		"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of
		someone gently rapping, rapping at
		my chamber door."
			(pause)
		You heard me rapping, right?

	LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

	reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

				GIDEON
		Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing
		asshole, you're breakin'
		and enterin' and you just bought me a
		fucking door!

	During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
	shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

	Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

				ERIC
		I'm looking for something in an
		engagement ring.  Gold.

	As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
	cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

				GIDEON
		You're looking for a coroner,shit-
		for-brains!

	And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

	NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

	No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage
	above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.
	Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

				ERIC
		I repeat: a gold engagement ring.
		It was pawned here, a year ago, by
		another gentleman whose name, I
		believe was... "T-Bird"?

	IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

	Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Cute nickname, don't you think?

				GIDEON
			(gasping)
		I ain't got no fuckin' ring.

				ERIC
		Wrong answer.

	Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

				GIDEON
		All's I got is in a box!  Behind
		the counter!

	Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
	his own pierced hand, immobilized.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

	scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.  
	Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

	Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

	TIGHTER ON ERIC

	He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble
	struggles and invective, o.s.

				ERIC
		No... no... no... no...

	He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

	CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

	Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

	FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUMING ERIC

	He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
	decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
	Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
	spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
	rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

				ERIC
		Tin-Tin confided in me, before he
		ran out of breath.  You have one
		chance to live.
				GIDEON
		No fucking way.  He'll kill me.

				ERIC
		Who would waste time killing you...
		besides me?

	Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

				GIDEON
			(cowed)
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		Another jolly nickname?

				GIDEON
		You want those assholes, you want 
		Top Dollar.

				ERIC
		T-Bird?

				GIDEON
		Like the car.  He hangs out with
		Skank. that little ass-hair, and
		they hang at the Pit -- hell,
		Funboy lives there.  Ask Top
		Dollar.

				ERIC
		A whole club of pirates, with
		pirate names...

	Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
	flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
	hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

				ERIC
		You feed off the living.

	SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
	Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
	entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
	a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
	for it.

	ON GIDEON

	As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

				GIDEON
		You walk outta here Top Dollar
		will erase your ass!  Top Dollar
		owns the fucking street here and
		you can't dick with me, you son of
		a bitch! 

	RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

	The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at
	Gideon's position.

				ERIC
		One chance to live.  Take it.

	MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

	as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the
	rear door with a bleat of terror.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR  

	as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

	EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
	the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
	glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of
	the fireball.

	LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

	lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun
	into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
	from his own clothes.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Don't move! I said don't move.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC

	as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
	Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

				ERIC
		I thought the police always said
		"freeze:.

	Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
	Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
	Gideon's.

				ALBRECHT
		I'm the police and I say don't
		move, Snow White.  You're under
		arrest; I don't care what else is 
		wrong with you!  You move and
		you're dead.

	Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
	submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

				ERIC
		And I say I'm dead... and I move.

				ALBRECHT
		No further.  I'm serious.

	Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

				ERIC
		Then shoot, if you will.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

	He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

				ALBRECHT
		Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

	NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

				ERIC
		You must listen carefully:  the 
		Fire Department will be here soon.
		There is an injured man in the 
		alley who needs assistance.
			(meaningfully)
		As Shelly Webster once needed your 
		assistance, and as you are shortly 
		going to need my assistance.

	Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
	gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

				ALBRECHT
		You wanna run that back for me one
		time?

	SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

				ERIC
		Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the
		street here."  He will "erase
		my ass."

				ALBRECHT
		You don't say.

				ERIC
		I know Top Dollar has turned your 
		streets into his hell.

				ALBRECHT
		Fucking A, my friend.

				ERIC
		The others are called Skank, T-
		Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.
			(beat)
		Watch me, office Albrecht.

	Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
	Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Watch it...

	Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
	then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

	as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

	and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

				ALBRECHT
		You're the one who did Tin-Tin...

	PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does
	a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin
	to bounce red and blue off his face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up
		looking like a mime from hell.
			(beat)
		Least he didn't do that "walking
		against the wind" shit;  I hate
		that.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

	A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
	marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

	INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

	T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES
	from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,
	the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

				DICKEY BIRD
		T-Bird.  Thrill me.

				T-BIRD
		Business.

	T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes
	open for him.

	INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

	T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse
	Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the 
	movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

				PORN QUEEN (O.S.)
		I don't know how to describe how
		I feel, Lance -- so restless --

				PORN KING (O.S.)
		You're my Moon Queen, Angelique.

				PORN QUEEN (o.S.)
		Oooh -- I want you're rocket right
		now in my Sea of Tranquility -- 
		Lance --

	ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

	As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends
	the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

	ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

	As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By
	the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting
	table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug
	paraphernalia, weapons.

	Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that
	admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired
	silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by
	Showtime's exterior neon.

	This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid 
	casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Wild fucking night.  I hear our
		pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.

				T-BIRD
		And Gideon's just burned all the
		down to the foundation.

	Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

				T-BIRD (CONT'D) 
		I didn't have nothin to do with
		that.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bet that pisses you off, right?

				T-BIRD
		Top, what the fuck is going on
		tonight?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all
		hotwired and aggressive.  No
		combat moves until I check this
		out.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

	Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
	abandoned car.

	ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

	Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

	CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

	She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

	TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

	She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

				ELLY
		What are you supposed to be?  A clown?

	CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past
	his crow makeup.

				ERIC
		Sometimes.

	He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
	in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

	WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

				ELLY
		You look like a rock star without a
		job.

				ERIC
		I dabble.  May I?

	He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
	may observe the Pit.

				ELLY
		If you're not some kinda child 
		molester.

	Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He 
	shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly. 

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.
	INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and
	rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty
	in this milieu.

	ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

	Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life
	itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

				TOP DOLLAR
		I thought Halloween was tomorrow
		night.

	An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

	INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top
	Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his 
	passage.  He shoves through.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Get outta my way, you mooks.

	Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

				LAO
		An unexpected pleasure.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Bad news.  Alot of action on the
		streets tonight, and nobody
		bothered to clear it with me.  Tin-
		Tin got himself whacked.

				LAO
		Who got himself what?

				TOP DOLLAR
		One of mine.  And it wasn't a 
		standard hit.

				LAO
		I had heard something like this.
			(beat)
		Describe it for me.  The "hit".

				TOP DOLLAR
		I was wondering if you could tell
		me anything... about a wildcat
		operative.

				LAO
		I know of no one.
			(beat)
		But even if there is, I am sure it
		is nothing outside your capacity 
		to deal with?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Anybody violates my turf -- our 
		turf -- I'll rip out there heart 
		and show it to 'em.

				LAO
		To be sure.  Now tell how your 
		friend died.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,
	sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police
	scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		Annie?

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

	Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

				ANNABELLA
		Whatever it is, the answer's no,
		Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

				ALBRECHT
		Annie, I need a file.

	There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

				ANNABELLA
		Speak up.
			(beat; her guard up)
		Clear it with the Captain if you
		need a file.

				ALBRECHT
		This is special, darlin'.  Please?

	Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

				ANNABELLA
		Just don't tell me you "owe me
		one."  What file?

				ALBRECHT
		Double homicide.  A year ago.
		Las Halloween.

	EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

	Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
	now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
	curbs across the street from the Pit.

				ELLY
		My mom works over there.  I'm
		waiting for her, but she's
		probably with him, right now.

				ERIC
		Who?
				
				ELLY
		Mister Funboy.

				ERIC
		Mister Funboy lives there?

	TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

				ELLY
		He has a room, upstairs.  I don't
		like him very much.

	Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the 
	car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
	white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Can you play that thing or do you
		just carry it around everywhere?

	Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

				ERIC
		I can pick out a tune now 
		and again.

				ELLY
		Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
			(re: doll)
		It used to be her favorite.

				ERIC
		Does she have a name?

				ELLY
		No name.  You sure ask a lot of
		questions.

	Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly 
	unexpected flash.

	FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
	makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

							FLASH ENDS.

	RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

	Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges. 

				ELLY (OS)
			(smart alec)
		Hel-lo?  Earth to anybody...?

	Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		Do you feel okay.

				ERIC
		No.

				ELLY
		You gotta go now, I bet.

				ERIC
		I have to go.

	Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

	INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

	As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

				GRANGE
		Top Dollar?

				BOUNCE
		Never heard of him.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

				BOUNCER
		Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin'
		Darla.  Pay for your own beer and
		they'll prob'ly be down before you 
		can drink it.

	INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.
	Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

	flipping through the file. Smoking.

	ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

	Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft 
	building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

	As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file
	several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique... 
	including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at
	Club Trash.

	A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle
	of all this research, startling Albrecht.

	ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.  Your ass is
		already in enough trouble for this shit.

				ALBRECHT
		I knew that.

	Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

	CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

	It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court
	Apartments...

				ALBRECHT
		Another nice white girl with a
		cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.

	Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Shelly Webster.  And her nice 
		white boyfriend, Eric Draven.

	With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-
	up, like the blood.

				ANNABELLA
		Your last little wild goose chase
		got you busted back to the Beat 
		Patrol, just like in a bad
		detective story, Eddie. Are we
		doing the wildgoose thing again?

	UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

				ALBRECHT
		Could be.

				ANNABELLA
		You gonna wind up working at a school
		crosswalk.   that doughnut's 
		chocolate you, know.

	PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

	PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

				ALBRECHT
		Well, hello there...chocolate,

				ANNABELLA
		Don't thank me.

				ALBRECHT
		Thanks, babe.

	INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

				ERIC
		It's a Raymond Chandler evening
		And the pavements are all wet, And
		I'm lurking in the shadows, for it 
		hasn't happened ...

	TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

	Impish.  Clown killer.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		... yet.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back
	protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a
	good overview of the room.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

	EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

	Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail
	flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN
	ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.
	Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

				DARLA
		Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it.

	CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

	As the plunger depresses.

	ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

	As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,
	scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a
	giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

				DARLA
		It's a big fucking bird...

	She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.
	Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the 
	sheets at his side.

				FUNBOY
		It's a squab.  Here bird, Here,
		birdie...

	NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

	Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the 
	bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

				ERIC
		Here Funboy.

	Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle 
	flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to
	maintain against his high.

				FUNBOY
		Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do
		that, man.  I nearly had a fucking
		heart attack.

				DARLA
		Fun -- look at that guy...

				FUNBOY
		It's just the dope, don't worry

				DARLA
		Fun, he's not going away; he's 
		scaring the piss outta me!

				FUNBOY
		Not me.

	Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems
	totally focused.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		Time for you to take your bird and 
		leave, freako.

	Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet
	punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.
				ERIC
		Take your shot funboy.  You got 
		me, dead bang.

	Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly
	past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

				FUNBOY
		You are seriously fucked up, man.
		Just look at yourself.

	In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

				FUNBOY (CONT'D)
		BANG!  He shoots, he scores!

	Then his expression drags a little bit.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

				ERIC
		Bull's eye.  Good shot.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor
	around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

				ERIC
		Stay.

	Eric twists her arm.

	CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

	where we may clearly see the needle tracks.  

	UP ANGLE - ERIC 

				ERIC
		Morphine is bad for you.

	He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see
	the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,
	Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.
	Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

	ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

				FUNBOY
		How the hell did you do that?
		
				ERIC
		Magic.

	Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

				FUNBOY
		Either die or do a solo.

	Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem
	to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
	Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

				ERIC
		Neither.

				FUNBOY
		Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

	Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
	gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on
	top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric
	relentlessly.

				FUNBOY
		I hate trespassers!
			(whack!)
		I hate prowlers!
			(whack!)
		I hate peeping toms!
			(whack!)
		And right now I hate you!

	ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

	as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by
	his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.
	Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he 
	looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

				FUNBOY
		Ahh, the hell with it, I still got
		five shots left.

	In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
	crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
	hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

				FUNBOY
		Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what
		you did to my sheets, you lame
		piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!

				ERIC
		Does it hurt?

				FUNBOY
		Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass,
		clown-faced fuck, of course it
		fucking hurts!  What the shit are
		you gonna do about this?!

	Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of
	morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already 
	inserted.

				ERIC
		I have some pain killer right here.

	And he fills the syringe all the way.

	ANGLE ON FUNBOY

	as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing
	terror.

				FUNBOY
		No, wait, no WAIT, that's too
		much, man, that's like overkill,
		nobody can take that much, you're
		wasting it -- !

				ERIC
		Your pain ends now.

	And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
	the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

	Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
	the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
	his eyes.

	The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Howdy
			(beat)
		You look a mess.  Like an ole
		cooter dog.

	TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

	streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

				SKULL COWBOY
		Getting a little ambitious and
		extracurricular, aren't we?

				ERIC
		Go away.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You need to learn to mind your own
		business or you'll never get where
		you think you're going.

				ERIC
		Shut up.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Maybe I was wrong about you.

	The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
	a little shake of his skull-head.

	Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
	confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

				ERIC
		Your daughter is out there, on the
		street, waiting for you.

	She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
	Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

				ERIC
		Go.  Now.

	Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
	a glance back at Funboy.

	Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
	stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
	Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
	takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

	INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

	As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door
	behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

				BOUNCER
		Hey, g'night, Darla.
			(to Grange)
		That there is Darla.

				GRANGE
		Funboy?

	Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire
	stairs door.

	INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes
	when he sees:

	GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

	Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

	RESUME GRANGE

	Eyes darting, drawn to --

	GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

	A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's
	blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

	RESUME GRANGE

	whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

	ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

	The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,
	guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.
	He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out
	into the night.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

	He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless
	expression on his face as we --

							CUT TO:

	INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

	Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to
	the late-working Annabella en route.

	EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
	cat silent, matching pace.

	NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
	shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

				ERIC
		Freeze.

	Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

				ALBRECHT
		Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!

	Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I told you cops don't say
		"freeze".

	He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		You, my friend, are dead.  I saw
		your body.  You got buried.

				ERIC
		I saw it, too.

	Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he
	is hesitant about touching the file.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Walk with me.

	As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

				ALBRECHT
		You died, man.  I can't believe it
		but here you are.  Last year,
		you and your girlfriend --

				ERIC
		I need you to tell me what you
		remember.  What happened to us?

				ALBRECHT
		You went out the window.  She was
		beaten and raped.  She died in the 
		hospital.

	They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Hey, you asked, man.
			(beat)
		She held on for thirty hours in 
		intensive care.  Hemorrhage,
		trauma.  He body just finally
		gave it up.
			(beat; regret)
		I saw it and couldn't do jack for 
		her.

	Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
	Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
	his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

	TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

	We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the 
	Flash.

	NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

	And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
	head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

				ALBRECHT
		You okay, man?  I mean, what just
		happened.

				ERIC
		The venom of bad memories.  You
		were there; you saw her.  I saw
		you seeing her.

	Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		You gotta understand -- I was 
		hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
		a clue, something to work with.
		But she only said one thing to me 
		before she died.

	Eric lowers his head, penitent.

				ERIC
		My name.

				ALBRECHT
			(fizzles)
		I'm sorry as hell, man.

				ERIC
		Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus
		change...

	TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

	Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
	contemplative puff from it.

				ERIC
		Halloween is coming, soon.  You
		will have Top Dollar if you watch
		for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.

				ALBRECHT
		I should be trying to stop you.

	Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

				ERIC
		Thank you.  For giving a damn.

				ALBRECHT
		My pleasure.
				ERIC
		Don't smoke these.

	As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and 
	simultaneously ducks out of frame.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

	to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.
	He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

				ALBRECHT
		Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.

	MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

	Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
	away from Albrecht's position.

	INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

	Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, 
	as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and
	is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to
	him.

				GRANGE
		The son of a bitch winked at me.
		The he jumped.  Three stories.

	Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's
	tale.

				LAO
		Did you see an animal of any kind?
		Did you see a bird?

				GRANGE
			(puzzled)
		No.  I saw a guitar.
			(beat; irritated)
		This isn't some rock-n-roller
		you forgot to pay, is it?
			(beat)
		There was a drawing on the wall 
		that looked like a bird.  In 
		blood.

	Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

				LAO
		Good.

				Grange
		It could've been a chicken...

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

	A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
	store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
	store side.

				SKANK
		I wish to hell I had torched
		Gideon's, that fat fuck.

				T-BIRD
		I wish to hell I knew who it was
		that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
		doll last night.

	ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

	They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross 
	themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the
	liquor store.

				T-BIRD
		We need some smokes and some road
		beers.

				SKANK
		Got it.

	Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

	WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two
	12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
	one wearing a long duster.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

	as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine
	rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the
	corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

	EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

	as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, 
	snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

	INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

	Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD

	He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
	one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
		
				T-BIRD
		What the fuck are you supposed to
		be, man?!

	INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder 
	holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

				ERIC
		I'm your passenger.  You drive.
		And stop talking.

	TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

	on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

	He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and
	glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

				SKANK
		What's all this happy horseshit?

	And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but
	the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

				AXEL
		Alright, alright, alright --
		everybody be cool and stay exactly
		where you are.

	Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a 
	gigantic Auto Mag.

				CHOPPER
		Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun.

	Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		Faster, T-Bird.  Faster.  You're
		a hell of a wheelman; you know you
		can drive faster.

	ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

	Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.
	T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

				T-BIRD
		You call it, blood -- you got the
		gun. You just tell me where you want
		to go.

	Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver 
	as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

				ERIC
		That's good.  We're going 
		someplace you've never been
		before.

	EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

	as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking  
	wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

	Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large
	styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

				MJ
		Smells like rain.

				SPEEG
		Smells like a septic tank.  You
		got that cream stuff?

				MJ
		In the bag.

	Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

				SPEEG   
		I hate this cream stuff.  They
		can't even call it cream, legally.

	They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

				MJ
		What in the crap?

	MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.

				SPEEG
		Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!

	EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT

	as the cruiser roars out to give chase.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

	Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

				ERIC
		You caught one.  Drive faster.

				T-BIRD
		Man, you gonna get us killed dead
		and I don't even know what you
		want!

	Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

				ERIC
		I want you to stop talking.  And 
		drive.  Drive faster.

	Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips
	for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to
	T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's
	tape.  What Eric needs.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

	as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		You're very popular.  Thought
		you could handle this thing.

	T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

				T-BIRD
		To hell with you.

			(wry)
		Naturally.

	INSERT - SPEEDOMETER

	Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.


	EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

	A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
	city.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop
	tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
	It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.

	INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT

	as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
	fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.

	INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT

	T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic.

				T-BIRD
		So what -- you gonna rape me now?

				ERIC
		Time for your reward, T.  Payback
		with interest earned.

	Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT

	A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.

	ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.

	loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.

	INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

	SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the

	Throat taped hard against the headrest.

	The car is now in gear, idling.

	ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

	He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.
	No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

				ERIC
		A little restrictive?  Good.
			(chilling)
		You held her down and raped her.
		You were the first.  She burned
		while you were inside of her.
			(re: bomb)
		What's the lag on this?  About
		twenty seconds, would you say?

	T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the
	wheel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I've comrades in hell, T-bird.
		Give them my best.

	Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

	INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

	The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the
	pedal.

	ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

	Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The
	car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a
	football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the
	clip.

	INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs
	bullets from the clip, one by one.

	INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

	T-bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes MMMMMMMMHHH!

	CLOSE-UP - THE CLIP IN ERIC'S HAND

	thumbing out the final bullet.

	EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

				ERIC
		All gone.

	ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE

	Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
	phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.  It hits.
	Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-
	Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He
	prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He 
	flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

	HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

	walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
	a burning crow shape. 

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	CLOSE-UP of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed
	looking eggs.  Kind gross.

	ANGLE - DARLA AT THE STOVE.

	NOT THRILLED WITH HER OWN PROGRESS.

				DARLA
		I never was too good at this 
		domestic shit.

	ANGLE - ELLY AT LIVING ROOM WINDOW

	staring outside at nothing in particular.  Yet.

				ELLY
		Don't say "shit".
			(beat)
		That's okay.  Corn Flakes are
		okay.  Anything.

	She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN.
	Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his 
	roof playing the guitar.

	EXT. ROOF OF LOFT BUILDING DAWN

	EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as
	CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
	cables to:

	ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
	streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he 
	tries the tune again.

	INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
	around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

	ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

	He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.
	We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
	He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

				IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, shut the fuck up!

	Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

	EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

	Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili
	dog.

				MICKEY
		Chili dog for breakfast... it's
		original.

				ELLY
		Mom tried to cook.

				MICKEY
		Oh.

				CUSTOMER (O.S.)
		Hey, Mickey, I need a special
		with everything.  No sawdust.

				MICKEY
			(to Elly)
		Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.

	Mickey EXITS FRAME.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		You're Elly, right?  I know your
		mom.

	Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car
	is parked across the street, b.g.

				ELLY
		A lot of people "know" my mom.

	Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

				GRANGE
		I know your friend, too -- the one
		that looks like a rock star.

				ELLY
		I don't know you.

				GRANGE
			(easily)
		I'd like to get in touch with him.

	Elly sizes Grange up.

				ELLY
		You're not a cop, either.  What do
		you want him for?

				GRANGE
		I'm looking for a good guitar man.

				ELLY
		Right.

	Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
	the countertop to Mickey.

				ELLY (CONT'D)
		You buying?
			(cuts him some slack)
		He kinda wanders around.  You'll
		see him if you pay attention.

				GRANGE
		I need to find him kind of soon,
		Elly.


	INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

	No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

	He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity
	in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard
	against the bedroom doorframe.

	FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window
	wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is
	embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties
	that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples
	down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the
	floor...

							FLASH ENDS.

	LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

	hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing
	as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM

	embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's.

	FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an
	extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC

	as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories.

	ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

	executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.
	He grasps it with both hands.

	FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each
	moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.
	But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

	His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping
	them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like
	Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before
	him on the sill.

				ERIC
		That's better.

	He wipes his torso down with a towel.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		It's almost time.

	He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can
	HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful
	fist.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has
	a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

				SKANK
		Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face
		all painted white like some kinda
		fuckin' kabuki homo!

	WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 
	and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and
	rinses his nostrils with brandy.

				LAO
		Sounds like our "Crow" is
		out-maneuvering you.

				TOP DOLLAR
		"Our" Crow...?

				LAO
		Come now.  You've seen the 
		graffiti -- all over the city in
		the few hors it has taken your
		men to drop like plague victims.
		What about your turf, Top?
			(mockingly)
		You don't seem to have ripped out
		anyone's heart yet.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(pissed off)
		The night is young.

				SKANK
			(hot)
		The found T-bird flash-fried to
		what was left of his fucking car!

	Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes
	to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,
	that really torques him off.

	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

	A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
	condemned building right across the street.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's
		against the law!

	His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

				TOP DOLLAR (CONT'D)
		I don't give a shit what kinda
		bird this guy is.

	EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

	As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the
	chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,
	perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
	until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

	LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his
	time being frittered.

				LAO
		I am sitting over here.

	He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top
	looks sheepish.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Do you think this childish
		machismo impresses me?
			(regains composure)
		When I was a boy in Saigon I
		watched my country change one 
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.  Whole lives erased.  A
		way of life, polluted.  Today, no 
		one forces me to move.  I use my
		powers to change your country, one
		block at a time,  one building at
		a time.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Nice speech.  What's it supposed
		to mean?

				LAO
		Your comprehension is not
		required.  Your cooperation and,
		indeed, your ability are the
		issues on the table.

	Top rallies to this.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Whatever you say, I can do.

	Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's
	guarantee.

				LAO
		That's reassuring.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

	from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE

	He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his
	hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

	ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

	Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

				SKANK
		What was that -- !?

	It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on
	his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel.

	ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR

	A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top.

	ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE

	Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from
	Skank's hand.  All react.  Weapons out.

	CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN

	spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand!

	GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS)

	Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward
	under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1.  He pivots, shooting,
	and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel
	door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The
	door is shut again.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

	Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao
	beneath the table for cover.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits
	the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits 
	across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing
	the lights.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

	springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field
	of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end.

	ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door
	opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way.

	ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO

	A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out.

	Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above
	frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.

				TOP DOLLAR
			(awed but maintained)
		You want my attention, man you
		got it.

	ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE

	Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.

				SKANK
		It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!

	ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE

				ERIC
		You have to be SKank.
			(to Top Dollar)
		One moment.

	As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming
	Skank by the hair.

				ERIC
		Thank of a snappy comeback for me
		on your way down.

	Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls
	all the way down.

	EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT

	Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
	and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
	flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.

				MJ
		OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!

	ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT

	who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
				ALBRECHT
		Jesus Christ...

	He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.

	INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT

	Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.

				ERIC
		Top Dollar, you're the only one
		here still wasting good air...

				TOP DOLLAR
		Five large, in the drawer right 
		over there.  I never saw you.

				ERIC
		Do you know what you destroyed?

				TOP DOLLAR
		Take the dope, too.

	Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

				ERIC
		A year ago.  A very nice lady
		circulated a petition.  She died.
		Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.

				TOP DOLLAR
		That's ancient history.

				ERIC
		It's yesterday!  Do you know what
		you destroyed?

	Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

				TOP DOLLAR
		Who gives a fuck!  I'm a
		businessman.  You gonna do me,
		then do me and shut you're face!

				ERIC
		You don't even remember...

				TOP DOLLAR
		I never forget anything, dickhead.
		That building was a sweep-and-
		clear; the bitch was a nuisance
		with her goddamned petition.  It
		got a little rowdy... end of
		story.

				ERIC
		Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps 
		for you.

	And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,
	slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

	FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,
	trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp.
	Eric winces, hard, and --

	FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild.

							FLASH ENDS.

	ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

	Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.

				ERIC
		You're a detail man, Top -- you
		need to see more.

	This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good.

	FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, 
	hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light.

	Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

							FLASH ENDS.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR

	arching, stiffening in pain.

	CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC

				ERIC
		All of her pain, Top.  Thirty
		hours.  All at once...

	Eric bears down on Top Dollar again.  Top screams.  Blood begins
	to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		...all for you.

	FLASH:  Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS.  A jagged compound fracture,
	jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken.

	Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air.  Icebox lighting.  A TIGHT
	SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee...

	TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR.

	as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead
	eyes.  Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.

				ERIC
		I didn't think you could handle it
		either.

	O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door.  Eric turns.

	ANGLE - STEEL DOOR

	as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram.
	All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.

				LEAD SWAT
		That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You
		stand down now, and that's an
		order!

	ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES

	using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the 
	incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping
	toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open
	fire on command.  Bullets tear the room to pieces.

				LEAD SWAT
		The fire escape's covered.

	EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
	him.  Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
	Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

	ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE

	Eric somersaults over.  Bullets chip brick in his wake.

	STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.

	Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
	shadow figure above.  Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

				TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
		On the roof!  Keep firing!  Keep
		firing!

	A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.

	RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE

	A forearm up against the fusillade.  Below him --

	ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE 

	Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP

	Eric runs for it.  Half a story higher.  He hits the wall and
	skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.

	ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.

	Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

				LEAD SWAT
		Holy shit, it's spiderman.

	He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

				LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
		What're you boy scouts staring at!
		Let's Go!  Let's go!  Let's go!

	MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF

	He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
	As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in 
	from behind and above the row of buildings.

	MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW

	COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to 
	Eric, trying to keep up.

	ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER

	PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof
	as well.

	WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.

	and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building.

	ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

	staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful
	moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.

	ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF

	sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at 
	them... then jumps.

				CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
		He's off the roof.  We can't see
		him.

	CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT

	pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.  

				LEAD SWAT
		Dammit to hell!
			(beat; to men)
		Come on.

	ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL

	Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's 
	okay, up and running.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY

	as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a 
	stop, blocking the exit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

	as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.

				ALBRECHT
			(from car)
		Come on!

	CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR

	We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.

	INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

	Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

				ALBRECHT
		Keep your head down!

	He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.  

	Gradually he calms down.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		I figured you might need a ride 
		home.

	Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

				ERIC
		It's done.
				ALBRECHT
		I figured as much.  Did you cap
		off Funboy.

				ERIC
		Funboy had to leave this mortal 
		coil.

				ALBRECHT
		Yeah, among others.
			(sees Eric's condition)
		Hey, man -- you're hit.

				ERIC
		It's only a flesh wound.

				ALBRECHT
		It's only fourteen or fifteen 
		flesh wounds.

	Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out 
	of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

				ERIC
		You shouldn't smoke these.

	He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

				ALBRECHT
		Great.  Litterbug of the Living
		Dead.

	Eric turns back to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		I'm finished.

	Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I mean, I've done what I came to
		do.  It shouldn't hurt this much.
		But it will pass...

				ALBRECHT
			(not buying it)
		Right.
			(beat)
		You sure I can't just take you to 
		the emergency ward?

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

	It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

				ERIC (O.S.)
		They couldn't do anything for me.

				ALBRECHT (O.S.)
		How 'bout the morgue?

				ERIC (O.S.)
		No.  I have one more thing to do.

	EXT. STREET - ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - NIGHT

	Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

	ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING

				ALBRECHT
		You're gonna kill somebody else.
			(beat; no response)
		We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
		of Band-Aids?

	Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
	His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
	lot out of him.  He needs to recharge.

				ERIC
		I have to prepare for an 
		anniversary.  This coming night.

	HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY

	High blue sky.  It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.

	INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY

	The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of
	various performers -- including Diabolique.  On several screens,
	one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven
	FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from
	the corridor gallery.  He places it within eyeshot and resumes
	work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other
	scattered research and inconcubula.

	ANGLE - GRANGE

	Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,
	he DRAWS BACK.

				GRANGE
		What... the hell is that?

				LAO
			(calmly)
		This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes,
		it is real.

	NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

	Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in
	his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

				GRANGE
		That thing is poisonous.

				LAO
		Extremely so.
			(beat)
		You and I are the recipients of
		unwanted good fortune, in the form 
		of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

	Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

				GRANGE
		Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...

				LAO
		I intend no slight to you, but I
		cannot find the English to
		adequately express just what he
		is.  I suppose Western mythology
		would describe him as a Fury.
		
				GRANGE
		Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.

	Lao chuckles indulgently.

				LAO
		Do you know of spirit assassins?
		You do know the dead can rise?
		Properly motivated, of course.

				GRANGE
		Like some sort of zombie on a 
		revenge trip.

				LAO
		Mmm.  But tonight I can take what
		is his.

				GRANGE
		Only thing you'll get from that
		clown is a faster way to die.
				LAO
		To the contrary...

	ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
	the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.
	He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes
	like a dark pimento.

	LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.
	Off Grange's stunned expression.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		...all the dying tonight will be 
		done by the former Eric Draven.

	Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Who is only invulnerable so long
		as he cares about the dead.  When
		he begins to care about the living,
		you'll find his heart can bleed...
		and I want it to bleed for me.

				GRANGE
		Kill a dead guy?

	Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

				LAO
		Truly kill him.  So I may crush
		his skull and smoke it.

	Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Let it suffice that I need him...
		and to get to him, we'll need his 
		little friend.

	Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand. 

	INT. LOFT - DAY

	Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood
	but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring
	fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could
	find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,
	photos of himself and Shelly.

	INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

	Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS
	cautiously inside.

	RESUME ERIC

	Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

				ELLY
		What's going on...?

				ERIC
		A remembrance.
			(beat)
		A closure.

	And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

	Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:
	Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

	He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

				ERIC
		Better now.  I feel good.  How are
		you, Elly, my friend?

	Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see 
	Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

				ERIC
		What is it?
				ELLY
		I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even
		with the makeup and stuff you
		wore.
			(beat)
		You really loved her, didn't you?

	CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

	The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

				ERIC
		You brought flowers.  As long as 
		you don't forget her, Elly, she 
		lives.

				ELLY
			(upset)
		She's dead.  She's gone.  And now
		you're just gonna go away and
		never come back, too.  I hate this
		place; it isn't fair.

				ERIC
		Elly...

	He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Sometimes the people we care about
		are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes
		that's really tough.  I cry.  But if 
		the people we love are gone, we keep them --

	He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		-- right here.  It's a big
		responsibility.  And that makes it 
		okay to mourn.
			(beat)
		I know that if you weren't here,
		I'd be very sad.

	Elly gives Eric a hug.

				ELLY
		You look funny without your white
		face on.  Like it's your day off
		or something.

	He quizzical expression amuses him.

				ERIC
		Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?

	Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.  
	Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.
		
				ELLY
		I remember him!  Here, Gabriel...
		here kitty... Gabriel... Is he
		still yours?

				ERIC
		I think he's yours, now.

	The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in
	her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

	While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last
	bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and 
	creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,
	then turns to Elly.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		I have something else for you.

	BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's
	inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

				ELLY
		Nobody ever gave me something like
		that before.  Ever.

	Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

				ERIC
		Shelly would've wanted you to have
		it.  This way, you'll think of her 
		every time you see it...

				ELLY
		And she'll be alive.  Up here.

	Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the
	ring.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches,
	demons out for Halloween.

	ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

	walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A
	fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

	ANGLE - ELLY ON BROWNSTONE STEPS

	Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

				ELLY
		You're gonna like it here.

	A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.

	ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR

	as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but
	jittery.  Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her
	arms.

				DARLA
		I was wonderin' where you'd
		gotten to --
			(she sees Gabriel)
		Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?

				ELLY
		He was a present.  Besides, we're
		moving anyway.  You said.

				DARLA
		We'll discuss this later.
		Obviously.  You left the door open.

	DARLA points.  As Elly goes to close the door it opens.

	NEW ANGLE - FAVOR THE DOOR

	Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts STRONGARMS
	(Lao Guards #3 & #4).  Grange looks around, bemused, his manner
	avuncular.

				GRANGE
		Hi, Elly.  Remember me?

	Elly's surprise is evident.  Darla is just plain pissed off.

				DARLA
		I don't remember you.  And I don't
		remember inviting...

				GRANGE
			(to his MEN)
		If she opens her face again, shoot
		her in the head.

	ANGLE - DARLA

	Mouth stalling in the ON position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a 
	gigantic gun, draws and cocks.

				ELLY

		Mom -- !

	ANGLE - GUARD #4 AND ELLY

	as he scoops her up, captive.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AND GABRIEL

	He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window.

				GRANGE
		You should listen to your mother.
		She said no cats.

	Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.

				ELLY
		Gabriel!

	Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.

				GRANGE
		Now that's the expression I want.

	ANGLE - ELLY AND GUARD #4

	As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to
	snap his shot.

				GRANGE (CONT'D)
		Say cheese.

	He snaps.  On the SX-70 WHIRR and flash white-out, we --

	EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET

	Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays
	the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.  Where
	before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
	heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a
	sense of homecoming.

	As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
	the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it 
	down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

	ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET

	as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

	INT. LOFT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DUSK

	As Eric comes down the stairs.  Notices the open door.

	INT. LOFT - DUSK

	He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle
	of the floor.  He opens it.

	INSERT - THE POLAROID OF ELLY

	with a note.

	UP ANGLE AT ERIC READING THE NOTE - FROM FLOOR

	The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens.

	NEW ANGLE -  A MOMENT LATER - FAST AND HARD

	Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape.

	ANGLE - ERIC DRESSING

	Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight.

	ANGLE - THE VANITY

	as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white
	makeup and smears it on.

							SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
	to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around
	him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder.

	ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE

	Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.

	ANGLE - ERIC WALKING

	A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its
	wake and crosses over to --

	MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY

	waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence,
	in the distance, the church looms.

	ANGLE - ERIC

	He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
	comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.

				CREATURE KID
		Trick or treat!

	Eric smiles.  Not tonight.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
	He holds for a moment then moves on.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow
	flaps past, leading him.

	NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As
	Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
	Eric and the huge double doors.

	Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy
	extends a skeletal hand.  STOP.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Stop screwing around.

	TIGHT ON ERIC

	Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me?

				SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
		Your job is done.  You interfere
		with the living again.

				ERIC
		Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I 
		might die.
			(beat)
		I've already done that.  I don't 
		need anyone's help.  Yours 
		included.

	STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY

	Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Do this thing and you will be
		vulnerable.  The blood will not
		return.
			(beat)
		No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.

				ERIC
		Fine with me.

	He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.

				SKULL COWBOY
		You'll be alone.

				ERIC
		I'm already alone.

	INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's
	arrival.  He speaks into a headset.

				GRANGE
		We've got company.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		Is he inside?

	GRANGE'S POV - ERIC

	Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie.

	RESUME GRANGE

	As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted
	sniper's rifle.

				GRANGE
		He's just out front talking to
		himself.  You tell me. 

	EXT. CHURCH - RESUMING ERIC ON STEPS - NIGHT

	Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.

				ERIC
		Don't waste my time.

				SKULL COWBOY
		Very well, it's your ass.

	And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.

	ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)

	As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
	disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat
	flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to
	disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
	mid-air.

	ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
	development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face 
	and transmutes to dust!

	RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)

	Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
	mentor
	CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND

	Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
	heart would have been.

	TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS

	He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
	renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that
	dies.  And as he looks to the sky --

	UP ANGLE - THE CROW

	flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished.

				ERIC
		But why are you still here?

	CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

	No answer in the crow's eyes.

	RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC

	That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and
	shoves them back.

	INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT

	The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the
	disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A
	giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static.

	LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION")

	Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places.

	ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME

	Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron
	ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the
	church.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		I believe our friend Elly call
		you Mister Crow.
			(beat)
		Please acknowledge; the mike
		will pick you up.
		
				ERIC
		I can see her.

				LAO
		Of course you can.
	ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running
	lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which
	THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.

				LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED)
		Don't permit your rage to cloud
		the issue.  I believe in barter.
		I propose a simple trade.

	Grange sights his weapon.

	CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER

	Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur
	FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of
	a giant stained glass window.

	NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots.

	ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in
	some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass.

	ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

	ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION")

	SPinning and hissing venomously.

	ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS

	As before, but the crow is not as fast.

	TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

	As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers.

	LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV

	His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		You intended to finish this
		evening in the cemetery.  I am 
		here to help you on your way.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY

	Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly 
	scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light.

	HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER

	Groping for support to drag himself back to standing.

				GRANGE (O.S.)
		I've got him if you want him.

				LAO (O.S./FILTERED)
		No shooting.

				GRANGE
			(into headset)
		Move in, guys.

	HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move
	into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle.
	Both wield calico's and one bears a sword.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow
	wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit.
	Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.

				LAO
		I wish to possess what you have now.

				ERIC
		I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

				LAO
		I know.  That is why I will
		prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?

	Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.

	ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

	Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart
	from the its body.

	ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER

	Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to
	breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.

				LAO
		Sooner or later, my action were
		destined to bring me a genuine
		Fury.  And it turned out to be you.
		At last.  I appreciate your
		abilities as few mortals can.
		That's why I desire them.

				ERIC
		You're too late.  There was a guy
		outside - on the stairs - you
		really need to talk to.  But he 
		turned to dust and blew away.
			(beat, gasping)
		I don't have any power for you to take.

				LAO
		I don't believe that.
	Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES
	his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may
	perceive a palpable degree of relief.

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Time for you to die for me.
			 (beat)
		Funny, how the dead can still
		bleed.  How they need air.

	Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange:

				LAO (CONT'D)
		Break its neck.

	ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on
	the bird.

	Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first
	dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through 
	the hole.

	EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT

	Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
	simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
	himself.

				ALBRECHT
		Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
		shit, didn't you, my friend.

	It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the 
	sky.

				ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
		Give it a rest, huh?

	A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on
	full auto into the Madonna on the window.

	INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT

	As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from
	behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping
	weakly.

	LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos,
	RETURNING FIRE.

	EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
	destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window
	continue to disintegrate. 

	INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)

	Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, 
	screaming.

				LAO
		I said no shooting!

	Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through
	the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs.

	The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter
	and EXITS whence he came.

	TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with
	the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.
	Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs
	back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

	TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward
	before he can fire.

	INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard
	changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

	ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his 
	gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

	RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,
	but not before he puts a round through Eric.

	Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.  

	RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine
	gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

	ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht
	dead-bang in the open by the window.

	MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword
	flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

	TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of
	something AIRBORNE toward him.

	CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s
	HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating
	strike.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the
	background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

	WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn
	apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

				ALBRECHT
		You sorta looked like you might
		need my help.

				ERIC
		This isn't your place.  This isn't
		your fight.  And I don't need
		your help.

				ALBRECHT
		You're welcome.

				ERIC
		Leave here.  Don't do this.  I
		don't want you here.

				ALBRECHT
		The hell you say.  This isn't just 
		about you any more.

	Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's 
	sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who
	pursues Eric to: 

	INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

	The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick
	bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

				ERIC
		Don't interfere.

				ALBRECHT
		You're bleeding, man.  You can't
		make it.

	Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

	ON ALBRECHT

	Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

				ALBRECHT
		You won't mind if I just take the
		stairs, then, smartass...

	He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the
	steps.

	ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of
	speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

	EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

	Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid
	clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

				ERIC
		Here I am.

	DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,
	Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell
	tower.

	SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly
	flinches at the strike.

				LAO
		Can you fly, Crow man?

	INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

	He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

				ALBRECHT
		I ain't cut out for this superhero
		shit.

	EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

	Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning
	rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
	roof, his blade brandished.

	CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
	weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
	and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

	Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
	FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

	ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
	roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
	The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
	that DUMPS Lao.

	Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
	similarly saves himself.

	NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
	the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
	rod and tries to wrest it loose.

	SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
	blue-hot.

	MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
	closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

	Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
	The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
	handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

	ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
	lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
	the roof.

	With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
	on to Eric.

	UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
	the sword.

				LAO
		Face me!

	Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
	When he looks up, Lao is gone.

	ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
	around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

				ALBRECHT
		Is he dead yet?

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
	gun quickly.

	ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

				LAO
		No.  You are.

	He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

	CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

	INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
	trailing sparks, snuffing out.

	ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
	night above him.

	ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
				LAO
		You've caused another death,

		as well -- because of you!

	ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

	The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

				ELLY
		You go to hell, you pervert!

	RESUME ERIC

	Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
	hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

				ERIC
		And how many lives have you destroyed?

				LAO
		I took yours from you.  Your
		little girlfriend?  I took hers,
		too.  Your meaningless, petty
		life?  I took it so that tonight
		your existence might gain a
		purpose.  You're no avenger.
		You're mine.

	PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

	Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

				ERIC
			 (to himself)
		You're right, I'm not an avenger. 
		Not any more.

	As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

	HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

	SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

	ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

	As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

	CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
	Pecking out Lao's eyes.

	WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
	climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

	RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
	down the roof - toward Eric.
	SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
	fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

				ERIC
		Time for a sacrifice.

	Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
	eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

				LAO
		I don't need eyes to take what I
		want from you.

	He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
	back!

	ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
	sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

				ERIC
		Can you fly?

	He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
	TIGHT.

	MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

	Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
	INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
	the killing blade still embedded in him!

	WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
	position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
	blade in his own chest.

	CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

	RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
	roof edge.

	ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
	is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
	shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

	ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
	to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

				ELLY
		Don't let me fall!

	CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

	A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

	Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
	limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
	the flowers there.

	Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

				ELLY
		Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

				ERIC
		In a better place.  I hope.

				ELLY
		You're not gonna come back, are you?

	Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
	her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
	it up to her.

				ERIC
		I don't know if I can.  But you
		have this... and you know where to come.

				ELLY
		You mean you'll, like' dig your way
		out of the grave?  Euww.

	Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

	He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
	her on the forehead.

				ERIC
		For you, I'll try.  Promise.

	MOVE WITH ERIC

	Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
	going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

	His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
	groping hand tries to drag him further.

				ERIC
		Leave me now.

	ANGLE - ELLY

	Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
	the flowers on Shelly's grave.

	ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

	Still too far away to matter.

	RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

	He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
	before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

	No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
	blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

	ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

	She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
	wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
	toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

	ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

	Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
	undisturbed  earth there.

	HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

	Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

	LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

	She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

	A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
	her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
	notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
	sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
	B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
	hectic but natural.

				DARLA
		Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new
		job, gotta go.

	This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

				DARLA (CONT'D)
		You sure you're gonna be okay?

	Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

	ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

	The aforementioned grey day in the city.

	ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

	Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
	more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
	clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
	Elly, out the window.

				DARLA
		At least it finally stopped
		raining.

				ELLY
		It can't rain all the time.

	Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
	her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

	ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

	Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
	Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

	EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

	An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
	INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
	crow.  Watching.  Waiting.

1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1

     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.

2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2

     A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus. We've been at this for six
               months.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               And you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
                    (not looking up)
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               But you said you have the worst
               reputation.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't you want to change that?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Let me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I think that's all the time we have
               for today.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Same time next week?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No. This is going to be our last
               session.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               He was a coke addict, you know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It works a little.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No it doesn't. I see right through you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You do?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               My daughter, Rachel.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yummy.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really? Care to make a wager on that?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Good luck, Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, nervous I'm going to win?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Would you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Rachel, it's mom.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

3    INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                3

     RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk,
     crying while holding the phone.

                              RACHEL
               Hi, mom.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Honey, is something wrong?

     Rachel cries for a moment.

                              RACHEL
               He told me he loved me and I believed
               him.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Who told you?

                              RACHEL
               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

     She continues to cry.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep
               breath, and step out of the circle.

                              RACHEL
               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
               mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

     WE PAN OVER TO HER COMPUTER CONSOLE. CLOSE ON: COMPUTER
     MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League
     Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to
     a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her
     privates.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               What kind of pictures?

                              RACHEL
               Nudie pictures, what do you think?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus Christ, how can you be so
               stupid?

                              RACHEL
               I don't know. He was just so charming.
               All he did was talk about how I had
               killer legs and how we wanted to
               photograph them. Things just got out
               of hand from there.
                    (she hears the phone drop)
               Mom? Are you there? Mom?
                    (screaming)
               Mother!!!!

4    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY           4

     Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots
     Sebastian standing in the elevator.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You son of a bitch.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Fuck off, Harold.

     He gasps.

5    EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               5

     A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
     pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red
     zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the
     steps to the townhouse.

                              METER MAID
               You can't park there.

     Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.

6    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                     6

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     CLOSE ON:  A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher
     knife comes down on the tuna cutting it's head off.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice
     roll.

7    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     7

     CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi
     through several doors until we enter the final door
     leading into -

8    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 8

     A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a
     view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around
     the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel.

     SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi
     in front of -

     KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain
     skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an
     East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her
     face and listens attentively as -

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful
     teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt
     with a Koala Bear on it.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't tell you how happy we are that
               Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
               this fall. You've always been an
               inspiration to Beau and I on raising
               her. We just hope she can rise to the
               high standards which you've set for
               her.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll do my best.

     Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese)
               Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be
               all.

     Sook-Hee leaves.

                              CECILE
               What was that?

                              KATHRYN
               I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a
               beautiful language.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Kathryn is a straight A student at
               Oakwood as well as being President of
               the French Club. Listen to whatever
               she has to say and you'll go far.

                              KATHRYN
                    (in French)
               You're too kind.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring
               that goes on in high school. Where
               do you get your strength?

                              KATHRYN
               I know this sounds corny, but whenever
               I feel temptations of peer pressure,
               I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to God and he helps me through the
               problem. Call me an anachronism, but
               it works.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               That's beautiful.

                              CECILE
               What are the boys like?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile, is that the best you can do?
                    (to Kathryn)
               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I hear she's recovering quite well.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               You remember my daughter, Cecile.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My, what an adorable shirt you're
               wearing.

                              CECILE
               My father just took me on a trip to Australia.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              CECILE
               What year are you in?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

                              CECILE
               But I thought high school is only four years.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.

     He winks at Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I think we'll be going now.
                    (to Kathryn)
               Thanks for all your help.

     Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll call you later and we'll get together
               and plan your curriculum.

                              CECILE
               Thanks.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Nice meeting you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ciao.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash
               and her stupid daughter are doing in my
               house?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               The parental units called while you were out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?

                              KATHRYN
               Hopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
               going well?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was fine.

     He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
               Manhattan Debutantes.

     He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nothing shocks them anymore.

     He scratches the nude's pubic area.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
               touch.

     He kisses it.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have
               a mission for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

9    EXT. PARK - DAY                                            9

     COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears
     a Polo sweater with an American Flag.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
               Reynolds?

     Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing
     the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes
     up her hair.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth
               Of July Weekend?

10   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 10

     Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.

                              KATHRYN
               He didn't dump me. We had a parting of
               the ways.

     Sebastian stares her down.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright he dumped me.

     He smiles, then swallows the sushi.

11   EXT. PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE/INT. COURT' S CAR - NIGHT       11

     A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final
     swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.

                              KATMRYN (V.O.)
               I went to great lengths to please Court.
               Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
               keep him happy.

     Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.

                              SEBASTIAN(V.O.)
               Swallow?

     She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               What do you think?

     Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Sorry.

12   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 12

                              KATHRYN
               In any event, my feelings were hurt when I
               learned that he had fallen for someone else.
               Someone chaste... pure... innocent.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't mean?

13   EXT. PARK - DAY                                            13

     Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop
     ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               None other than Cecile Caldwell.

     She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone.
     She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet

14   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 14

     Sebastian snickers.

                              KATHRYN
               I don't find this very funny,

                              SEBASTIAN
               So that's what this is all about.
                    (imitating Kathryn)
               We'll get together and plan your
               curriculum.

                              KATHRYN
               Keep your friends close and your
               enemies closer. When I get through
               with her, she'll be the premier Blow
               Job Queen of the Tri-State area and
               poor little Court's heart will be
               shattered.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why go through Cecile? Why not just
               attack Court?

                              KATHRYN
               Because if there's an attack made on
               Court it could be traced back to me.
               I can't allow that to happen.
               Everybody loves me and I intend to
               keep it that way.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I see your point... though why should
               I care?

                              KATHRYN
               I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
               Introduce her to your world of
               decadence and debauchery.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sounds intriguing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's quite cute you know. Young
               supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
               an uncharted pootie.

     Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his
     lips.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
               Boldly go where no man has gone
               before.

     Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues
     to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't.

     Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.

                              KATHRYN
               Why not?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
               "But I thought high school was only
               four years." I mean, please. She knows
               nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
               have her under the table at Au Bar
               sucking me off before the appetizer
               arrived. Go get one of those moron
               friends of yours to do it. I have a
               reputation to uphold.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh but diddling the therapist's
               daughter is a challenge?

                              SEBASTIAN
               That was just simple revenge. What I
               have planned requires sheer genius.

     He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."

                              KATHRYN
               I'm not interested in the latest dating
               tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up and turn to page 64.

     She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title
     reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait
     Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas
     City, Missouri.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus Christ, is she for real?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes. I've read it over and over again.
               This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little
               angel. A paradigm of chastity and
               virtue.

                              KATHRYN
               B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
               Kansas and woo little Dorothy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It just so happens we're not in Kansas
               anymore. Our little angel's father has
               accepted the new headmaster position at
               Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
               in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
               house. Can you imagine what this would
               do for my reputation? Screwing the new
               headmaster's virginal daughter before
               school starts? It will be my greatest
               victory.

                              KATHRYN
               You don't stand a chance. Even this is
               out of your league.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Care to make a wager on that?

                              KATHRYN
               I'll think about it...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
               chapter to my work of art.

     He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more
               queer?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Could you be more desperate to read it?

     Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh Sebastian. About that little wager
               of yours.

     He stops.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Count me in.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are the terms?

                              KATHRYN
               If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
               of yours is mine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And if I win?

     She approaches him.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll give you something you've been
               jerking off about ever since our parents
               got married.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Be more specific.

                              KATHRYN
               In English.
                    (whispers in his ear)
               I'll fuck your brains out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What makes you think I'd go for that
               bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
               car.

                              KATHRYN
               Because I'm the only person you can't
               control and it kills you.

     Sebastian sneers at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Do we have a deal?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No way, that car means everything to
               me.

     She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.

                              KATHRYN
                    (whispering)
               You can put it anywhere.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Even there?

                              KATHRYN
                    (baby talk)
               It would feel so yummy.

     Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Happy hunting.

15   EXT. ROSEMOND ESTATE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   15

     WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and
     stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE.
     Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.

16   EXT. ESTATE - MEADOW - DAY                                 16

     ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
     seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt.
     The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl.
     The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.

                              ANNETTE
               It's a beautiful home you have here
               Mrs. Rosemond.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
               with my family for over sixty years.
               Does your family do much riding?

                              ANNETTE
               My mother and I used to ride a lot,
               before she got sick.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
               farm so I would come over and ride all
               the time.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in
               the mid-west. What's his name?

                              ANNETTE
               Ben Schwarz.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Schwarz. Jewish?

                              ANNETTE
               German.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Doesn't ring a bell.

     Annette throws her a concerned look.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               In any event, I want you to consider
               this your home for the time being.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet
               around here.

     BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What was that?

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian must be here.

     Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.

17   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 17

     Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper,
     FRANKLIN stands by the trap.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pull!

     The TARGET soars into the air,

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Die motherfucker!

     He fires the gun, missing the target.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shit, shit, shit.

     Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian
     perks up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Kitty. Kitty.

     He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
     again. Sebastian searches for the cat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.

     He raises his rifle and takes aim.

                              AUNT HELEN (O.S.)
               Sebastian!

     He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and
     Annette riding over to him. He waves.

     Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I've been looking all over for you.
               God, I've missed you.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I've missed you too. How are your
               parents?

                              SEBASTIAN
               They're coming back next week. I write
               them everyday.

     She strokes his cheek, lovingly.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
               She's going to be staying with me for
               a few weeks.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.

     He extends his hand and they shake.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (to Aunt Helen)
               Why don't you head in and whip us up
               some of that ice tea of yours? We'll
               take care of the horses.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Anything for you, my dear.

     Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               Stay out of trouble you two.

                              SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE
               We will.

     He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.

18   INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18

     Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.

                              SEBASTIAN
               So what year are you going into?

                              ANNETTE
               Junior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Got a boyfriend back home?

                              ANNETTE
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't know. Relationships seem too
               distracting. I'd rather concentrate on
               my studies.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You a lesbo?

                              ANNETTE
                    (annoyed)
               No.

     She bends over to pick up the saddle.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nice.

     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.

                              ANNETTE
               Are you often this offensive on a first
               encounter?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just being honest. You happen to
               have a nice ass. Sorry.

     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I read your teen beat manifesto.

                              ANNETTE
               You did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I must say I found it rather appalling.

                              ANNETTE
               That's a first. Most people praised me
               for it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Most people are morons. I mean who are
               you to knock what you've never experienced?

                              ANNETTE
               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
               belief that people shouldn't actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh really?

                              ANNETTE
               Take yourself. You've slept with several
               women. Are you happier because of it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               How do you know I've been with several
               women?

                              ANNETTE
               A friend wrote me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pissed)
               Well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
               but you still didn't answer the question.

     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who the hell is taking the time to write
               letters, spreading this shit about me?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not really important.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
               not going to be friends.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you being so dramatic?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
               trying to deal with them and the last
               thing I need is people spreading shit
               about me.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright, I said I was sorry.
                    (beat)
               Can we start over again? I think we've
               gotten off on the wrong foot.

     She approaches him and they shake.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Annette Harrison.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian Valmont.

     She smiles, but before he releases her hand:

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since
               you've never had sex do you touch
               yourself?

     She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What did I say?

19   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      19

     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.

                              RONALD (O.S.)
               That's good, that's good.

     WE PULL BACK

     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
     music lesson.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now let's try the A minor scale.

     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.

     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Once more, and remember the third note
               is flat.

     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.

                              CECILE
               Oh, I suck. I suck.

                              RONALD
               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

     Cecile takes a deep breath

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               You're concentrating too much on your
               bowing. Let it flow.

     He stands and sits behind her.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Here, let me help you.

     He places his hand over hers.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and let's try again.

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
               Your playing was beautiful.

     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile

                              CECILE
               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
               giving me music lessons over the
               summer.

     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.

                              RONALD
               Pleased to meet you.

                              KATHRYN
               Likewise I'm sure.

                              CECILE
               Ronald is one of the few high school
               students attending Juliard. He's
               composing his first opera.

                              RONALD
               It's based on the life of Doctor
               Martin Luther King.

                              CECILE
               Doctor King is my favorite.

     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.

                              RONALD
               I guess our hour's up. Same time
               tomorrow?

     Cecile nods.

20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20

     Another nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is
     parked outside.

21   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                        21

     A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine
     to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art.

     BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and
     open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds
     from his stash.

     Sebastian paces behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -

                              BLAINE
               - none taken -

                              SEBASTIAN
               - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
               shit about me.

                              BLAINE
               Any ideas who it could be?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
               wouldn't be alive right now.

                              BLAINE
               Where did you say she's from?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

                              BLAINE
               Greg McConnell.

                              SEBASTIAN
               The football stud?

                              BLAINE
               He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
               surprised if he was your rat.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
               I fingered his girlfriend at the game
               last year.

                              BLAINE
               I don't think that bothered him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you mean?

                              BLAINE
               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
               ends on and off the field.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you shitting me?

                              BLAINE
               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
               go at it for a while, then as soon as
               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
               know -
                    (imitating Greg)
               "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
               I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
                    (beat)
               It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
               gay, deal with it. The only reason why
               I let him continue with his charade is
               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

                              BLAINE
               Not anymore. Football team started
               practice last week. He's already called
               me to hook up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really. You think you could arrange a
               little get together with him tonight on
               my behalf?

                              BLAINE
               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
               Spartacus on television tonight.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              BLAINE
               Don't think it's not going to cost you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No problem. Just make sure your front
               door is unlocked. Shall we say the
               "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?

     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.

22   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                    22

     Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
     around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
     a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
     Cecile and braids her hair.

                              KATHRYN
               So, rumor has it that you went on a date
               with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
               nice.

                              CECILE
               He's alright.
                    (giggles)
               He kept talking about this bulimic
               headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.

                              KATHRYN
               Really? Bulimic headcase.

                              CECILE
               What a loser she must be.
                    (beat)
               Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
               for Labor Day Weekend.

                              KATHRYN
               That's great.

                              CECILE
               You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
               just scared.

                              KATHRYN
               What are you scared of?

                              CECILE
               Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
               first base with a guy. What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               Haven't you ever practiced with one of
               your girlfriends?

                              CECILE
               Eww. No. That's gross.

                              KATHRYN
               It's not gross. How else do you think
               girls learn? Here turn around and
               face me.

     Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and wet your lips.

                              CECILE
               Are you for real?

                              KATHRYN
               Do you want to learn or not?

                              CECILE
               I guess. It still sounds gross.

     Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
     her on the mouth.

                              KATHRYN
               See that wasn't so bad.

                              CECILE
               It was nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               Let's try it again, only this time I'm
               going to stick my tongue in your
               mouth. When I do that I want you to
               massage my tongue with yours. That's
               what first base is.

                              CECILE
                    (reluctant)
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Eyes closed.

     Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
     again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
     then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
     as instructed and they start to make out.

     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
     continues her seduction.

     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.

     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
     and smile.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Not bad.

                              CECILE
               That was cool.

                              KATHRYN
               Maybe you should try it on your friend
               Ronald sometime.

                              CECILE
               What are you saying?

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
               you.

                              CECILE
               Is it that obvious?

     Kathryn nods.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               He sends me letters you know. Love
               letters.

                              KATHRYN
               That's so romantic. Have you
               responded?

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well do you like him?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, we just made out in the middle
               of Central Park. You can trust me.

                              CECILE
                    (beat)
               I do like him. I can't stop thinking
               about him.

     Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               What am I going to do? If my mother
               found out about Ronald she would kill
               me.

     Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.

                              KATHRYN
               Listen to me. Your mother must never
               know. Never.

                              CECILE
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you hide the letters?

                              CECILE
               Yes. They're in this antique doll house
               in my room.

                              KATHRYN
               I want you to make me copies of his
               letters and bring them to me.

                              CECILE
               Why?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
               at it's love letters. With my help,
               he'll be eating out of the palm of
               your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
               little get together for the two of you
               at my house.

                              CECILE
               You'd do that for me?

                              KATHRYN
               Of course I would. We're friends,
               right?

                              CECILE
               Best friends.

     Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

23   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 23

     Little touches of Annette's life (photo of dead mother)
     adorn the room. Annette is reading The Fountainhead when
     she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to
     concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony.

24   EXT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT                    24

     Annette steps onto the balcony.

     HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair
     sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and
     singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German.

                              ANNETTE
                    (calling out)
               Excuse me. Excuse me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You talking to me?

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I know this is your house and all,
               but do you think you couid keep it down?
               I'm trying to read.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What'cha reading?

                              ANNETTE
               The Fountainhead.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Great book.

                              ANNETTE
                    (skeptical)
               You've read The Fountainhead?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
               you know. When Howard Roark makes love
               to Dominique Francon... most romantic
               scene in all of literature.

                              ANNETTE
               Romantic? He rapes her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's a matter of opinion.

                              ANNETTE
               You need help.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why don't you come join me for a swim
               and we'll discuss it.

                              ANNETTE
               At this hour? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on. Quit acting like a
               geriatric and get in the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Gee, with an invitation like that how
               could a girl refuse.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Please.

                              ANNETTE
               Give me a minute. I'll be right down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you.

     She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone
     RINGS. He answers it.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

25   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         25

     Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small
     tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot.

                              KATHRYN
               Fuck her yet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm working on it.

                              KATHRYN
               Loser.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blow me.

                              KATHRYN
               Call me later.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay.

     She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently
     jabs her toe.

                              KATHRYN
               Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.

                              SOOK-HEE
               Sorry.

     Kathryn kicks some water in her face.

                              KATHRYN
               Oops.

26   EXT. ESTATE - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT                        26

     Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
     pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.

                              ANNETTE
                    (holding out the letter)
               You know it amazes me that someone as
               bright as you can be so horrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What? Another letter from your friend?

                              ANNETTE
               This is my favorite part.
                    (reading the letter)
               Even more treacherous and dangerous than
               he is charming and fascinating. He has
               never taken a single step or spoken a
               single word without some dishonorable
               or criminal intention. Every young girl
               he has successfully pursued has
               regretted it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know you could at least have the
               decency of telling me who's badmouthing
               me so I might have the opportunity to
               confront them face to face. How do you
               know it's not some girl who's pissed
               off at me for breaking up with her?

                              ANNETTE
               I sincerely doubt it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Give me the fucking letter.

     Annette smiles and tears the letter up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why did you do that?

                              ANNETTE
               The last thing I need is you going into
               my room searching for this while I'm
               away.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (mocking)
               Is that the last thing you need? My
               your clever.

     She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
     then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
     bathing suit underneath.

                              ANNETTE
               How's the water?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Refreshing.

     She dives in the pool and surfaces.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You're right you know.

                              ANNETTE
               About what?

                              SEBASTIAN
               About what you said today in the stable.
               I'm not a happy person.

                              ANNETTE
               I never said that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You implied it.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
               time.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
               with all your morals and values and
               well, YOU seem to be happy in your
               choices. I envy you. No bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
                    (caught off guard)
               Thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Seriously, you're amazing. You have
               everything going for you.
                    (counts with his fingers)
               You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
               determined. You're everything I want
               in a girlfriend.

                              ANNETTE
                    (jokingly)
               Shut up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
               out.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
               could never work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               Because you act like a pig.

     He swims towards her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you deny that there's an attraction
               between us?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't... I don't want to answer that...
               look we're friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't find me cute? Come on, look
               at these muscles.

     He flexes for her. She laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
               that.

     He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
     him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.

                              ANNETTE
               You're naked.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's my house.

     She pushes him off her.

                              ANNETTE
               That's repulsive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's the big deal? We're friends.
               Haven't you ever seen your friends
               naked before?

     Annette climbs out of the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Get some manners.

     She walks into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.

     She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail
               Mary's for you.
                    (beat)
               Good night.

27   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                27

     Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside.

28   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28

     Sebastian presses his ear to the door.

                              GREG (O.S.)
                    (moaning)
               Oh baby... oh baby...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Baby?
                    (checks his watch)
               Right on time.

29   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      29

     GREG McCONNELL, All-American star football player for
     Oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by Blaine,
     who lies under the covers.

                              GREG
                    (near orgasm)
               Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm
               gonna cum... I'm gonna...

     The door swings open and Sebastian enters.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy
               shit.

                              GREG
               Jesus!

     Greg throws the covers over his face. Sebastian smiles
     and sits. He lights a cigarette. No movement from under
     the covers.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Greg, is that you under the covers?

                              GREG
                    (from under the covers)
               Get out of here.

     Sebastian stands YANKS the covers off the bed, revealing
     Greg and Blaine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Whoa!

                              GREG
               I told you to lock the door.

                              BLAINE
               I thought I did.

                              GREG
               Look Valmont. This was the first time
               I've ever done something like this. I
               was --

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (apathetic)
               -- really drunk and blah blah blah
               blah blah.

                              GREG
               Please don't tell anyone. This could
               ruin my career.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Your career? What about your family?
               Can you imagine the humiliation your
               father's going to feel when he finds
               out his pride and joy is a fudge-
               packer.

                              BLAINE
               Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's
               not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes
               but not a fudge packer.

                              GREG
                    (to Sebastian)
               Please. I'm begging you. I'll do
               anything. Let's just forget the whole
               thing.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you
               there. It's too good to pass up.

     Greg starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               After all, it is you who's bad-
               mouthing me to Annette Harrison.

                              GREG
               Annette Harrison? I don't know what
               you're talking about.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come on Greg. You're the only one who
               knows her. The truth will save you.

                              GREG
                    (sobbing)
               I swear on my life, I never said a
               word to her about you.

                              BLAINE
               I think he's telling the truth
               Valmont. Greg couldn't write a
               grocery list let alone a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alright, I believe you. Stop crying.
               Your secret's safe with me.

     Greg wipes his eyes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               However, this whole incident's kind of
               turned me on.

     Sebastian unzips his fly.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You get my point.

     Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to
     Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles.

     Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when -

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Jesus Christ, I was only kidding.
               What do you think, I'm gay? My God,
               haven't you had enough for tonight.

                              BLAINE
               Our boy just can't get enough dick.

                              GREG
               You sick son of a bitch.

     Blaine and Sebastian laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave you guys alone.
                    (macho voice)
               Score one for the team, Greg.

     Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Come to think of it, there is
               something you can do for me.

30   EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY                                   30

     Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
     YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
     lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.

     Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
     her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need a lift?

                              ANNETTE
               No thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are you today?

                              ANNETTE
               Give it up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
               you an apology.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm not going to speak to you till you
               realize that you can't intimidate me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said I was sorry.

     She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice sleep last night?

                              ANNETTE
               It was fine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wish I could say the same for
               myself. I was up thinking about you
               all night.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought we agreed that we were going
               to be friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
               switch the "on" button to "off." The
               sad fact of the matter is that you've
               unintentionally rubbed off on me.

     Annette stops running and turns to him.

                              ANNETTE
               And that's a bad thing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm trying to better myself, but the
               one person who can help me is the same
               one pushing me away.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
               savior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well try this one on for size. I think
               I'm falling in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't even know me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't you believe in love at first sight?

                              ANNETTE
               Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
               is far from mutual.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
               time together this morning?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who?

                              ANNETTE
               That's none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How about tonight?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm busy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Doing what?

                              ANNETTE
               That's also none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
               win your heart. I'll do anything. I
               can't get you out of my mind.

                              ANNETTE
               You truly want to do something to make
               me happy?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               And you promise to abide by it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Without question.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright.
                    (beat)
               I want you to leave and go back to
               New York.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               If that's a problem, then I'll make
               arrangements to stay with some friends.

     Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about being happy. You and I
               can't -

     He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.

31   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           31

     Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the
     ocean.

                              GREG
               He told you he's failing in love
               with you? I've never known him to
               say those words before.

                              ANNETTE
               Really? I thought he said it all
               the time.

                              GREG
               That's not his style. one thing I can
               say about Valmont. He always speaks
               the truth.

     Annette looks lost.

                              GREG (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              ANNETTE
               Nothing.

                              GREG
               Is there a mutual feeling between you
               two?

                              ANNETTE
               No. I mean. I don't know.
                    (beat)
               What else do you know about him?

                              GREG
               Not a whole lot. We take some classes
               together. He's got a bad rep, but it's
               mostly bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
               What do you mean?

                              GREG
               Well, a lot of people are jealous cause
               he's loaded.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sighs)
               I don't know. I've been hearing some
               awful things about him.

                              GREG
               From who?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

     Greg takes her hand.

                              GREG
               Annette, how long have we known each
               other?

                              ANNETTE
               Forever.

                              GREG
               Now it's my job to look out for you.
               You're like a kid sister to me. Do I
               look like some kind of gossip queen?

     Annette laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               You promise not to say anything?

                              GREG
               On my mother's life.

                              ANNETTE

               Okay...

     Sebastian drives down the highway towards Manhattan. He holds
     his cell phone in one ear.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That nosey bitch. Are you sure?

     Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight.

                              GREG
               Positive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did you do everything I asked you to?

                              GREG
               Yes.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her I never said I love you
               before?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her that people are jealous
               cause I'm loaded?

               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               And you think she bought it?

                              GREG
               I'm pretty sure she did.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pretty sure or sure sure?

                              GREG
               She bought it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll be in touch.

     Click. The line goes dead.

34   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 34

     Kathryn is sitting in front of the television, scowling.

     ON TV - A HIDDEN VIDEO OF RONALD AND CECILE IN THE
     VALMONT LIVING ROOM.

     Ronald plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" at the piano
     while Cecile listens and sways to the music.

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM -

                              KATHRYN
               Enough with the music. Fuck her
               already.

     She throws a magazine at the television. Sebastian bursts
     into the living room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You would not believe what--

                              KATHRYN
               Shhh.

     ON TELEVISION - RONALD FINISHES THE SONG. CECILE STANDS
     AND APPLAUDS. RONALD TAKES A BOW.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               That was beautiful.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Almost as beautiful as you.

     Cecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Well, I guess it's getting late.
               Please thank Kathryn for the use of
               her Steinway.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               I'll see you tomorrow.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Absolutely.

     He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Idiot!

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image.

                              KATHRYN
               What's wrong with you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You ready for this? I've recently
               discovered that our good friend Mrs.
               Caldwell is the one who sent the
               letter to Annette urging her to stay
               away from me.

                              KATHRYN
               Interesting.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I now plan to devote all my energies to
               destroying the douche bag. Any luck
               corrupting her daughter?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Call Cecile up and get her to come over.
               I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.

     She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and
     Cecile on the television.

                              KATHRYN
               The plot thickens. It appears that
               Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love
               that.

                              KATHRYN
               Not to mention Court Reynolds.
               Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the
               speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's your plan of attack?

                              KATHRYN
               I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes
               ballistic and ends their relationship.
               Boo hoo.

                              SEBASTIAN
               But who will they turn to for help?

     Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile is planning to go away with Court
               next week. I'll need you to speed
               up her sexual awakenings.

     Sebastian rubs her shoulders.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm at your service.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh sis. You're so tense.

     Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra.
     He's met with no resistance.

                              KATHRYN
               I hate when things don't go my way. It
               makes me so horny.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I hate it too.

     He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her
     skirt.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (baby talk)
               Oh baby, your soaking.

                              KATHRYN
               I know.

     She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (seductively)
               Any luck with your girl?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Moving along quite well.

                              KATHRYN
               Have you succeeded in your task?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Any day now.

                              KATHRYN
               Well, let me know when you do. Until
               then.

     She takes his hand out from under her pants.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               No pootie.

     Kathryn smiles.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Sorry.

               Goodbye Mister Bond.

     He picks up the phone and dials.

                              ANNETTE
               No, not at all.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to see how
               you're doing.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm... I'm alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How was your date?

                              ANNETTE
               It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to tell you
               I was thinking about you and I miss
               you. I'll let you go.

                              ANNETTE
               Wait, don't hang up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay?

                              ANNETTE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Reading.

     He crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad
     twins (GRETCHEN & MORA) are licking popsicles.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you reading?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of Human Bondage.

                              ANNETTE
               Somerset Maugham.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering
               my situation.

                              ANNETTE
               You're not gonna start that again.

     He takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the
     girls' butts.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No. I'm through with my childish
               games when it comes to you. Hold on,
               that's my other line.
                    (to the girls)
               Rub.

     They rub the oil on each other then turn to him and
     smile. He clicks the phone back on.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette that's my mom calling. Can I
               call you tomorrow?

                              ANNETTE
               Sure. Have a good night.

               I will.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even
               know what it is.

                              GRETCHEN
               Duh, it's a book.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know what it's about?

                              MORA
               Who cares. Books are for fags.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Books are for fags. I weep for the

40   INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        40

     A SALESWOMAN approaches Kathryn who's checking out an
     assortment of fur coats. The saleswoman holds up a
     beautiful dress.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Here's something you might like.

     Kathryn examines the label.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you carry any real fur?

                              SALESWOMAN
               No. All our fur is faux.

                              KATHRYN
               Of course. The animals. How silly of
               me.

     The saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers
     then looks over at a small child, staring at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (mouthing the words)
               Fuck off.

     She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell
     approaches.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I got your message and came as quick
               as I could.

                              KATHRYN
               I hope I didn't keep you from
               something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Not at all. What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               What about her?

                              KATHRYN
               Well... you promise you won't say
               anything to her. We've developed a
               friendship and...

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't
               drugs is it?

                              KATHRYN
               It's worse. I think there's something
               going on between Cecile and her music
               teacher.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Ronald? That's crazy.

                              KATHRYN
               I know. She's so young and he's so -

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Black.

     Kathryn reacts to her remark.

                              KATHRYN
               He's been sending her love letters that
               she hides under her doll house. I
               questioned whether or not to tell you,
               but something like this could destroy
               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               I hope I did the right thing in telling
               you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things
               with Court.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't thank you enough.

                              KATHRYN
               You will be discreet about this?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Absolutely.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Will that be cash or charge?

     Kathryn looks through her purse.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.

     Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let me get that for you.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh please. I can't have you do that.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It's the least I can do.

     Mrs. Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman.
     Kathryn turns to Mrs. Caldwell.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you.

41   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      41

     Ronald gives Cecile a cello lesson when Mrs. Caldwell
     bursts into the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Who the hell do you think you are?!

                              RONALD
               Excuse me.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I'm paying you to give cello lessons.
               Not to pervert my child.

                              RONALD
               Mrs. Caldwell I think you're
               misunderstanding something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Is that so?

     Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               You care to explain this then?

     Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry.

                              CECILE
               Where did you find those?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Margarita found them while cleaning
               your room.

                              CECILE
               Those are my letters!

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Don't you raise your voice at me. Go
               to your room, now.

     Cecile turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Now!

     Ronald nods and Cecile runs out of the room. Mrs.
     Caldwell turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               How dare you treat me with such
               disrespect. I got you off the streets
               and this is how you repay me?

                              RONALD
               Got me off the streets? I live on
               59th and Park.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Whatever. You are never to set foot
               in this house again and you are never
               and I mean never to see my daughter
               again. Is that understood?!

     Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs. Caldwell
     waits.

                              RONALD
               First of all, maam, I never touched
               your daughter and second, I would like
               to think that in these times someone
               of your status could look beyond
               racial lines.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Oh don't give me any of that racist
               crap. My husband and I gave money to
               Colin Powell.

                              RONALD
                    (sarcastic)
               I guess that puts me in my place.
               Thank you for the hospitality Mrs.
               Caldwell. It was a true awakening.

     He storms off.

42   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - ELEVATOR - DAY                   42

     Ronald rides down in the elevator.

                              RONALD
                    (angry)
               Took me off the streets?

     The elevator stops and the doors open. Sebastian and
     Kathryn stand in the doorway, wearing shades. Kathryn
     hands Cecile's letter.

43   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         43

     Ronald sits in a chair and reads Cecile's letter.
     Sebastian and Kathryn watch.

                              RONALD
               Wow. I never knew she had these kind
               of feelings.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You're a lucky guy.

                              RONALD
                    (eyes tear up)
               She really loves me.

     Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               What do you do? Tell her you love
               her.

                              RONALD
               But I can't even see her. She doesn't
               have her own phone, I don't even know
               her e-mail address.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and
               pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her
               another letter.

                              RONALD
               How will I get to her?

                              SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN
               We'll make sure she gets it.

                              RONALD
               Why are you being so good to me?

                              KATHRYN
               Because we want to see Cecile happy
               and we know you make her happy.

     She hands Ronald a pen and paper.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now you just march yourself into the
               study and start writing. We'll be there
               to check on you in a minute.

     Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while
     Kathryn picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who are you calling?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile.

     Sebastian hangs up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Before we go through with this, I just
               want you to be aware of the damage we're
               going to cause.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm aware.

     She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you really? I mean, we've done some
               pretty fucked up shit in our time but
               this... I mean, we're destroying an
               innocent girl. You do realize that.

                              KATHRYN
               What is that? Oh my God, it's your
               conscience.

     She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful
     of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on
     it.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Court Renolds is going down and if you're
               not going to help me, someone else will.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You amaze me.

                              KATHRYN
               Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you
               to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl
               it's wrong. Well let me tell you
               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.
               Do you think I relish the fact that I
               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty
               four seven, so I can be considered a
               "laaaady." Do you think I take great
               delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so
               wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child."
               "Kathryn is going to make an excellent
               wife one day."
                    (beat)
               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the
               upper East Side and sometimes I want to
               kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy
               being a part of the weaker sex and for
               that reason everyone around me is going
               to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis
               Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you
               out?

     Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and
     dials.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright,
               stop crying. I understand. Hold on for
               Sebastian.

     She hands the phone to Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
               very carefully. I have a letter from
               Ronald that he asked me to give to
               you. Now I can't exactly bring it to
               your house, since your mother
               despises me so here's what we're going
               to do.

44   CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              44

     The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques
     and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile
     lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it,
     dressed in sweats.

45   MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT                                   45

     Cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting
     taxi.

46   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       46

     Cecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter
     while Sebastian fiddles with a camera.

                              CECILE
               Finished.

     She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Excellent.

                              CECILE
               You think he'll like it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               He'll love it.

     He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Just taking your photo.

                              CECILE
               I look terrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes
               don't do you justice. Why don't you
               take them off.

     Cecile gasps.

                              CECILE
               I'm getting out of here.

     She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry that was out of line.

                              CECILE
                    (scared)
               I want to go home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just kidding.

                              CECILE
                    (eyes watering)
               I want to go home.

     He moves toward the phone

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom
               and have her come pick you up.

                              CECILE
               My mom? Don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't 
               know you're here. In fact, you're
               grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
               shitload of trouble for this.
               I think I should call her anyway.

     Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms
     around his legs.

                              CECILE
               Please please please. I'll do
               anything. Just don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile, all I want to do is give you a
               kiss.

                              CECILE
               And then I can go home?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of course. I'm not a monster.

     Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her
     feet.

                              CECILE
               Just a kiss, right?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I swear.

     She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the
     string holding up her sweats and pulls it open.

     Cecile bolts up.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You promised to let me kiss you.

                              CECILE
               But -

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pointing at her lips)
               I don't want to kiss you here. I want
               to kiss you there.

     Sebastian points to her crotch. She moves her hands to
     her sweats and looks up at him. Sebastian shrugs.

     Cecile pulls the string to her sweats. They fall to the
     floor.

47   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - DAY           47

     Mrs. Caldwell enters the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to
               be late for the -

     She notices the bed is empty.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

     She walks over the bathroom door and knocks.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               I'm in the bath, mom.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs.
               Rosemond's before lunch.

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               Okay.

48   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BATHROOM - DAY          48

     Cecile stands in front of her mirror, crying. She applies
     make-up to several hickeys on her neck. She XXX down
     her shirt and grimaces. She sticks her finger the make-
     up bottle, then puts her hand down her shirt.

49   EXT. ESTATE - TERRACE - DAY                                49

     Aunt Helen, Annette, Mrs. Caldwell and Cecile are having
     lunch. Cecile is wearing a turtle neck.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It was nice of you to invite us up
               for the weekend, Helen.

                              AUNT HELEN
               More the merrier.
                    (to Cecile)
               Is everything alright my dear?

                              CECILE
               I'm just not feeling well.

     Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Afternoon ladies.

     Cecile is stunned that he's there. Sebastian takes a
     seat at the table.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I didn't know you'd be here,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't planning on it, but being
               such a lovely day, why waste it in the
               city. Anyone for tennis?

     He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket.

     Cecile stands and rushes into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with her?

     No one knows.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Would you excuse me for a minute?

     Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (concerned)
               I hope she's alright.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I better go check on them.

     Aunt Helen stands and enters the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alone again.
                    (beat)
               What are you up to today?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm doing some volunteer work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need any company?

                              ANNETTE
               You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm
               trying to change here. You could be
               supportive.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Okay.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Babe, you're looking at the next Mother
               Teresa.

     Annette shakes her head and laughs.

50   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    50

     Cecile talks on the phone.

                              CECILE
               Please. I need you. I don't know what
               to do. You're the only one I can talk
               to.

51   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 51

     Kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll be there in a few hours.

     She hangs up the phone and smiles.

52   EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY                                 52

     Establishing shot.

53   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - DAY                       53

     A NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall.

                              NURSE
               It's really nice when the young people
               help out. Most of our patients don't
               have any family nearby.

     They stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his
     hospital bed.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for
               you.

     Sebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops
     him.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Actually Sebastian, you're going to be
               spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman.

     The Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the
     hall. Annette waves "bye bye" to him.

54   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MR. GOTTLIEB'S ROOM - DAY           54

     Annette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book
     of poetry.

55   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MRS. SUGARMAN'S ROOM - DAY          55

     A senile MRS. SUGARMAN sits in bed, while Sebastian does
     a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her. He smokes
     a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies
     next to her on the bed.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Did I ever tell you the time when my
               late husband sent me -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, you already did.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

     Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Right after we played backgammon.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               We played backgammon?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Uh huh. You beat me three times.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Excuse me?

     He turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said, do you want some water?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Oh... no thank you...

     There's a knock at the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come in.

     Annette and the nurse enter.

                              NURSE
               How we doing in here?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I won three games of backgammon.

     Sebastian smiles at Annette, who smiles back.

56   INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         56

     Sebastian and Annette drive towards the estate.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's weird. I actually feel good about
               myself. Can we do this again next week?

                              ANNETTE
               Oh please.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               "I actually feel good about myself?"

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              ANNETTE
               You must take me for a real idiot.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't.

                              ANNETTE
               You're going to tell me that you had a
               good time with the old lady.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I did. We played three games of backgammon
               and...

     She throws him a look.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking
               mind. I hate doing charity.

                              ANNETTE
               That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad
               person.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes it does.

                              ANNETTE
               No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being
               honest with me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sighs)
               I can't win with you.

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about winning. You know what
               your problem is? You take yourself way
               too seriously.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do not.

                              ANNETTE
               Lighten up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am lighten. Can we drop this?

                              ANNETTE
               Fine.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you doing? Stop it, it's
               distracting.

     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Cut it out.

     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.

                              ANNETTE
               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No.

                              ANNETTE
               No?

     She makes the face again. He laughs.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Stop that.

     She laughs with him.

                              ANNETTE
               There's hope for you, yet.

     She reaches out and holds his hand. He squeezes it.

57   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    57

     Cecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              CECILE
               Who is it?

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               It's Kathryn.

     Cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands
     there with a worried look on her face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Are you okay?

                              CECILE
               No.

     Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is
     crying.

                              KATHRYN
               Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.

                              CECILE
               Something awful happened last night.

                              KATHRYN
               What do you mean?!

                              CECILE
               I... I don't think you want to know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you have to tell me.

                              CECILE
               It involves your brother. He... took
               advantage of me.

                              KATHRYN
               Does your mother know?

                              CECILE
               If she knew, she'd kill me. It
               happened at your house last night.

                              KATHRYN
               Why didn't you do something?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               So, let me get this straight. You
               came over to our house late last night
               and he forced intercourse on you.

                              CECILE
               Well... not exactly.

                              KATHRYN
               He made you give him a blow job.

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well what then?

     Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               He ate you out?

                              CECILE
               If that's what you call it.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, I think you're going to have
               a hard time crying rape if that's all
               he did.

                              CECILE
               What do I do then?

                              KATHRYN
               Well did you like it?

                              CECILE
               Well... I don't know - it was weird.
               At first it felt icky, then it felt
               kind of okay. Then, I started getting
               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you had an orgasm.

                              CECILE
               I did?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.

                              CECILE
               I am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.

                              KATHRYN
               Now listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
               instruct you.

                              CECILE
               I don't love him. I love Ronald.

                              KATHRYN
               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
               Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
               many people as possible.

                              CECILE
               But that would make me a slut.
                    (beat)
               Wouldn't it?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
               that nobody talks about it.

     Cecile takes the information in.

                              CECILE
               It's like a secret society.

                              KATHRYN
               That's one way of looking at it.

                              CECILE
               Cool.

58   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 58

     Annette sits on the grass reading Gabriel Garcia
     Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. She puts the book
     down and wipes a tear from her eye.

59   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       59

     Sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars.
     Kathryn enters his room.

                              KATHRYN
               I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I
               don't think she'll be giving you
               anymore problems.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yippy.

                              KATHRYN
               Who are you spying on?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Take a look for yourself.

     He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the
     window.

                              KATHRYN
               That her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.
                    (sarcastic)
               Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset
               by the big bad book.

     Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up.

                              KATHRYN
               What's your problem?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's really getting to you, isn't
               she?

                              SEBASTIAN
               If you must know, yes. I don't know
               what to do. I can't stand that holier
               than thou bullshit and yet, I'm
               completely infatuated with her.
                    (beat)
               She made me laugh.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're losing your bet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not losing the bet. It's just
               taking longer than I expected.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you mind if I take my new Porsche
               for a ride?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, the only thing you're going to
               be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse
               me, I have some work to do.

     He storms out of the room.

60   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 60

     Sebastian walks over to Annette, who continues to read her
     book. She notices him and sets the book down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Am I bothering you?

                              ANNETTE
               Not at all. Have a seat.

     He sits down next to her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't tell me you finished The
               Fountainhead already?

     She nods. He points to her book.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Great book. What's the guy's name,
               Florentino...

                              ANNETTE
               Florentino Ariza.

     Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles
     around.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend
               of Florentino.

                              ANNETTE
               Who's Monsieur Philipe?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't know Monsieur Philipe?

     Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (low voice)
               Bonjour mademoiselle.

                              ANNETTE
                    (laughs)
               Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               You are very pretty. I would like to
               kiss you.

     The puppet kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               Oooo, that felt good.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

     He kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               That felt good too. I will kiss you
               all over.

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               I am too.

     He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know what? I don't take it back.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you doing this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Because I'm in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought you said we were going to be
               friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't handle it. I can't keep my
               feelings bottled up like you. Can you
               honestly tell me that you feel nothing
               for me? ... Tell me!

                              ANNETTE
               I have feelings for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
               It's not like you have a husband,
               unless your married to Jesus.

                              ANNETTE
               That's not fair.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why can't we be together?

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               You really want to know?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               It's because I don't trust myself with
               you.
                    (beat)
               I took a vow and because of you I'm
               tempted to break it. Don't destroy that
               for me. Please.

     She hurries off.

61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61

     Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (frustrated)
               Shit.

     He hears the shower running from the bathroom.

62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62

     Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out
     from the shower curtain.

                              CECILE
               Want to join me?

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (indifferent)
               Some other time, Cecile.

     He leaves the room. Cecile looks confused. A moment
     passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What am I, an idiot?

     Cecile smiles.

63   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63

     Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed. Sebastian smokes a
     cigarette and writes in his journal.

                              CECILE
               Am I suppose to be this sore?

                              SEBASTIAN
               For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

     A moment of silence.

                              CECILE
               I like it better when I'm on top.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. This is what I like to call
               quiet time. This is time when we
               reflect on what we've done.

                              CECILE
               I'm sorry.

     She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               Something's bothering you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You think?

                              CECILE
               Is it me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, you were fine.

     SEBASTIAN'S P.O.V. - He looks out on the balcony, where
     Kathryn is eavesdropping. They make eye contact and she
     waves.

                              CECILE
               It's that girl, Annette.

     He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes
     the blinds.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               You love her, don't you? It's okay.
               I don't love you either. I love Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm getting out of here.

     Sebastian heads to the bathroom.

                              CECILE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I'm taking a shower.

                              CECILE
               Need any company?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               No.

                              CECILE
               Want a blow job?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               Good night Cecile.

                              CECILE
                    (under her breath)
               Prude.

64   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 64

     Annette is reading in bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              ANNETTE
               Come in.

     Sebastian enters the room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I just came to say goodbye.

                              ANNETTE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Back to the city. I may take off to
               Europe for the rest of the summer. I
               just can't handle it around here.

                              ANNETTE
               I think that's for the best.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Good for you.

                              ANNETTE
               Sebastian, please. I don't want us to
               end on bad terms.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I'm afraid you don't have a
               choice in the matter. You make me
               sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't
               associate with hypocrites.

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               How am I a hypocrite?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh please Annette. You spend all your
               time preaching about waiting for love.
               Well here it is. Right in front of you,
               but you're going to turn your back on
               it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
               where we can get married. If we were,
               I'd propose, but that's not going to
               happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
               I'll move on, but you... you're going
               to have to live with yourself knowing
               you've turned your back on love. And
               that makes you a hypocrite.

     Sebastian heads to the door.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice life.

     Annette races toward him and throws her arms around him.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sobbing)
               Please don't go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get off me.

     She kisses him passionately.

                              ANNETTE
               I... I want you.

     Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed.

     She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian
     stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up
     as she continues to undress.

     Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry, I can't.

     A pained look crosses her face. Sebastian leaves the
     room and closes the door.

65   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     65

     Sebastian closes the door and leans against it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes
     over to a mirror at looks at himself.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Get it together you pussy.

     A stern look comes over his face. He smiles, then walks
     away.

66   EXT. ESTATE - FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY                         66

     A cab pulls up to the house. The front door opens and a
     crying Annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into
     the cab. She closes the door and the cab pulls away from
     the house. WE PAN up to a second story window where
     Kathryn is looking down and smiling.

67   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       67

     Sebastian lies sleeping in his bed. His journal lies
     beside him. A FEATHER tickles his nose. He stirs awake
     and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him.

                              KATHRYN
               Morning!

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sarcastic)
               Morning.

                              KATHRYN
               So? How'd it go last night?

                              SEBASTIAN
               With who?

                              KATHRYN
               Well I know how it went with Cecile.
               She won't shut up about it. How'd it
               go with Mrs. Jesus?

     Sebastian sits up in bed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               If your asking if I nailed her the
               answer is no.

                              KATHRYN
               She shot you down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Exactly the opposite.

                              KATHRYN
               So what went wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know. She was lying on the bed,
               ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I
               was... I just didn't feel right about
               it.

                              KATHRYN
               You're telling me you had the chance to
               fuck her and you didn't. God are you a
               chump.

                              SEBASTIAN
               A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to
               be rectified.

     He climbs out of bed and puts on his robe. He starts out
     the door, when -

                              KATHRYN
               If you're heading towards her room, you
               won't find her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?

                              KATHRYN
               You don't know?
                    (big smile)
               She left thirty minutes ago.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where'd she go?

                              KATHRYN
               She wouldn't say. She apologized to
               your aunt and told her she was going
               to stay with some friends.
                    (beat)
               You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has
               come to her senses and she will never
               go near you again.

     Sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               We'll see about that.

68   INT. GREG'S DORM ROOM - DAY                                68

     A shrine to hot babes, who's posters adorn the walls. Greg
     is busy dumping muscle magazines, several issues of Teen
     Beat and some Musical Theater CDs into a trash bag when the
     phone rings. He answers it.

                              GREG
               Hello.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

69   EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. PORSCHE - DAY                            69

     Sebastian is talking on his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Is she with you?

                              GREG
               Who is this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?

                              GREG
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?!

                              GREG
               I don't know. Why don't you leave her
               alone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in
               two seconds if you don't tell me where
               she is.

                              GREG
               I told you I don't know.

                              SEBASTIAN
               One.

                              GREG
               Alright. She's staying with some
               friends of her parents. The O'Sheas.
               She caught the train twenty minutes ago
               into Grand Central.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Grand Central. You better not be
               fucking with me cause it's your ass on
               the line.

     Sebastian clicks off his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Motherfucker.

     He bangs on his dashboard.

70   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                         70

     The Porsche weaves in and out of traffic on it's way to
     the city.

71   INT. TRAIN CONCOURSE - DAY                                 71

     A group of passengers exit the train. Annette is among
     them. She stops when she SEES -

     Sebastian, standing in the distance.

     Annette stops in her tracks. She drops her bag, rushes
     over to him and embraces him. Sebastian's cruel demeanor
     drops, when he realizes how happy she is to see him. He
     looks her in the eyes and smiles. They kiss.

72   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         72

     Sebastian carries a laughing Annette into the room. They
     continue to kiss and he carries her over to the table.

     He sets her down and accidentally knocks over a lamp.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooops.

     They both laugh. They kiss some more, then start to
     unbutton each other's clothes. Sebastian struggles with
     her pants' button.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Fuck this.

     He picks her up again and moves to the bed. They
     collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Suave.

     Annette cracks up. Sebastian reaches up and YANKS her
     down on top of him. They both laugh, then kiss.

     Establishing shot

74   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       74

     Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he
     sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

     She walks over to him and kisses him.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You alright?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm fine. I have to get going to my
               friends' house.
                    (beat)
               Was it --

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was perfect.

     She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in
     his.

75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75

     Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the
     hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's
     REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.

     Establishing shot.

77   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     77

     Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the
     hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He
     grabs her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You work way to hard. Here.
                    (hands her a wad of money)
               Take the day off. Merry Christmas.

     Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down
     the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Slower.

     Sebastian leans against the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               A little to the left. Look, pretend
               like you're writing the alphabet.
               A... B... mmm, stay on B.

     Sebastian knocks on the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               One second.

     Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from
     inside the bedroom.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Come in.

78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78

     Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed,
     wearing only her bathrobe.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Bad time?

                              KATHRYN
               Kind of.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you obviously wanted me to
               witness your little adventure or else
               you wouldn't have invited me in.

     Sebastian walks toward the closet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Who is our little friend so
               inexperienced that you have to resort
               to the alphabet game?

     He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there
     covering his genitals with his hands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Well, well, well.

                              RONALD
               It's not what it seems like.

     Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves:

                              SEBASTIAN
               Say hi to Cecile.

     Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him.

                              KATHRYN
                    (calling out)
               Call me.

     Sebastian throws Kathryn a look.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You can't have all the fun.

     Sebastian sits on the bed.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You seem to be in a good mood.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am.

     A big grin appears on Sebastian's face

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes.

                              KATHRYN
               Tell me all the details.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... Fantastic.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on. For her first time?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. That's the amazing part of
               it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du
               Soleil acrobatics, just standard
               missionary stuff, but it was... ah
               forget it. I'm going to sound like a
               Hallmark card.

                              KATHRYN
               No, tell me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... it was like the emotional
               part outweighed the physical part.

                              KATHRYN
               Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
               the birds chirping.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mock, mock, mock.

     She places her hand on his crotch.

                              KATHRYN
               So I assume you've come here to make
               some arrangements.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Some other time.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not in the mood.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're leaving?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It clearly is why.

                              KATHRYN
               I want to fuck.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And I don't.

     He leaves and slams the door behind him.

79   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         79

     Sebastian talks on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll pick you up in an hour. I love
               you too.

     He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, I'm not.

                              KATHRYN
               P-whipped, p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's wrong with you? Why are you
               acting this way?

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
               in love with her. You don't love me
               anymore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
               contest.

                              KATHRYN
               At first it was, but now it's become
               something bigger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
               always loved you.

                              KATHRYN
               Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't believe you're reacting this
               way. You're just saying this because
               you lost the bet.

                              KATHRYN
               Is that what you think?

     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
     aside, spreading her legs.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright, come on, let's get it over
               with. But mark my words, this is the
               only time it'll happen.

     She picks up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
               me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
               make some phone calls.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's not fair. You're taking all the
               fun out of it.

                              KATHRYN
               Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
               If not for me, then do it for you.
               Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
               turned you into jelly. What do you want
               to be, one of those losers who walk
               down the halls holding hands and
               smiling. People used to respect you.
               They feared you and now you're going to
               throw that all away.

     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but
               now he's just another love-struck
               faggot. One of the many.

80   EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY                                80

     A taxi drives down the street.

81   INT. TAXI - DAY                                            81

     Kathryn and Sebastian sit in the back seat. Her arm is
     around his. Sebastian looks nervous.

                              KATHRYN
               Why so nervous?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I've never done this before.

                              KATHRYN
               How have you dumped girls in the past?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Screening calls. Any suggestions?

                              KATHRYN
               I knew this guy last summer in the
               Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the
               time were madly in love with each
               other. But she had this huge weight
               problem. His friends taunted him
               mercilessly about it. You know, "How
               do you breathe when she sits on your
               face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
               be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
               "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm
               completely fucked up."
                    (beat)
               Poor fatty never had a chance.

82   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       82

     The cab pulls up to the curb. Sebastian gets out and
     heads into the building. Kathryn leans out the window.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't be weak.

     The cab drives off.

83   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY             83

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. A woman (MRS. O'SHEA)
     answers the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi. Is Annette at home?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               You must be Sebastian. I've heard such
               nice things about you.

     He smiles.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (cont'd)
                    (calling out)
               Annette.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Come on in.

84   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                        84

     Sebastian closes the door behind him. Annette enters the
     room.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Well, I'm going to head back to the
               kitchen. You two have fun.

     Mrs. O'Shea mouths "He's cute" to Annette. Annette
     smiles and nods. Mrs. O'Shea leaves the room.

                              ANNETTE
               Would you like a tour?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sure.

     She takes his hand and leads him down the hall.

85   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY         85

     They enter a guest room.

                              ANNETTE
               And this is my room.

     She closes the door behind them. She smiles and kisses
     him.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You think we can be quiet?

     She embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless.

                              SEBASTIAN
               This isn't working out for me anymore.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Yeah, me neither.

     She looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's not you, it's me. I'm completely
               fucked up.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you saying?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why aren't you understanding?

                              ANNETTE
               I love you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. I wish I felt the same.
               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
               completely fucked up.

     Annette bursts into tears.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you trying to hurt me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
               see what you were like in bed.

     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
     his hand.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
               would appreciate you acting like a
               total psychopath.

     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't know how to love.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't even know me. The fact of the
               matter is there is some one I love.
               She's smarter, prettier... you don't
               even compare to her. The only reason I
               am here is because she wants us to be
               exclusive.

                              ANNETTE
               But you knew this was important to me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, your virginity? Well that's over
               now.

     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
     towards her.

                              ANNETTE
               Please go.

     He opens the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.

     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette
     continues to sob.

86   EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               86

     A cab driver carries several shopping bags out of a cab.

87   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     87

     Kathryn walks down the hallway and enters her room.

88   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           88

     The room is dark. Kathryn flips on the light.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus.

     Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
     journal in hand.

                              KATHRYN
               A little melodramatic, don't you think.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I have a flair for drama.

                              KATHRYN
               Mind if I ask what you're doing in my
               room?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You wanted an answer to your question.

                              KATHRYN
               Annette?

     He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
     crying.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Devastated beyond repair. I doubt
               she'll ever trust a man again.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

     He holds up a bottle of champagne.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I thought we should celebrate.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm
               expecting some company.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald?

                              KATHRYN
               Not that it's any of your business but
               yes.

     Sebastian holds up a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               From Ronald.

     Kathryn takes the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I haven't had a chance to read it, but
               I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
               yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
               Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
               friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
               You see, I expected your sort of
               bullshit so I took the liberty of
               phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
               they're having a little get together
               in my love shack at the Grand Central
               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
               over you, but I promised him I would
               see you through your crisis.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you. Now, where were we?

     POP goes the champagne cork.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oh yeah, the celebration.

     He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
     and hands one to Kathryn.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What shall we toast to?

                              KATHRYN
               To my triumph, of course.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Not my choice of toast, but it's your
               call. To your triumph over Annette.

     Kathryn giggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's so funny?

                              KATHRYN
               Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her.
               It's over you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come again?

                              KATHRYN
               You were very much in love with her and
               you're still in love with her. But it
               amused me to make you ashamed of it.
               You gave up on the first person you
               ever loved because I called you names.
               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
               you chose me over her, but please
               understand, I never loved you,
               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
               toy I play with. And now you've
               completely blown it with her. I think
               that's the saddest thing I've ever
               heard.
                    (smiles)
               Cheers.

     She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
     drink. He looks ill.

                              SEBASTIAN
               In any event, you still owe me my
               reward.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't
               fuck losers.

     Sebastian slaps her across the face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You motherfucker!

     She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
     fall to the ground.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Nobody hits me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Calm down.

     He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.

                              KATHRYN
               Get off me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               Will you calm down?

                              KATHRYN
               Fine! Get off me!

     He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
     breaths.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.

                              KATHRYN
               I accept. Now get out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get out? We had an arrangement.

                              KATHRYN
               Didn't you hear what I said?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't care what you said, we had an
               agreement. You've slept with half of
               the borough so don't tell me you're
               being choosy.

                              KATHRYN
                    (screaming)
               Get out!

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm giving you to the count of three to
               plop your ass down on the bed.

                              KATHRYN
               And if I don't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then I will consider it a declaration
               of war. One. Two... three.

                              KATHRYN
               I think you have your answer.

                              SEBASTIAN
               War it is.

     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind
     him.

89   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         89

     Sebastian paces while talking on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's desperate that I talk to her.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I've already told you, she's not home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well please leave a message that I
               called.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I'll do that.

     He hangs up the phone and THROWS it into a mirror, which
     SMASHES.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He collapses on his bed and buries his face in his hands.
     Exhausted he looks up and sees his journal lying on the
     floor. He picks it up and flips through it.

90   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     90

     Sebastian walks down the street carrying a small package.
     He enters an apartment building.

91   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT           91

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. Mrs. O'Shea answers the
     door.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               What do you want?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I need to talk to Annette.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know where she is?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know when she'll be back?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Later. Listen, we're entertaining
               some guests so -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Annette! Annette!

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Young man, I already told you she's
               not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Could you please see that she
               gets this.

     He hands her the package.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I'll do that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's really important.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I understand. Good night.

     She closes the door.

92   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - NIGHT                      92

     Mrs O'Shea turns away from the door towards Annette,
     who stands in the hallway.

93   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         93

     Kathryn sits in a chair doing her nails. She checks her
     watch, takes a moment and makes herself upset. She picks
     up the phone and dials.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

94   INT. RONALD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              94

     Ronald is sleeping. The phone rings. He awakens and
     answers it.

                              RONALD
               Hello.

                              KATHRYN
                    (voice cracking)
               Ronald?

                              RONALD
               Yeah?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Kathryn.

     Ronald sits up, nervous.

                              RONALD
               Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

     She cries.

                              RONALD
               What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

                              RONALD
               What do you mean?

                              KATHRYN
               I think he's high on drugs. He hit me,
               then took off. I'm afraid to be alone.
               Please come over.

                              RONALD
               I'll be right there.

     He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants

                                                       BACK TO:

95   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           95

     Kathryn hangs up the phone. She instantly becomes calm and
     returns to doing her nails.

96   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       96

     Annette sits and stares at Sebastian's package.

     She picks it up and opens it. She takes out a journal
     and a letter. She opens the letter and reads it.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Dear Annette. Thank you for reading
               this letter. I don't know what I can
               possibly say to rectify the harm I have
               caused you. For once in my life I'm at
               a loss for words.

97   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       97

     Sebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               The truth of the matter is that being
               with you was the only time I have ever
               been happy. My whole life has been a
               joke. I prided myself on taking joy in
               others' misery.

98   INT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT (MONTAGE)                    98

     Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad
     and lonely.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
               in hurting the first person I loved. I
               wish more than anything I could take it
               back, but I guess that's not possible.

99   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       99

     Annette continues to read the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Enclosed is my most prized possession...
               my journal. For a long time I
               considered it my trophy. A sordid
               collection of my conquests. If you
               really want to know the truth, then
               please read it. No more lies.

100  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     100

     We PAN down the side of the building to the ground.
     Sebastian lies against the building waiting for Annette
     to return.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               A car is picking me up tomorrow and
               taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where
               we have a summer home. Nothing would
               make me happier than if you joined me.
               I'm a fucking wreck without you. If
               you're interested please meet me
               outside my building at nine. If not, I
               understand. Love, Sebastian.

101  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               101

     Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her
     story.

                              KATHRYN
               And when I confronted him about his
               affair with Cecile he told me it was
               none of my business. Then when I said
               "Well what about Ronald," he said you
               were nothing more than a stupid... the
               n word and that you deserved what you
               got...

                              RONALD
               And this happened before you and I
               hooked up?

                              KATHRYN
               It's been going on for a while.
                    (beat)
               Then he called me a disgrace to our
               family and that's when he hit me.

                              RONALD
               Racist piece of shit.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd be careful if I were you. God knows
               what he's up to.

                              RONALD
               He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass
               in.

                              KATHRYN
               Will you stay here for the night? You
               can leave in the morning. That's when
               my parents get back and --

                              RONALD
               Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

     Kathryn hugs him.

                              KATHRYN
               Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.

102  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       102

     A STREET CLEANING MACHINE drives past the apartment

103  INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY               103

     Sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby. The
     NIGHT DOORMAN taps him awake.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What time is it?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Eight o'clock. You got to go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did she show up?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Nope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you mind if I check upstairs?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               I can't have you do that, nor can I
               have you hanging around the lobby all
               day.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I understand. Thanks for letting me
               crash here.

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Don't worry about it.

     Sebastian stands and staggers out of the building.

104  EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               104

     Ronald walks out of the building and heads toward the
     corner.

     He stops when he SEES - Sebastian crossing the street.

                              RONALD
                    (under his breath)
               Son of a bitch.

     Sebastian walks toward Ronald, who blocks his path.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up at Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (tired)
               Hey Ronald.

                              RONALD
               It seems that you and I have some
               talking to do.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Can we do it later. I've had a really
               bad night and -

     Ronald SHOVES Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's your problem?

                              RONALD
               Where the hell do you come off hitting
               women?

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you talking about?

                              RONALD
               Kathryn. Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

                              RONALD
               Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, you don't know what you're
               talking about.

                              RONALD
               Don't know what I'm talking about? I
               know that you fucked Cecile.

     Sebastian says nothing.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               It's true, isn't it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, I'm sorry.

                              RONALD
               You bastard!

     Ronald TACKLES Sebastian to the ground. Ronald lands on
     top of him and hits in the mouth.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Ronald hits him again. Blood pours out of Sebastian's
     mouth. Sebastian is dazed. Ronald grabs him by the
     collar.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Sebastian takes a moment to catch his breath.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fuck you.

     He knees Ronald in the groin. Ronald screams in pain and
     falls over. Sebastian climbs to his feet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why don't you give me a chance to
               explain.

     Sebastian kicks him in the ass. Ronald falls over.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Don't you get it? We were all part of
               her game.

     Sebastian pins him to the ground. Ronald struggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm gonna let you up, but you have to
               give me a chance to explain. Understood?

     Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches
     his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES -

     Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the
     event.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette!

     Sebastian stands and races over to her, blindly crossing
     the street.

     Annette notices a speeding cab and -

                              ANNETTE
                    (pointing)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him
     dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the
     street.

     Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs
     into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock,
     He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. I'm okay.

     Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them.

                              ANNETTE
               Get an ambulance!

     The cab driver races back to his car. Sebastian looks up
     at Annette.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We're getting you to a hospital.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Holy shit.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're gonna be fine.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               It's alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. Everything's good.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

105  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 105

     Blaine, twenty high-school girls and several friends of
     the family are dressed in black, making polite conversation
     and consoling Sebastian's parents and his Aunt Helen.

     Mrs. Caldwell stands in the corner with Cecile and her
     husband, MR. CALDWELL.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Sad, sad, sad. To think of the
               opportunities that boy had. This should
               be a lesson to us all that our children
               need constant supervision.

     She puts her arm around Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (CONT'D)
               It's all about quality time.

106  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         106

     Annette enters Sebastian's room, now cleaned up. She
     walks around the room, taking it in, then approaches the
     window. She stares out of it for a moment.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               He loved that view.

     Annette turns and sees Kathryn at the door. She enters
     the room.

                              ANNETTE
               I can see why.

     Kathryn extends her hand.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm Kathryn.

                              ANNETTE
               Annette Harrison.

     They shake.

                              KATHRYN
               Have we met?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't think so.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you know Sebastian well?

                              ANNETTE
               You might say that.

                              KATHRYN
               Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your
               father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.

                              ANNETTE
               That's right.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sure you're going to love it there.

     Annette nods.

                              KATHRYN
               Are you okay?

                              ANNETTE
               I'll be fine.

                              KATHRYN
                    (beat)
               Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just
               came in here to get something of mine.

     Kathryn walks over to Sebastian's desk and takes the keys
     to his Porsche. She goes to leave, when she turns back to
     Annette.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You sure you're going to be alright?
               I'm here if you need a friend.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

                              KATHRYN
               Look, I know this sounds corny, but
               whenever I feel like I can't go on I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to Jesus and he helps me through
               the problem. Call me an anachronism,
               but -

                              ANNETTE
               Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              ANNETTE
               You heard me.

                              KATHRYN
               Who the hell do you think you are
               coming into my house and saying those
               things to me. My brother is dead, have
               some respect.

                              ANNETTE
               Kathryn, I know all about you and
               Sebastian.

                              KATHRYN
               Sebastian was a pathological liar. I
               wouldn't believe a word he -

                              ANNETTE
               I have his journal.

                              KATHRYN
               You what?

                              ANNETTE
               His journal. He sent it to me the day
               before he died. Everything about you is
               in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs,
               the menages, your bout with bulimia,
               the affair you had with your guidance
               counselor and how he gave you... eww.
               Let's see, then there's your coke
               problem... You still keep it in your
               crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't show it to anybody?

                              ANNETTE
               Actually, I was planning on running
               down to Kinkos. Do you think you could
               give me ride?

                              KATHRYN
               You can't do this to me. It could ruin
               me.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               I know.

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you
               once say that crying is a sign of
               weakness? I'm very disappointed in you.

     Kathryn continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Alright, stop crying. There's a bright
               side to this you know.

     Annette puts a comforting arm around her.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're going to be my pet project next
               year. You're going to do what I tell
               you to do, wear what I tell you to
               wear. You're going to befriend the
               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.
               Think of the social ramifications it
               will cause. You and I are going to turn
               this school around. And do you know why
               you're going to do it?
                    (beat)
               Cause your ass is mine.

     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully
     on the mouth, then shoves her back. Kathryn looks at her
     in horror.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We'll be in touch.

     She winks at Kathryn then leaves.

     CLOSE ON: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian's bed,
     utterly defeated.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Forgot something.

     Annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out
     of Kathryn's hands.

107  INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         107

     Annette races down the highway. She opens up the glove
     compartment and rifles through some cassettes. She takes
     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.

     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing "Goodbye To Love."

     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's
     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in
     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.

108  EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - AERIAL POV. - DAY                  108

     We MOVE off the Porsche and ascend into the air. The
     Porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a
     sea of cars. WE SEE the Manhattan skyline in the background
     as WE -

                                                       FADE OUT.

                              THE END
CRUEL INVENTIONS

1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1

     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.

2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2

     A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus. We've been at this for six
               months.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               And you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
                    (not looking up)
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               But you said you have the worst
               reputation.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't you want to change that?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Let me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I think that's all the time we have
               for today.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Same time next week?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No. This is going to be our last
               session.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               He was a coke addict, you know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It works a little.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No it doesn't. I see right through you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You do?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               My daughter, Rachel.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yummy.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really? Care to make a wager on that?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Good luck, Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, nervous I'm going to win?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Would you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Rachel, it's mom.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

3    INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                3

     RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk,
     crying while holding the phone.

                              RACHEL
               Hi, mom.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Honey, is something wrong?

     Rachel cries for a moment.

                              RACHEL
               He told me he loved me and I believed
               him.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Who told you?

                              RACHEL
               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

     She continues to cry.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep
               breath, and step out of the circle.

                              RACHEL
               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
               mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

     WE PAN OVER TO HER COMPUTER CONSOLE. CLOSE ON: COMPUTER
     MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League
     Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to
     a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her
     privates.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               What kind of pictures?

                              RACHEL
               Nudie pictures, what do you think?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus Christ, how can you be so
               stupid?

                              RACHEL
               I don't know. He was just so charming.
               All he did was talk about how I had
               killer legs and how we wanted to
               photograph them. Things just got out
               of hand from there.
                    (she hears the phone drop)
               Mom? Are you there? Mom?
                    (screaming)
               Mother!!!!

4    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY           4

     Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots
     Sebastian standing in the elevator.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You son of a bitch.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Fuck off, Harold.

     He gasps.

5    EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               5

     A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
     pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red
     zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the
     steps to the townhouse.

                              METER MAID
               You can't park there.

     Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.

6    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                     6

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     CLOSE ON:  A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher
     knife comes down on the tuna cutting it's head off.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice
     roll.

7    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     7

     CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi
     through several doors until we enter the final door
     leading into -

8    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 8

     A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a
     view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around
     the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel.

     SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi
     in front of -

     KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain
     skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an
     East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her
     face and listens attentively as -

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful
     teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt
     with a Koala Bear on it.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't tell you how happy we are that
               Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
               this fall. You've always been an
               inspiration to Beau and I on raising
               her. We just hope she can rise to the
               high standards which you've set for
               her.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll do my best.

     Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese)
               Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be
               all.

     Sook-Hee leaves.

                              CECILE
               What was that?

                              KATHRYN
               I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a
               beautiful language.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Kathryn is a straight A student at
               Oakwood as well as being President of
               the French Club. Listen to whatever
               she has to say and you'll go far.

                              KATHRYN
                    (in French)
               You're too kind.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring
               that goes on in high school. Where
               do you get your strength?

                              KATHRYN
               I know this sounds corny, but whenever
               I feel temptations of peer pressure,
               I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to God and he helps me through the
               problem. Call me an anachronism, but
               it works.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               That's beautiful.

                              CECILE
               What are the boys like?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile, is that the best you can do?
                    (to Kathryn)
               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I hear she's recovering quite well.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               You remember my daughter, Cecile.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My, what an adorable shirt you're
               wearing.

                              CECILE
               My father just took me on a trip to Australia.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              CECILE
               What year are you in?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

                              CECILE
               But I thought high school is only four years.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.

     He winks at Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I think we'll be going now.
                    (to Kathryn)
               Thanks for all your help.

     Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll call you later and we'll get together
               and plan your curriculum.

                              CECILE
               Thanks.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Nice meeting you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ciao.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash
               and her stupid daughter are doing in my
               house?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               The parental units called while you were out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?

                              KATHRYN
               Hopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
               going well?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was fine.

     He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
               Manhattan Debutantes.

     He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nothing shocks them anymore.

     He scratches the nude's pubic area.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
               touch.

     He kisses it.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have
               a mission for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

9    EXT. PARK - DAY                                            9

     COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears
     a Polo sweater with an American Flag.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
               Reynolds?

     Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing
     the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes
     up her hair.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth
               Of July Weekend?

10   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 10

     Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.

                              KATHRYN
               He didn't dump me. We had a parting of
               the ways.

     Sebastian stares her down.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright he dumped me.

     He smiles, then swallows the sushi.

11   EXT. PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE/INT. COURT' S CAR - NIGHT       11

     A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final
     swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.

                              KATMRYN (V.O.)
               I went to great lengths to please Court.
               Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
               keep him happy.

     Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.

                              SEBASTIAN(V.O.)
               Swallow?

     She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               What do you think?

     Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Sorry.

12   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 12

                              KATHRYN
               In any event, my feelings were hurt when I
               learned that he had fallen for someone else.
               Someone chaste... pure... innocent.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't mean?

13   EXT. PARK - DAY                                            13

     Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop
     ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               None other than Cecile Caldwell.

     She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone.
     She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet

14   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 14

     Sebastian snickers.

                              KATHRYN
               I don't find this very funny,

                              SEBASTIAN
               So that's what this is all about.
                    (imitating Kathryn)
               We'll get together and plan your
               curriculum.

                              KATHRYN
               Keep your friends close and your
               enemies closer. When I get through
               with her, she'll be the premier Blow
               Job Queen of the Tri-State area and
               poor little Court's heart will be
               shattered.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why go through Cecile? Why not just
               attack Court?

                              KATHRYN
               Because if there's an attack made on
               Court it could be traced back to me.
               I can't allow that to happen.
               Everybody loves me and I intend to
               keep it that way.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I see your point... though why should
               I care?

                              KATHRYN
               I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
               Introduce her to your world of
               decadence and debauchery.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sounds intriguing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's quite cute you know. Young
               supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
               an uncharted pootie.

     Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his
     lips.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
               Boldly go where no man has gone
               before.

     Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues
     to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't.

     Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.

                              KATHRYN
               Why not?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
               "But I thought high school was only
               four years." I mean, please. She knows
               nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
               have her under the table at Au Bar
               sucking me off before the appetizer
               arrived. Go get one of those moron
               friends of yours to do it. I have a
               reputation to uphold.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh but diddling the therapist's
               daughter is a challenge?

                              SEBASTIAN
               That was just simple revenge. What I
               have planned requires sheer genius.

     He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."

                              KATHRYN
               I'm not interested in the latest dating
               tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up and turn to page 64.

     She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title
     reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait
     Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas
     City, Missouri.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus Christ, is she for real?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes. I've read it over and over again.
               This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little
               angel. A paradigm of chastity and
               virtue.

                              KATHRYN
               B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
               Kansas and woo little Dorothy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It just so happens we're not in Kansas
               anymore. Our little angel's father has
               accepted the new headmaster position at
               Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
               in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
               house. Can you imagine what this would
               do for my reputation? Screwing the new
               headmaster's virginal daughter before
               school starts? It will be my greatest
               victory.

                              KATHRYN
               You don't stand a chance. Even this is
               out of your league.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Care to make a wager on that?

                              KATHRYN
               I'll think about it...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
               chapter to my work of art.

     He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more
               queer?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Could you be more desperate to read it?

     Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh Sebastian. About that little wager
               of yours.

     He stops.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Count me in.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are the terms?

                              KATHRYN
               If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
               of yours is mine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And if I win?

     She approaches him.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll give you something you've been
               jerking off about ever since our parents
               got married.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Be more specific.

                              KATHRYN
               In English.
                    (whispers in his ear)
               I'll fuck your brains out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What makes you think I'd go for that
               bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
               car.

                              KATHRYN
               Because I'm the only person you can't
               control and it kills you.

     Sebastian sneers at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Do we have a deal?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No way, that car means everything to
               me.

     She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.

                              KATHRYN
                    (whispering)
               You can put it anywhere.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Even there?

                              KATHRYN
                    (baby talk)
               It would feel so yummy.

     Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Happy hunting.

15   EXT. ROSEMOND ESTATE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   15

     WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and
     stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE.
     Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.

16   EXT. ESTATE - MEADOW - DAY                                 16

     ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
     seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt.
     The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl.
     The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.

                              ANNETTE
               It's a beautiful home you have here
               Mrs. Rosemond.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
               with my family for over sixty years.
               Does your family do much riding?

                              ANNETTE
               My mother and I used to ride a lot,
               before she got sick.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
               farm so I would come over and ride all
               the time.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in
               the mid-west. What's his name?

                              ANNETTE
               Ben Schwarz.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Schwarz. Jewish?

                              ANNETTE
               German.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Doesn't ring a bell.

     Annette throws her a concerned look.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               In any event, I want you to consider
               this your home for the time being.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet
               around here.

     BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What was that?

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian must be here.

     Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.

17   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 17

     Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper,
     FRANKLIN stands by the trap.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pull!

     The TARGET soars into the air,

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Die motherfucker!

     He fires the gun, missing the target.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shit, shit, shit.

     Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian
     perks up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Kitty. Kitty.

     He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
     again. Sebastian searches for the cat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.

     He raises his rifle and takes aim.

                              AUNT HELEN (O.S.)
               Sebastian!

     He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and
     Annette riding over to him. He waves.

     Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I've been looking all over for you.
               God, I've missed you.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I've missed you too. How are your
               parents?

                              SEBASTIAN
               They're coming back next week. I write
               them everyday.

     She strokes his cheek, lovingly.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
               She's going to be staying with me for
               a few weeks.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.

     He extends his hand and they shake.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (to Aunt Helen)
               Why don't you head in and whip us up
               some of that ice tea of yours? We'll
               take care of the horses.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Anything for you, my dear.

     Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               Stay out of trouble you two.

                              SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE
               We will.

     He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.

18   INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18

     Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.

                              SEBASTIAN
               So what year are you going into?

                              ANNETTE
               Junior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Got a boyfriend back home?

                              ANNETTE
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't know. Relationships seem too
               distracting. I'd rather concentrate on
               my studies.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You a lesbo?

                              ANNETTE
                    (annoyed)
               No.

     She bends over to pick up the saddle.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nice.

     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.

                              ANNETTE
               Are you often this offensive on a first
               encounter?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just being honest. You happen to
               have a nice ass. Sorry.

     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I read your teen beat manifesto.

                              ANNETTE
               You did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I must say I found it rather appalling.

                              ANNETTE
               That's a first. Most people praised me
               for it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Most people are morons. I mean who are
               you to knock what you've never experienced?

                              ANNETTE
               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
               belief that people shouldn't actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh really?

                              ANNETTE
               Take yourself. You've slept with several
               women. Are you happier because of it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               How do you know I've been with several
               women?

                              ANNETTE
               A friend wrote me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pissed)
               Well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
               but you still didn't answer the question.

     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who the hell is taking the time to write
               letters, spreading this shit about me?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not really important.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
               not going to be friends.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you being so dramatic?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
               trying to deal with them and the last
               thing I need is people spreading shit
               about me.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright, I said I was sorry.
                    (beat)
               Can we start over again? I think we've
               gotten off on the wrong foot.

     She approaches him and they shake.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Annette Harrison.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian Valmont.

     She smiles, but before he releases her hand:

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since
               you've never had sex do you touch
               yourself?

     She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What did I say?

19   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      19

     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.

                              RONALD (O.S.)
               That's good, that's good.

     WE PULL BACK

     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
     music lesson.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now let's try the A minor scale.

     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.

     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Once more, and remember the third note
               is flat.

     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.

                              CECILE
               Oh, I suck. I suck.

                              RONALD
               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

     Cecile takes a deep breath

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               You're concentrating too much on your
               bowing. Let it flow.

     He stands and sits behind her.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Here, let me help you.

     He places his hand over hers.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and let's try again.

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
               Your playing was beautiful.

     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile

                              CECILE
               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
               giving me music lessons over the
               summer.

     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.

                              RONALD
               Pleased to meet you.

                              KATHRYN
               Likewise I'm sure.

                              CECILE
               Ronald is one of the few high school
               students attending Juliard. He's
               composing his first opera.

                              RONALD
               It's based on the life of Doctor
               Martin Luther King.

                              CECILE
               Doctor King is my favorite.

     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.

                              RONALD
               I guess our hour's up. Same time
               tomorrow?

     Cecile nods.

20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20

     Another nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is
     parked outside.

21   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                        21

     A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine
     to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art.

     BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and
     open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds
     from his stash.

     Sebastian paces behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -

                              BLAINE
               - none taken -

                              SEBASTIAN
               - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
               shit about me.

                              BLAINE
               Any ideas who it could be?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
               wouldn't be alive right now.

                              BLAINE
               Where did you say she's from?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

                              BLAINE
               Greg McConnell.

                              SEBASTIAN
               The football stud?

                              BLAINE
               He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
               surprised if he was your rat.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
               I fingered his girlfriend at the game
               last year.

                              BLAINE
               I don't think that bothered him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you mean?

                              BLAINE
               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
               ends on and off the field.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you shitting me?

                              BLAINE
               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
               go at it for a while, then as soon as
               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
               know -
                    (imitating Greg)
               "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
               I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
                    (beat)
               It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
               gay, deal with it. The only reason why
               I let him continue with his charade is
               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

                              BLAINE
               Not anymore. Football team started
               practice last week. He's already called
               me to hook up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really. You think you could arrange a
               little get together with him tonight on
               my behalf?

                              BLAINE
               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
               Spartacus on television tonight.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              BLAINE
               Don't think it's not going to cost you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No problem. Just make sure your front
               door is unlocked. Shall we say the
               "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?

     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.

22   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                    22

     Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
     around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
     a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
     Cecile and braids her hair.

                              KATHRYN
               So, rumor has it that you went on a date
               with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
               nice.

                              CECILE
               He's alright.
                    (giggles)
               He kept talking about this bulimic
               headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.

                              KATHRYN
               Really? Bulimic headcase.

                              CECILE
               What a loser she must be.
                    (beat)
               Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
               for Labor Day Weekend.

                              KATHRYN
               That's great.

                              CECILE
               You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
               just scared.

                              KATHRYN
               What are you scared of?

                              CECILE
               Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
               first base with a guy. What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               Haven't you ever practiced with one of
               your girlfriends?

                              CECILE
               Eww. No. That's gross.

                              KATHRYN
               It's not gross. How else do you think
               girls learn? Here turn around and
               face me.

     Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and wet your lips.

                              CECILE
               Are you for real?

                              KATHRYN
               Do you want to learn or not?

                              CECILE
               I guess. It still sounds gross.

     Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
     her on the mouth.

                              KATHRYN
               See that wasn't so bad.

                              CECILE
               It was nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               Let's try it again, only this time I'm
               going to stick my tongue in your
               mouth. When I do that I want you to
               massage my tongue with yours. That's
               what first base is.

                              CECILE
                    (reluctant)
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Eyes closed.

     Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
     again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
     then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
     as instructed and they start to make out.

     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
     continues her seduction.

     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.

     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
     and smile.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Not bad.

                              CECILE
               That was cool.

                              KATHRYN
               Maybe you should try it on your friend
               Ronald sometime.

                              CECILE
               What are you saying?

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
               you.

                              CECILE
               Is it that obvious?

     Kathryn nods.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               He sends me letters you know. Love
               letters.

                              KATHRYN
               That's so romantic. Have you
               responded?

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well do you like him?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, we just made out in the middle
               of Central Park. You can trust me.

                              CECILE
                    (beat)
               I do like him. I can't stop thinking
               about him.

     Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               What am I going to do? If my mother
               found out about Ronald she would kill
               me.

     Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.

                              KATHRYN
               Listen to me. Your mother must never
               know. Never.

                              CECILE
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you hide the letters?

                              CECILE
               Yes. They're in this antique doll house
               in my room.

                              KATHRYN
               I want you to make me copies of his
               letters and bring them to me.

                              CECILE
               Why?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
               at it's love letters. With my help,
               he'll be eating out of the palm of
               your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
               little get together for the two of you
               at my house.

                              CECILE
               You'd do that for me?

                              KATHRYN
               Of course I would. We're friends,
               right?

                              CECILE
               Best friends.

     Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

23   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 23

     Little touches of Annette's life (photo of dead mother)
     adorn the room. Annette is reading The Fountainhead when
     she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to
     concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony.

24   EXT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT                    24

     Annette steps onto the balcony.

     HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair
     sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and
     singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German.

                              ANNETTE
                    (calling out)
               Excuse me. Excuse me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You talking to me?

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I know this is your house and all,
               but do you think you couid keep it down?
               I'm trying to read.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What'cha reading?

                              ANNETTE
               The Fountainhead.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Great book.

                              ANNETTE
                    (skeptical)
               You've read The Fountainhead?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
               you know. When Howard Roark makes love
               to Dominique Francon... most romantic
               scene in all of literature.

                              ANNETTE
               Romantic? He rapes her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's a matter of opinion.

                              ANNETTE
               You need help.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why don't you come join me for a swim
               and we'll discuss it.

                              ANNETTE
               At this hour? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on. Quit acting like a
               geriatric and get in the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Gee, with an invitation like that how
               could a girl refuse.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Please.

                              ANNETTE
               Give me a minute. I'll be right down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you.

     She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone
     RINGS. He answers it.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

25   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         25

     Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small
     tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot.

                              KATHRYN
               Fuck her yet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm working on it.

                              KATHRYN
               Loser.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blow me.

                              KATHRYN
               Call me later.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay.

     She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently
     jabs her toe.

                              KATHRYN
               Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.

                              SOOK-HEE
               Sorry.

     Kathryn kicks some water in her face.

                              KATHRYN
               Oops.

26   EXT. ESTATE - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT                        26

     Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
     pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.

                              ANNETTE
                    (holding out the letter)
               You know it amazes me that someone as
               bright as you can be so horrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What? Another letter from your friend?

                              ANNETTE
               This is my favorite part.
                    (reading the letter)
               Even more treacherous and dangerous than
               he is charming and fascinating. He has
               never taken a single step or spoken a
               single word without some dishonorable
               or criminal intention. Every young girl
               he has successfully pursued has
               regretted it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know you could at least have the
               decency of telling me who's badmouthing
               me so I might have the opportunity to
               confront them face to face. How do you
               know it's not some girl who's pissed
               off at me for breaking up with her?

                              ANNETTE
               I sincerely doubt it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Give me the fucking letter.

     Annette smiles and tears the letter up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why did you do that?

                              ANNETTE
               The last thing I need is you going into
               my room searching for this while I'm
               away.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (mocking)
               Is that the last thing you need? My
               your clever.

     She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
     then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
     bathing suit underneath.

                              ANNETTE
               How's the water?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Refreshing.

     She dives in the pool and surfaces.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You're right you know.

                              ANNETTE
               About what?

                              SEBASTIAN
               About what you said today in the stable.
               I'm not a happy person.

                              ANNETTE
               I never said that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You implied it.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
               time.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
               with all your morals and values and
               well, YOU seem to be happy in your
               choices. I envy you. No bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
                    (caught off guard)
               Thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Seriously, you're amazing. You have
               everything going for you.
                    (counts with his fingers)
               You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
               determined. You're everything I want
               in a girlfriend.

                              ANNETTE
                    (jokingly)
               Shut up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
               out.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
               could never work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               Because you act like a pig.

     He swims towards her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you deny that there's an attraction
               between us?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't... I don't want to answer that...
               look we're friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't find me cute? Come on, look
               at these muscles.

     He flexes for her. She laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
               that.

     He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
     him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.

                              ANNETTE
               You're naked.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's my house.

     She pushes him off her.

                              ANNETTE
               That's repulsive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's the big deal? We're friends.
               Haven't you ever seen your friends
               naked before?

     Annette climbs out of the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Get some manners.

     She walks into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.

     She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail
               Mary's for you.
                    (beat)
               Good night.

27   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                27

     Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside.

28   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28

     Sebastian presses his ear to the door.

                              GREG (O.S.)
                    (moaning)
               Oh baby... oh baby...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Baby?
                    (checks his watch)
               Right on time.

29   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      29

     GREG McCONNELL, All-American star football player for
     Oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by Blaine,
     who lies under the covers.

                              GREG
                    (near orgasm)
               Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm
               gonna cum... I'm gonna...

     The door swings open and Sebastian enters.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy
               shit.

                              GREG
               Jesus!

     Greg throws the covers over his face. Sebastian smiles
     and sits. He lights a cigarette. No movement from under
     the covers.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Greg, is that you under the covers?

                              GREG
                    (from under the covers)
               Get out of here.

     Sebastian stands YANKS the covers off the bed, revealing
     Greg and Blaine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Whoa!

                              GREG
               I told you to lock the door.

                              BLAINE
               I thought I did.

                              GREG
               Look Valmont. This was the first time
               I've ever done something like this. I
               was --

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (apathetic)
               -- really drunk and blah blah blah
               blah blah.

                              GREG
               Please don't tell anyone. This could
               ruin my career.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Your career? What about your family?
               Can you imagine the humiliation your
               father's going to feel when he finds
               out his pride and joy is a fudge-
               packer.

                              BLAINE
               Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's
               not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes
               but not a fudge packer.

                              GREG
                    (to Sebastian)
               Please. I'm begging you. I'll do
               anything. Let's just forget the whole
               thing.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you
               there. It's too good to pass up.

     Greg starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               After all, it is you who's bad-
               mouthing me to Annette Harrison.

                              GREG
               Annette Harrison? I don't know what
               you're talking about.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come on Greg. You're the only one who
               knows her. The truth will save you.

                              GREG
                    (sobbing)
               I swear on my life, I never said a
               word to her about you.

                              BLAINE
               I think he's telling the truth
               Valmont. Greg couldn't write a
               grocery list let alone a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alright, I believe you. Stop crying.
               Your secret's safe with me.

     Greg wipes his eyes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               However, this whole incident's kind of
               turned me on.

     Sebastian unzips his fly.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You get my point.

     Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to
     Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles.

     Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when -

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Jesus Christ, I was only kidding.
               What do you think, I'm gay? My God,
               haven't you had enough for tonight.

                              BLAINE
               Our boy just can't get enough dick.

                              GREG
               You sick son of a bitch.

     Blaine and Sebastian laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave you guys alone.
                    (macho voice)
               Score one for the team, Greg.

     Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Come to think of it, there is
               something you can do for me.

30   EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY                                   30

     Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
     YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
     lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.

     Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
     her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need a lift?

                              ANNETTE
               No thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are you today?

                              ANNETTE
               Give it up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
               you an apology.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm not going to speak to you till you
               realize that you can't intimidate me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said I was sorry.

     She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice sleep last night?

                              ANNETTE
               It was fine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wish I could say the same for
               myself. I was up thinking about you
               all night.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought we agreed that we were going
               to be friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
               switch the "on" button to "off." The
               sad fact of the matter is that you've
               unintentionally rubbed off on me.

     Annette stops running and turns to him.

                              ANNETTE
               And that's a bad thing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm trying to better myself, but the
               one person who can help me is the same
               one pushing me away.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
               savior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well try this one on for size. I think
               I'm falling in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't even know me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't you believe in love at first sight?

                              ANNETTE
               Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
               is far from mutual.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
               time together this morning?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who?

                              ANNETTE
               That's none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How about tonight?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm busy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Doing what?

                              ANNETTE
               That's also none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
               win your heart. I'll do anything. I
               can't get you out of my mind.

                              ANNETTE
               You truly want to do something to make
               me happy?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               And you promise to abide by it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Without question.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright.
                    (beat)
               I want you to leave and go back to
               New York.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               If that's a problem, then I'll make
               arrangements to stay with some friends.

     Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about being happy. You and I
               can't -

     He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.

31   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           31

     Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the
     ocean.

                              GREG
               He told you he's failing in love
               with you? I've never known him to
               say those words before.

                              ANNETTE
               Really? I thought he said it all
               the time.

                              GREG
               That's not his style. one thing I can
               say about Valmont. He always speaks
               the truth.

     Annette looks lost.

                              GREG (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              ANNETTE
               Nothing.

                              GREG
               Is there a mutual feeling between you
               two?

                              ANNETTE
               No. I mean. I don't know.
                    (beat)
               What else do you know about him?

                              GREG
               Not a whole lot. We take some classes
               together. He's got a bad rep, but it's
               mostly bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
               What do you mean?

                              GREG
               Well, a lot of people are jealous cause
               he's loaded.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sighs)
               I don't know. I've been hearing some
               awful things about him.

                              GREG
               From who?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

     Greg takes her hand.

                              GREG
               Annette, how long have we known each
               other?

                              ANNETTE
               Forever.

                              GREG
               Now it's my job to look out for you.
               You're like a kid sister to me. Do I
               look like some kind of gossip queen?

     Annette laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               You promise not to say anything?

                              GREG
               On my mother's life.

                              ANNETTE
                    (beat)
               Okay...

32   INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         32

     Sebastian drives down the highway towards Manhattan. He holds
     his cell phone in one ear.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That nosey bitch. Are you sure?

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

33   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           33

     Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight.

                              GREG
               Positive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did you do everything I asked you to?

                              GREG
               Yes.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her I never said I love you
               before?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her that people are jealous
               cause I'm loaded?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               And you think she bought it?

                              GREG
               I'm pretty sure she did.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pretty sure or sure sure?

                              GREG
               She bought it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll be in touch.

     Click. The line goes dead.

34   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 34

     Kathryn is sitting in front of the television, scowling.

     ON TV - A HIDDEN VIDEO OF RONALD AND CECILE IN THE
     VALMONT LIVING ROOM.

     Ronald plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" at the piano
     while Cecile listens and sways to the music.

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM -

                              KATHRYN
               Enough with the music. Fuck her
               already.

     She throws a magazine at the television. Sebastian bursts
     into the living room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You would not believe what--

                              KATHRYN
               Shhh.

     ON TELEVISION - RONALD FINISHES THE SONG. CECILE STANDS
     AND APPLAUDS. RONALD TAKES A BOW.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               That was beautiful.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Almost as beautiful as you.

     Cecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Well, I guess it's getting late.
               Please thank Kathryn for the use of
               her Steinway.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               I'll see you tomorrow.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Absolutely.

     He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Idiot!

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image.

                              KATHRYN
               What's wrong with you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You ready for this? I've recently
               discovered that our good friend Mrs.
               Caldwell is the one who sent the
               letter to Annette urging her to stay
               away from me.

                              KATHRYN
               Interesting.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I now plan to devote all my energies to
               destroying the douche bag. Any luck
               corrupting her daughter?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Call Cecile up and get her to come over.
               I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.

     She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and
     Cecile on the television.

                              KATHRYN
               The plot thickens. It appears that
               Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love
               that.

                              KATHRYN
               Not to mention Court Reynolds.
               Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the
               speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's your plan of attack?

                              KATHRYN
               I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes
               ballistic and ends their relationship.
               Boo hoo.

                              SEBASTIAN
               But who will they turn to for help?

     Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile is planning to go away with Court
               next week. I'll need you to speed
               up her sexual awakenings.

     Sebastian rubs her shoulders.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm at your service.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh sis. You're so tense.

     Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra.
     He's met with no resistance.

                              KATHRYN
               I hate when things don't go my way. It
               makes me so horny.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I hate it too.

     He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her
     skirt.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (baby talk)
               Oh baby, your soaking.

                              KATHRYN
               I know.

     She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (seductively)
               Any luck with your girl?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Moving along quite well.

                              KATHRYN
               Have you succeeded in your task?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Any day now.

                              KATHRYN
               Well, let me know when you do. Until
               then.

     She takes his hand out from under her pants.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               No pootie.

     Kathryn smiles.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Sorry.

35   EXT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT                                     35

     A meter maid writes a ticket on Sebastian's car when she
     grabs her neck in pain.

36   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       36

     Sebastian closes his window and sets down a bb rifle with
     an infrared scope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Goodbye Mister Bond.

     He picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Hi, it's Sebastian. I didn't wake you
               did I?

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

37   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 37

     Annette sits in bed talking on the other end of the
     phone.

                              ANNETTE
               No, not at all.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to see how
               you're doing.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm... I'm alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How was your date?

                              ANNETTE
               It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to tell you
               I was thinking about you and I miss
               you. I'll let you go.

                              ANNETTE
               Wait, don't hang up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay?

                              ANNETTE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Reading.

     He crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad
     twins (GRETCHEN & MORA) are licking popsicles.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you reading?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of Human Bondage.

                              ANNETTE
               Somerset Maugham.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering
               my situation.

                              ANNETTE
               You're not gonna start that again.

     He takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the
     girls' butts.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No. I'm through with my childish
               games when it comes to you. Hold on,
               that's my other line.
                    (to the girls)
               Rub.

     They rub the oil on each other then turn to him and
     smile. He clicks the phone back on.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette that's my mom calling. Can I
               call you tomorrow?

                              ANNETTE
               Sure. Have a good night.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I will.

                                                       BACK TO:

38   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       38

                              GRETCHEN
               Of Human Bondage. You're such a
               bullshit artist.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even
               know what it is.

                              GRETCHEN
               Duh, it's a book.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know what it's about?

                              MORA
               Who cares. Books are for fags.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Books are for fags. I weep for the
               future.

39   EXT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        39

     Establishing shot.

40   INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        40

     A SALESWOMAN approaches Kathryn who's checking out an
     assortment of fur coats. The saleswoman holds up a
     beautiful dress.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Here's something you might like.

     Kathryn examines the label.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you carry any real fur?

                              SALESWOMAN
               No. All our fur is faux.

                              KATHRYN
               Of course. The animals. How silly of
               me.

     The saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers
     then looks over at a small child, staring at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (mouthing the words)
               Fuck off.

     She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell
     approaches.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I got your message and came as quick
               as I could.

                              KATHRYN
               I hope I didn't keep you from
               something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Not at all. What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               What about her?

                              KATHRYN
               Well... you promise you won't say
               anything to her. We've developed a
               friendship and...

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't
               drugs is it?

                              KATHRYN
               It's worse. I think there's something
               going on between Cecile and her music
               teacher.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Ronald? That's crazy.

                              KATHRYN
               I know. She's so young and he's so -

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Black.

     Kathryn reacts to her remark.

                              KATHRYN
               He's been sending her love letters that
               she hides under her doll house. I
               questioned whether or not to tell you,
               but something like this could destroy
               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               I hope I did the right thing in telling
               you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things
               with Court.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't thank you enough.

                              KATHRYN
               You will be discreet about this?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Absolutely.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Will that be cash or charge?

     Kathryn looks through her purse.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.

     Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let me get that for you.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh please. I can't have you do that.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It's the least I can do.

     Mrs. Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman.
     Kathryn turns to Mrs. Caldwell.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you.

41   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      41

     Ronald gives Cecile a cello lesson when Mrs. Caldwell
     bursts into the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Who the hell do you think you are?!

                              RONALD
               Excuse me.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I'm paying you to give cello lessons.
               Not to pervert my child.

                              RONALD
               Mrs. Caldwell I think you're
               misunderstanding something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Is that so?

     Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               You care to explain this then?

     Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry.

                              CECILE
               Where did you find those?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Margarita found them while cleaning
               your room.

                              CECILE
               Those are my letters!

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Don't you raise your voice at me. Go
               to your room, now.

     Cecile turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Now!

     Ronald nods and Cecile runs out of the room. Mrs.
     Caldwell turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               How dare you treat me with such
               disrespect. I got you off the streets
               and this is how you repay me?

                              RONALD
               Got me off the streets? I live on
               59th and Park.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Whatever. You are never to set foot
               in this house again and you are never
               and I mean never to see my daughter
               again. Is that understood?!

     Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs. Caldwell
     waits.

                              RONALD
               First of all, maam, I never touched
               your daughter and second, I would like
               to think that in these times someone
               of your status could look beyond
               racial lines.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Oh don't give me any of that racist
               crap. My husband and I gave money to
               Colin Powell.

                              RONALD
                    (sarcastic)
               I guess that puts me in my place.
               Thank you for the hospitality Mrs.
               Caldwell. It was a true awakening.

     He storms off.

42   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - ELEVATOR - DAY                   42

     Ronald rides down in the elevator.

                              RONALD
                    (angry)
               Took me off the streets?

     The elevator stops and the doors open. Sebastian and
     Kathryn stand in the doorway, wearing shades. Kathryn
     hands Cecile's letter.

43   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         43

     Ronald sits in a chair and reads Cecile's letter.
     Sebastian and Kathryn watch.

                              RONALD
               Wow. I never knew she had these kind
               of feelings.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You're a lucky guy.

                              RONALD
                    (eyes tear up)
               She really loves me.

     Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               What do you do? Tell her you love
               her.

                              RONALD
               But I can't even see her. She doesn't
               have her own phone, I don't even know
               her e-mail address.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and
               pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her
               another letter.

                              RONALD
               How will I get to her?

                              SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN
               We'll make sure she gets it.

                              RONALD
               Why are you being so good to me?

                              KATHRYN
               Because we want to see Cecile happy
               and we know you make her happy.

     She hands Ronald a pen and paper.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now you just march yourself into the
               study and start writing. We'll be there
               to check on you in a minute.

     Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while
     Kathryn picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who are you calling?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile.

     Sebastian hangs up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Before we go through with this, I just
               want you to be aware of the damage we're
               going to cause.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm aware.

     She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you really? I mean, we've done some
               pretty fucked up shit in our time but
               this... I mean, we're destroying an
               innocent girl. You do realize that.

                              KATHRYN
               What is that? Oh my God, it's your
               conscience.

     She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful
     of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on
     it.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Court Renolds is going down and if you're
               not going to help me, someone else will.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You amaze me.

                              KATHRYN
               Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you
               to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl
               it's wrong. Well let me tell you
               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.
               Do you think I relish the fact that I
               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty
               four seven, so I can be considered a
               "laaaady." Do you think I take great
               delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so
               wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child."
               "Kathryn is going to make an excellent
               wife one day."
                    (beat)
               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the
               upper East Side and sometimes I want to
               kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy
               being a part of the weaker sex and for
               that reason everyone around me is going
               to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis
               Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you
               out?

     Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and
     dials.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright,
               stop crying. I understand. Hold on for
               Sebastian.

     She hands the phone to Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
               very carefully. I have a letter from
               Ronald that he asked me to give to
               you. Now I can't exactly bring it to
               your house, since your mother
               despises me so here's what we're going
               to do.

44   CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              44

     The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques
     and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile
     lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it,
     dressed in sweats.

45   MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT                                   45

     Cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting
     taxi.

46   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       46

     Cecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter
     while Sebastian fiddles with a camera.

                              CECILE
               Finished.

     She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Excellent.

                              CECILE
               You think he'll like it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               He'll love it.

     He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Just taking your photo.

                              CECILE
               I look terrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes
               don't do you justice. Why don't you
               take them off.

     Cecile gasps.

                              CECILE
               I'm getting out of here.

     She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry that was out of line.

                              CECILE
                    (scared)
               I want to go home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just kidding.

                              CECILE
                    (eyes watering)
               I want to go home.

     He moves toward the phone

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom
               and have her come pick you up.

                              CECILE
               My mom? Don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't 
               know you're here. In fact, you're
               grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
               shitload of trouble for this.
               I think I should call her anyway.

     Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms
     around his legs.

                              CECILE
               Please please please. I'll do
               anything. Just don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile, all I want to do is give you a
               kiss.

                              CECILE
               And then I can go home?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of course. I'm not a monster.

     Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her
     feet.

                              CECILE
               Just a kiss, right?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I swear.

     She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the
     string holding up her sweats and pulls it open.

     Cecile bolts up.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You promised to let me kiss you.

                              CECILE
               But -

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pointing at her lips)
               I don't want to kiss you here. I want
               to kiss you there.

     Sebastian points to her crotch. She moves her hands to
     her sweats and looks up at him. Sebastian shrugs.

     Cecile pulls the string to her sweats. They fall to the
     floor.

47   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - DAY           47

     Mrs. Caldwell enters the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to
               be late for the -

     She notices the bed is empty.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

     She walks over the bathroom door and knocks.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               I'm in the bath, mom.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs.
               Rosemond's before lunch.

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               Okay.

48   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BATHROOM - DAY          48

     Cecile stands in front of her mirror, crying. She applies
     make-up to several hickeys on her neck. She XXX down
     her shirt and grimaces. She sticks her finger the make-
     up bottle, then puts her hand down her shirt.

49   EXT. ESTATE - TERRACE - DAY                                49

     Aunt Helen, Annette, Mrs. Caldwell and Cecile are having
     lunch. Cecile is wearing a turtle neck.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It was nice of you to invite us up
               for the weekend, Helen.

                              AUNT HELEN
               More the merrier.
                    (to Cecile)
               Is everything alright my dear?

                              CECILE
               I'm just not feeling well.

     Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Afternoon ladies.

     Cecile is stunned that he's there. Sebastian takes a
     seat at the table.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I didn't know you'd be here,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't planning on it, but being
               such a lovely day, why waste it in the
               city. Anyone for tennis?

     He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket.

     Cecile stands and rushes into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with her?

     No one knows.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Would you excuse me for a minute?

     Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (concerned)
               I hope she's alright.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I better go check on them.

     Aunt Helen stands and enters the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alone again.
                    (beat)
               What are you up to today?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm doing some volunteer work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need any company?

                              ANNETTE
               You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm
               trying to change here. You could be
               supportive.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Okay.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Babe, you're looking at the next Mother
               Teresa.

     Annette shakes her head and laughs.

50   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    50

     Cecile talks on the phone.

                              CECILE
               Please. I need you. I don't know what
               to do. You're the only one I can talk
               to.

51   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 51

     Kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll be there in a few hours.

     She hangs up the phone and smiles.

52   EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY                                 52

     Establishing shot.

53   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - DAY                       53

     A NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall.

                              NURSE
               It's really nice when the young people
               help out. Most of our patients don't
               have any family nearby.

     They stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his
     hospital bed.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for
               you.

     Sebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops
     him.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Actually Sebastian, you're going to be
               spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman.

     The Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the
     hall. Annette waves "bye bye" to him.

54   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MR. GOTTLIEB'S ROOM - DAY           54

     Annette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book
     of poetry.

55   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MRS. SUGARMAN'S ROOM - DAY          55

     A senile MRS. SUGARMAN sits in bed, while Sebastian does
     a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her. He smokes
     a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies
     next to her on the bed.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Did I ever tell you the time when my
               late husband sent me -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, you already did.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

     Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Right after we played backgammon.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               We played backgammon?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Uh huh. You beat me three times.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Excuse me?

     He turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said, do you want some water?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Oh... no thank you...

     There's a knock at the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come in.

     Annette and the nurse enter.

                              NURSE
               How we doing in here?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I won three games of backgammon.

     Sebastian smiles at Annette, who smiles back.

56   INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         56

     Sebastian and Annette drive towards the estate.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's weird. I actually feel good about
               myself. Can we do this again next week?

                              ANNETTE
               Oh please.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               "I actually feel good about myself?"

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              ANNETTE
               You must take me for a real idiot.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't.

                              ANNETTE
               You're going to tell me that you had a
               good time with the old lady.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I did. We played three games of backgammon
               and...

     She throws him a look.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking
               mind. I hate doing charity.

                              ANNETTE
               That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad
               person.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes it does.

                              ANNETTE
               No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being
               honest with me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sighs)
               I can't win with you.

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about winning. You know what
               your problem is? You take yourself way
               too seriously.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do not.

                              ANNETTE
               Lighten up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am lighten. Can we drop this?

                              ANNETTE
               Fine.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you doing? Stop it, it's
               distracting.

     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Cut it out.

     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.

                              ANNETTE
               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No.

                              ANNETTE
               No?

     She makes the face again. He laughs.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Stop that.

     She laughs with him.

                              ANNETTE
               There's hope for you, yet.

     She reaches out and holds his hand. He squeezes it.

57   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    57

     Cecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              CECILE
               Who is it?

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               It's Kathryn.

     Cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands
     there with a worried look on her face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Are you okay?

                              CECILE
               No.

     Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is
     crying.

                              KATHRYN
               Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.

                              CECILE
               Something awful happened last night.

                              KATHRYN
               What do you mean?!

                              CECILE
               I... I don't think you want to know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you have to tell me.

                              CECILE
               It involves your brother. He... took
               advantage of me.

                              KATHRYN
               Does your mother know?

                              CECILE
               If she knew, she'd kill me. It
               happened at your house last night.

                              KATHRYN
               Why didn't you do something?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               So, let me get this straight. You
               came over to our house late last night
               and he forced intercourse on you.

                              CECILE
               Well... not exactly.

                              KATHRYN
               He made you give him a blow job.

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well what then?

     Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               He ate you out?

                              CECILE
               If that's what you call it.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, I think you're going to have
               a hard time crying rape if that's all
               he did.

                              CECILE
               What do I do then?

                              KATHRYN
               Well did you like it?

                              CECILE
               Well... I don't know - it was weird.
               At first it felt icky, then it felt
               kind of okay. Then, I started getting
               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you had an orgasm.

                              CECILE
               I did?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.

                              CECILE
               I am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.

                              KATHRYN
               Now listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
               instruct you.

                              CECILE
               I don't love him. I love Ronald.

                              KATHRYN
               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
               Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
               many people as possible.

                              CECILE
               But that would make me a slut.
                    (beat)
               Wouldn't it?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
               that nobody talks about it.

     Cecile takes the information in.

                              CECILE
               It's like a secret society.

                              KATHRYN
               That's one way of looking at it.

                              CECILE
               Cool.

58   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 58

     Annette sits on the grass reading Gabriel Garcia
     Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. She puts the book
     down and wipes a tear from her eye.

59   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       59

     Sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars.
     Kathryn enters his room.

                              KATHRYN
               I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I
               don't think she'll be giving you
               anymore problems.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yippy.

                              KATHRYN
               Who are you spying on?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Take a look for yourself.

     He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the
     window.

                              KATHRYN
               That her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.
                    (sarcastic)
               Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset
               by the big bad book.

     Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up.

                              KATHRYN
               What's your problem?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's really getting to you, isn't
               she?

                              SEBASTIAN
               If you must know, yes. I don't know
               what to do. I can't stand that holier
               than thou bullshit and yet, I'm
               completely infatuated with her.
                    (beat)
               She made me laugh.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're losing your bet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not losing the bet. It's just
               taking longer than I expected.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you mind if I take my new Porsche
               for a ride?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, the only thing you're going to
               be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse
               me, I have some work to do.

     He storms out of the room.

60   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 60

     Sebastian walks over to Annette, who continues to read her
     book. She notices him and sets the book down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Am I bothering you?

                              ANNETTE
               Not at all. Have a seat.

     He sits down next to her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't tell me you finished The
               Fountainhead already?

     She nods. He points to her book.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Great book. What's the guy's name,
               Florentino...

                              ANNETTE
               Florentino Ariza.

     Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles
     around.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend
               of Florentino.

                              ANNETTE
               Who's Monsieur Philipe?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't know Monsieur Philipe?

     Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (low voice)
               Bonjour mademoiselle.

                              ANNETTE
                    (laughs)
               Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               You are very pretty. I would like to
               kiss you.

     The puppet kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               Oooo, that felt good.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

     He kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               That felt good too. I will kiss you
               all over.

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               I am too.

     He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know what? I don't take it back.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you doing this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Because I'm in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought you said we were going to be
               friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't handle it. I can't keep my
               feelings bottled up like you. Can you
               honestly tell me that you feel nothing
               for me? ... Tell me!

                              ANNETTE
               I have feelings for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
               It's not like you have a husband,
               unless your married to Jesus.

                              ANNETTE
               That's not fair.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why can't we be together?

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               You really want to know?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               It's because I don't trust myself with
               you.
                    (beat)
               I took a vow and because of you I'm
               tempted to break it. Don't destroy that
               for me. Please.

     She hurries off.

61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61

     Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (frustrated)
               Shit.

     He hears the shower running from the bathroom.

62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62

     Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out
     from the shower curtain.

                              CECILE
               Want to join me?

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (indifferent)
               Some other time, Cecile.

     He leaves the room. Cecile looks confused. A moment
     passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What am I, an idiot?

     Cecile smiles.

63   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63

     Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed. Sebastian smokes a
     cigarette and writes in his journal.

                              CECILE
               Am I suppose to be this sore?

                              SEBASTIAN
               For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

     A moment of silence.

                              CECILE
               I like it better when I'm on top.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. This is what I like to call
               quiet time. This is time when we
               reflect on what we've done.

                              CECILE
               I'm sorry.

     She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               Something's bothering you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You think?

                              CECILE
               Is it me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, you were fine.

     SEBASTIAN'S P.O.V. - He looks out on the balcony, where
     Kathryn is eavesdropping. They make eye contact and she
     waves.

                              CECILE
               It's that girl, Annette.

     He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes
     the blinds.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               You love her, don't you? It's okay.
               I don't love you either. I love Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm getting out of here.

     Sebastian heads to the bathroom.

                              CECILE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I'm taking a shower.

                              CECILE
               Need any company?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               No.

                              CECILE
               Want a blow job?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               Good night Cecile.

                              CECILE
                    (under her breath)
               Prude.

64   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 64

     Annette is reading in bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              ANNETTE
               Come in.

     Sebastian enters the room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I just came to say goodbye.

                              ANNETTE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Back to the city. I may take off to
               Europe for the rest of the summer. I
               just can't handle it around here.

                              ANNETTE
               I think that's for the best.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Good for you.

                              ANNETTE
               Sebastian, please. I don't want us to
               end on bad terms.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I'm afraid you don't have a
               choice in the matter. You make me
               sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't
               associate with hypocrites.

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               How am I a hypocrite?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh please Annette. You spend all your
               time preaching about waiting for love.
               Well here it is. Right in front of you,
               but you're going to turn your back on
               it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
               where we can get married. If we were,
               I'd propose, but that's not going to
               happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
               I'll move on, but you... you're going
               to have to live with yourself knowing
               you've turned your back on love. And
               that makes you a hypocrite.

     Sebastian heads to the door.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice life.

     Annette races toward him and throws her arms around him.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sobbing)
               Please don't go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get off me.

     She kisses him passionately.

                              ANNETTE
               I... I want you.

     Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed.

     She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian
     stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up
     as she continues to undress.

     Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry, I can't.

     A pained look crosses her face. Sebastian leaves the
     room and closes the door.

65   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     65

     Sebastian closes the door and leans against it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes
     over to a mirror at looks at himself.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Get it together you pussy.

     A stern look comes over his face. He smiles, then walks
     away.

66   EXT. ESTATE - FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY                         66

     A cab pulls up to the house. The front door opens and a
     crying Annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into
     the cab. She closes the door and the cab pulls away from
     the house. WE PAN up to a second story window where
     Kathryn is looking down and smiling.

67   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       67

     Sebastian lies sleeping in his bed. His journal lies
     beside him. A FEATHER tickles his nose. He stirs awake
     and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him.

                              KATHRYN
               Morning!

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sarcastic)
               Morning.

                              KATHRYN
               So? How'd it go last night?

                              SEBASTIAN
               With who?

                              KATHRYN
               Well I know how it went with Cecile.
               She won't shut up about it. How'd it
               go with Mrs. Jesus?

     Sebastian sits up in bed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               If your asking if I nailed her the
               answer is no.

                              KATHRYN
               She shot you down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Exactly the opposite.

                              KATHRYN
               So what went wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know. She was lying on the bed,
               ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I
               was... I just didn't feel right about
               it.

                              KATHRYN
               You're telling me you had the chance to
               fuck her and you didn't. God are you a
               chump.

                              SEBASTIAN
               A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to
               be rectified.

     He climbs out of bed and puts on his robe. He starts out
     the door, when -

                              KATHRYN
               If you're heading towards her room, you
               won't find her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?

                              KATHRYN
               You don't know?
                    (big smile)
               She left thirty minutes ago.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where'd she go?

                              KATHRYN
               She wouldn't say. She apologized to
               your aunt and told her she was going
               to stay with some friends.
                    (beat)
               You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has
               come to her senses and she will never
               go near you again.

     Sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               We'll see about that.

68   INT. GREG'S DORM ROOM - DAY                                68

     A shrine to hot babes, who's posters adorn the walls. Greg
     is busy dumping muscle magazines, several issues of Teen
     Beat and some Musical Theater CDs into a trash bag when the
     phone rings. He answers it.

                              GREG
               Hello.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

69   EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. PORSCHE - DAY                            69

     Sebastian is talking on his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Is she with you?

                              GREG
               Who is this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?

                              GREG
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?!

                              GREG
               I don't know. Why don't you leave her
               alone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in
               two seconds if you don't tell me where
               she is.

                              GREG
               I told you I don't know.

                              SEBASTIAN
               One.

                              GREG
               Alright. She's staying with some
               friends of her parents. The O'Sheas.
               She caught the train twenty minutes ago
               into Grand Central.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Grand Central. You better not be
               fucking with me cause it's your ass on
               the line.

     Sebastian clicks off his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Motherfucker.

     He bangs on his dashboard.

70   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                         70

     The Porsche weaves in and out of traffic on it's way to
     the city.

71   INT. TRAIN CONCOURSE - DAY                                 71

     A group of passengers exit the train. Annette is among
     them. She stops when she SEES -

     Sebastian, standing in the distance.

     Annette stops in her tracks. She drops her bag, rushes
     over to him and embraces him. Sebastian's cruel demeanor
     drops, when he realizes how happy she is to see him. He
     looks her in the eyes and smiles. They kiss.

72   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         72

     Sebastian carries a laughing Annette into the room. They
     continue to kiss and he carries her over to the table.

     He sets her down and accidentally knocks over a lamp.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooops.

     They both laugh. They kiss some more, then start to
     unbutton each other's clothes. Sebastian struggles with
     her pants' button.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Fuck this.

     He picks her up again and moves to the bed. They
     collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Suave.

     Annette cracks up. Sebastian reaches up and YANKS her
     down on top of him. They both laugh, then kiss.

74   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       74

     Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he
     sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

     She walks over to him and kisses him.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You alright?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm fine. I have to get going to my
               friends' house.
                    (beat)
               Was it --

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was perfect.

     She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in
     his.

75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75

     Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the
     hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's
     REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.

77   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     77

     Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the
     hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He
     grabs her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You work way to hard. Here.
                    (hands her a wad of money)
               Take the day off. Merry Christmas.

     Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down
     the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Slower.

     Sebastian leans against the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               A little to the left. Look, pretend
               like you're writing the alphabet.
               A... B... mmm, stay on B.

     Sebastian knocks on the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               One second.

     Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from
     inside the bedroom.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Come in.

78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78

     Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed,
     wearing only her bathrobe.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Bad time?

                              KATHRYN
               Kind of.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you obviously wanted me to
               witness your little adventure or else
               you wouldn't have invited me in.

     Sebastian walks toward the closet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Who is our little friend so
               inexperienced that you have to resort
               to the alphabet game?

     He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there
     covering his genitals with his hands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Well, well, well.

                              RONALD
               It's not what it seems like.

     Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves:

                              SEBASTIAN
               Say hi to Cecile.

     Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him.

                              KATHRYN
                    (calling out)
               Call me.

     Sebastian throws Kathryn a look.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You can't have all the fun.

     Sebastian sits on the bed.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You seem to be in a good mood.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am.

     A big grin appears on Sebastian's face

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes.

                              KATHRYN
               Tell me all the details.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... Fantastic.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on. For her first time?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. That's the amazing part of
               it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du
               Soleil acrobatics, just standard
               missionary stuff, but it was... ah
               forget it. I'm going to sound like a
               Hallmark card.

                              KATHRYN
               No, tell me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... it was like the emotional
               part outweighed the physical part.

                              KATHRYN
               Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
               the birds chirping.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mock, mock, mock.

     She places her hand on his crotch.

                              KATHRYN
               So I assume you've come here to make
               some arrangements.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Some other time.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not in the mood.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're leaving?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It clearly is why.

                              KATHRYN
               I want to fuck.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And I don't.

     He leaves and slams the door behind him.

79   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         79

     Sebastian talks on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll pick you up in an hour. I love
               you too.

     He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, I'm not.

                              KATHRYN
               P-whipped, p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's wrong with you? Why are you
               acting this way?

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
               in love with her. You don't love me
               anymore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
               contest.

                              KATHRYN
               At first it was, but now it's become
               something bigger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
               always loved you.

                              KATHRYN
               Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't believe you're reacting this
               way. You're just saying this because
               you lost the bet.

                              KATHRYN
               Is that what you think?

     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
     aside, spreading her legs.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright, come on, let's get it over
               with. But mark my words, this is the
               only time it'll happen.

     She picks up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
               me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
               make some phone calls.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's not fair. You're taking all the
               fun out of it.

                              KATHRYN
               Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
               If not for me, then do it for you.
               Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
               turned you into jelly. What do you want
               to be, one of those losers who walk
               down the halls holding hands and
               smiling. People used to respect you.
               They feared you and now you're going to
               throw that all away.

     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but
               now he's just another love-struck
               faggot. One of the many.

80   EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY                                80

     A taxi drives down the street.

81   INT. TAXI - DAY                                            81

     Kathryn and Sebastian sit in the back seat. Her arm is
     around his. Sebastian looks nervous.

                              KATHRYN
               Why so nervous?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I've never done this before.

                              KATHRYN
               How have you dumped girls in the past?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Screening calls. Any suggestions?

                              KATHRYN
               I knew this guy last summer in the
               Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the
               time were madly in love with each
               other. But she had this huge weight
               problem. His friends taunted him
               mercilessly about it. You know, "How
               do you breathe when she sits on your
               face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
               be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
               "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm
               completely fucked up."
                    (beat)
               Poor fatty never had a chance.

82   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       82

     The cab pulls up to the curb. Sebastian gets out and
     heads into the building. Kathryn leans out the window.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't be weak.

     The cab drives off.

83   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY             83

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. A woman (MRS. O'SHEA)
     answers the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi. Is Annette at home?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               You must be Sebastian. I've heard such
               nice things about you.

     He smiles.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (cont'd)
                    (calling out)
               Annette.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Come on in.

84   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                        84

     Sebastian closes the door behind him. Annette enters the
     room.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Well, I'm going to head back to the
               kitchen. You two have fun.

     Mrs. O'Shea mouths "He's cute" to Annette. Annette
     smiles and nods. Mrs. O'Shea leaves the room.

                              ANNETTE
               Would you like a tour?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sure.

     She takes his hand and leads him down the hall.

85   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY         85

     They enter a guest room.

                              ANNETTE
               And this is my room.

     She closes the door behind them. She smiles and kisses
     him.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You think we can be quiet?

     She embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless.

                              SEBASTIAN
               This isn't working out for me anymore.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Yeah, me neither.

     She looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's not you, it's me. I'm completely
               fucked up.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you saying?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why aren't you understanding?

                              ANNETTE
               I love you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. I wish I felt the same.
               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
               completely fucked up.

     Annette bursts into tears.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you trying to hurt me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
               see what you were like in bed.

     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
     his hand.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
               would appreciate you acting like a
               total psychopath.

     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't know how to love.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't even know me. The fact of the
               matter is there is some one I love.
               She's smarter, prettier... you don't
               even compare to her. The only reason I
               am here is because she wants us to be
               exclusive.

                              ANNETTE
               But you knew this was important to me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, your virginity? Well that's over
               now.

     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
     towards her.

                              ANNETTE
               Please go.

     He opens the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.

     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette
     continues to sob.

86   EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               86

     A cab driver carries several shopping bags out of a cab.

87   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     87

     Kathryn walks down the hallway and enters her room.

88   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           88

     The room is dark. Kathryn flips on the light.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus.

     Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
     journal in hand.

                              KATHRYN
               A little melodramatic, don't you think.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I have a flair for drama.

                              KATHRYN
               Mind if I ask what you're doing in my
               room?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You wanted an answer to your question.

                              KATHRYN
               Annette?

     He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
     crying.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Devastated beyond repair. I doubt
               she'll ever trust a man again.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

     He holds up a bottle of champagne.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I thought we should celebrate.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm
               expecting some company.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald?

                              KATHRYN
               Not that it's any of your business but
               yes.

     Sebastian holds up a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               From Ronald.

     Kathryn takes the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I haven't had a chance to read it, but
               I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
               yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
               Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
               friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
               You see, I expected your sort of
               bullshit so I took the liberty of
               phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
               they're having a little get together
               in my love shack at the Grand Central
               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
               over you, but I promised him I would
               see you through your crisis.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you. Now, where were we?

     POP goes the champagne cork.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oh yeah, the celebration.

     He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
     and hands one to Kathryn.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What shall we toast to?

                              KATHRYN
               To my triumph, of course.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Not my choice of toast, but it's your
               call. To your triumph over Annette.

     Kathryn giggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's so funny?

                              KATHRYN
               Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her.
               It's over you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come again?

                              KATHRYN
               You were very much in love with her and
               you're still in love with her. But it
               amused me to make you ashamed of it.
               You gave up on the first person you
               ever loved because I called you names.
               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
               you chose me over her, but please
               understand, I never loved you,
               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
               toy I play with. And now you've
               completely blown it with her. I think
               that's the saddest thing I've ever
               heard.
                    (smiles)
               Cheers.

     She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
     drink. He looks ill.

                              SEBASTIAN
               In any event, you still owe me my
               reward.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't
               fuck losers.

     Sebastian slaps her across the face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You motherfucker!

     She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
     fall to the ground.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Nobody hits me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Calm down.

     He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.

                              KATHRYN
               Get off me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               Will you calm down?

                              KATHRYN
               Fine! Get off me!

     He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
     breaths.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.

                              KATHRYN
               I accept. Now get out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get out? We had an arrangement.

                              KATHRYN
               Didn't you hear what I said?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't care what you said, we had an
               agreement. You've slept with half of
               the borough so don't tell me you're
               being choosy.

                              KATHRYN
                    (screaming)
               Get out!

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm giving you to the count of three to
               plop your ass down on the bed.

                              KATHRYN
               And if I don't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then I will consider it a declaration
               of war. One. Two... three.

                              KATHRYN
               I think you have your answer.

                              SEBASTIAN
               War it is.

     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind
     him.

89   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         89

     Sebastian paces while talking on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's desperate that I talk to her.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I've already told you, she's not home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well please leave a message that I
               called.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I'll do that.

     He hangs up the phone and THROWS it into a mirror, which
     SMASHES.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He collapses on his bed and buries his face in his hands.
     Exhausted he looks up and sees his journal lying on the
     floor. He picks it up and flips through it.

90   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     90

     Sebastian walks down the street carrying a small package.
     He enters an apartment building.

91   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT           91

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. Mrs. O'Shea answers the
     door.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               What do you want?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I need to talk to Annette.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know where she is?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know when she'll be back?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Later. Listen, we're entertaining
               some guests so -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Annette! Annette!

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Young man, I already told you she's
               not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Could you please see that she
               gets this.

     He hands her the package.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I'll do that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's really important.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I understand. Good night.

     She closes the door.

92   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - NIGHT                      92

     Mrs O'Shea turns away from the door towards Annette,
     who stands in the hallway.

93   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         93

     Kathryn sits in a chair doing her nails. She checks her
     watch, takes a moment and makes herself upset. She picks
     up the phone and dials.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

94   INT. RONALD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              94

     Ronald is sleeping. The phone rings. He awakens and
     answers it.

                              RONALD
               Hello.

                              KATHRYN
                    (voice cracking)
               Ronald?

                              RONALD
               Yeah?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Kathryn.

     Ronald sits up, nervous.

                              RONALD
               Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

     She cries.

                              RONALD
               What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

                              RONALD
               What do you mean?

                              KATHRYN
               I think he's high on drugs. He hit me,
               then took off. I'm afraid to be alone.
               Please come over.

                              RONALD
               I'll be right there.

     He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants

                                                       BACK TO:

95   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           95

     Kathryn hangs up the phone. She instantly becomes calm and
     returns to doing her nails.

96   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       96

     Annette sits and stares at Sebastian's package.

     She picks it up and opens it. She takes out a journal
     and a letter. She opens the letter and reads it.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Dear Annette. Thank you for reading
               this letter. I don't know what I can
               possibly say to rectify the harm I have
               caused you. For once in my life I'm at
               a loss for words.

97   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       97

     Sebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               The truth of the matter is that being
               with you was the only time I have ever
               been happy. My whole life has been a
               joke. I prided myself on taking joy in
               others' misery.

98   INT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT (MONTAGE)                    98

     Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad
     and lonely.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
               in hurting the first person I loved. I
               wish more than anything I could take it
               back, but I guess that's not possible.

99   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       99

     Annette continues to read the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Enclosed is my most prized possession...
               my journal. For a long time I
               considered it my trophy. A sordid
               collection of my conquests. If you
               really want to know the truth, then
               please read it. No more lies.

100  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     100

     We PAN down the side of the building to the ground.
     Sebastian lies against the building waiting for Annette
     to return.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               A car is picking me up tomorrow and
               taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where
               we have a summer home. Nothing would
               make me happier than if you joined me.
               I'm a fucking wreck without you. If
               you're interested please meet me
               outside my building at nine. If not, I
               understand. Love, Sebastian.

101  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               101

     Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her
     story.

                              KATHRYN
               And when I confronted him about his
               affair with Cecile he told me it was
               none of my business. Then when I said
               "Well what about Ronald," he said you
               were nothing more than a stupid... the
               n word and that you deserved what you
               got...

                              RONALD
               And this happened before you and I
               hooked up?

                              KATHRYN
               It's been going on for a while.
                    (beat)
               Then he called me a disgrace to our
               family and that's when he hit me.

                              RONALD
               Racist piece of shit.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd be careful if I were you. God knows
               what he's up to.

                              RONALD
               He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass
               in.

                              KATHRYN
               Will you stay here for the night? You
               can leave in the morning. That's when
               my parents get back and --

                              RONALD
               Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

     Kathryn hugs him.

                              KATHRYN
               Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.

102  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       102

     A STREET CLEANING MACHINE drives past the apartment

103  INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY               103

     Sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby. The
     NIGHT DOORMAN taps him awake.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What time is it?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Eight o'clock. You got to go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did she show up?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Nope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you mind if I check upstairs?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               I can't have you do that, nor can I
               have you hanging around the lobby all
               day.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I understand. Thanks for letting me
               crash here.

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Don't worry about it.

     Sebastian stands and staggers out of the building.

104  EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               104

     Ronald walks out of the building and heads toward the
     corner.

     He stops when he SEES - Sebastian crossing the street.

                              RONALD
                    (under his breath)
               Son of a bitch.

     Sebastian walks toward Ronald, who blocks his path.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up at Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (tired)
               Hey Ronald.

                              RONALD
               It seems that you and I have some
               talking to do.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Can we do it later. I've had a really
               bad night and -

     Ronald SHOVES Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's your problem?

                              RONALD
               Where the hell do you come off hitting
               women?

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you talking about?

                              RONALD
               Kathryn. Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

                              RONALD
               Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, you don't know what you're
               talking about.

                              RONALD
               Don't know what I'm talking about? I
               know that you fucked Cecile.

     Sebastian says nothing.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               It's true, isn't it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, I'm sorry.

                              RONALD
               You bastard!

     Ronald TACKLES Sebastian to the ground. Ronald lands on
     top of him and hits in the mouth.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Ronald hits him again. Blood pours out of Sebastian's
     mouth. Sebastian is dazed. Ronald grabs him by the
     collar.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Sebastian takes a moment to catch his breath.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fuck you.

     He knees Ronald in the groin. Ronald screams in pain and
     falls over. Sebastian climbs to his feet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why don't you give me a chance to
               explain.

     Sebastian kicks him in the ass. Ronald falls over.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Don't you get it? We were all part of
               her game.

     Sebastian pins him to the ground. Ronald struggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm gonna let you up, but you have to
               give me a chance to explain. Understood?

     Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches
     his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES -

     Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the
     event.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette!

     Sebastian stands and races over to her, blindly crossing
     the street.

     Annette notices a speeding cab and -

                              ANNETTE
                    (pointing)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him
     dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the
     street.

     Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs
     into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock,
     He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. I'm okay.

     Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them.

                              ANNETTE
               Get an ambulance!

     The cab driver races back to his car. Sebastian looks up
     at Annette.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We're getting you to a hospital.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Holy shit.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're gonna be fine.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               It's alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. Everything's good.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

105  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 105

     Blaine, twenty high-school girls and several friends of
     the family are dressed in black, making polite conversation
     and consoling Sebastian's parents and his Aunt Helen.

     Mrs. Caldwell stands in the corner with Cecile and her
     husband, MR. CALDWELL.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Sad, sad, sad. To think of the
               opportunities that boy had. This should
               be a lesson to us all that our children
               need constant supervision.

     She puts her arm around Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (CONT'D)
               It's all about quality time.

106  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         106

     Annette enters Sebastian's room, now cleaned up. She
     walks around the room, taking it in, then approaches the
     window. She stares out of it for a moment.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               He loved that view.

     Annette turns and sees Kathryn at the door. She enters
     the room.

                              ANNETTE
               I can see why.

     Kathryn extends her hand.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm Kathryn.

                              ANNETTE
               Annette Harrison.

     They shake.

                              KATHRYN
               Have we met?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't think so.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you know Sebastian well?

                              ANNETTE
               You might say that.

                              KATHRYN
               Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your
               father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.

                              ANNETTE
               That's right.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sure you're going to love it there.

     Annette nods.

                              KATHRYN
               Are you okay?

                              ANNETTE
               I'll be fine.

                              KATHRYN
                    (beat)
               Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just
               came in here to get something of mine.

     Kathryn walks over to Sebastian's desk and takes the keys
     to his Porsche. She goes to leave, when she turns back to
     Annette.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You sure you're going to be alright?
               I'm here if you need a friend.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

                              KATHRYN
               Look, I know this sounds corny, but
               whenever I feel like I can't go on I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to Jesus and he helps me through
               the problem. Call me an anachronism,
               but -

                              ANNETTE
               Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              ANNETTE
               You heard me.

                              KATHRYN
               Who the hell do you think you are
               coming into my house and saying those
               things to me. My brother is dead, have
               some respect.

                              ANNETTE
               Kathryn, I know all about you and
               Sebastian.

                              KATHRYN
               Sebastian was a pathological liar. I
               wouldn't believe a word he -

                              ANNETTE
               I have his journal.

                              KATHRYN
               You what?

                              ANNETTE
               His journal. He sent it to me the day
               before he died. Everything about you is
               in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs,
               the menages, your bout with bulimia,
               the affair you had with your guidance
               counselor and how he gave you... eww.
               Let's see, then there's your coke
               problem... You still keep it in your
               crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't show it to anybody?

                              ANNETTE
               Actually, I was planning on running
               down to Kinkos. Do you think you could
               give me ride?

                              KATHRYN
               You can't do this to me. It could ruin
               me.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               I know.

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you
               once say that crying is a sign of
               weakness? I'm very disappointed in you.

     Kathryn continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Alright, stop crying. There's a bright
               side to this you know.

     Annette puts a comforting arm around her.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're going to be my pet project next
               year. You're going to do what I tell
               you to do, wear what I tell you to
               wear. You're going to befriend the
               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.
               Think of the social ramifications it
               will cause. You and I are going to turn
               this school around. And do you know why
               you're going to do it?
                    (beat)
               Cause your ass is mine.

     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully
     on the mouth, then shoves her back. Kathryn looks at her
     in horror.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We'll be in touch.

     She winks at Kathryn then leaves.

     CLOSE ON: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian's bed,
     utterly defeated.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Forgot something.

     Annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out
     of Kathryn's hands.

107  INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         107

     Annette races down the highway. She opens up the glove
     compartment and rifles through some cassettes. She takes
     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.

     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing "Goodbye To Love."

     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's
     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in
     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.

108  EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - AERIAL POV. - DAY                  108

     We MOVE off the Porsche and ascend into the air. The
     Porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a
     sea of cars. WE SEE the Manhattan skyline in the background
     as WE -

                                                       FADE OUT.

                              THE END
The Crying Game
 

The Crying Game


FADE IN:

EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

A loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a
Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris
Wheel turning round and round.

A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with
blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings
around a bowling pin.

                       JODY
            And that's cricket, hon.

An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in
his huge hands. He gives it to the girl.

                       JODY
            You want it?

                       GIRL
            Sure.

                       JODY
            Doesn't matter if you don't.

He puts his arm around her and drags her on.

                       JODY
            Jody won't be offended. Jody's never
            offended. What'd you say your name was?

                       GIRL
            Jude.

                       JODY
            Jude. Suits you, Jude.

                       JUDE
            The teddy bear?

                       JODY
            No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And
            it's June. Jude in June.

He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.



                                                               2.



                        JODY
          Gotta piss, Jude.

He holds her hand.

                        JODY
          Don't run off, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You don't know me, do you?

Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We
can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the
canvas, looking bored.

                        JODY
              (inside)
          What if I did?

                        JUDE
          You'd know I wouldn't run off.

She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her
eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-
haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.

                        JODY
          Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You didn't?

                        JODY
          And you know what?

                        JUDE
          Tell me, Jody

He staggers out, buttoning up.

                        JODY
          It's nice.

He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.

                        JUDE
          Not here.

                        JODY
          Who gives a fuck.

                        JUDE
          You never know.



                                                               3.



She pulls him over toward the water.

                       JODY
             I never know nothing.

                       JUDE
             People. They could be looking.

Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He
moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach,
under a train trestle.

                       JUDE
             Come and get me, soldier --

                       JODY
             Whatever you say, Jude...

He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms
around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,
fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow
falls across them.

CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He
turns around, drunkenly.

                       JODY
             What the fuck --

The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.

Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a
field.

Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing
among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around
him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.

INT. CAR - DAY

A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,
three in the back.

On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet
on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a
gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is
smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat
innocent.

                       FERGUS
             So what's your name, soldier?



                                                               4.



                       JODY
          Fuck you.

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - EVENING.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small
lean man, talks to him through the hood.

                       MAGUIRE
          The situation is simple. You're being
          held hostage by the Irish Republican
          Army. They've got one of our senior
          members under interrogation in
          Castleraigh. We've informed them that if
          they don't release him within three days,
          you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our
          guest until further developments. Have
          you anything to say?

Jody is motionless under the black hood.

                       FERGUS
          Give him a cup of tea.

                       MAGUIRE
          Do you want a cup of tea?

He still says nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a
plate and some food on it.

                       FERGUS
          See does he want some.

                       JUDE
          Do you want some food?

Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

Late at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is
sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.
Jude comes in, with a flashlight.



                                                               5.



                    FERGUS
          Hey -- what's he like?

                    JUDE
          Horny bastard.

                    FERGUS
          Did you give him it?

                    JUDE
          There are certain things I wouldn't do
          for my country.

                    FERGUS
          Have a look at him.

                    JUDE
          Can't.

                    FERGUS
          Poke him or something. See if he's still
          alive.

                    JUDE
          He's all right.

                    FERGUS
          Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.
          Have a heart.

She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her
foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so
slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like
lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,
throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.

                    JODY
          You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --

He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He
writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is
screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing
guns, screaming.

                    MAGUIRE
          Turn the fucking thing off --

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.

                    FERGUS
          You all right?



                                                               6.



                        JUDE
          Fucking animal.

She takes in huge gobs of air.

                        FERGUS
          You don't know that.

                        JUDE
          Fucking do. I had him all over me.

He touches her face.

                        FERGUS
          Tough work, that.

                        JUDE
          Someone's got to do it.

She rubs her hand on his chest.

                        JUDE
          Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of
          you.

She sidles closer, coming on to him.

                        JUDE
          And you know what, Fergus? One of you
          made me want it...

She puts her lips to his neck.

                        FERGUS
          Which one?

She doesn't answer. They embrace.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING.

A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the
house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward
a greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The
sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron
chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap.
Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He
holds one out toward him.



                                                               7.



                     FERGUS
           Eat something, would you?

                     JODY
           Can't.

                     FERGUS
           What do you mean you can't?

                     JODY
           Can't eat through a canvas bag.

Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is
revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats,
slowly.

                     JODY
           This is a farce, man.

                     FERGUS
           How is it a farce?

                     JODY
           I seen your fucking face.

                     FERGUS
           So, what do I look like?

                     JODY
           You're the one about five ten with the
           killer smile and the baby face.

                     FERGUS
           Am I?

                     JODY
           Yeah. And the brown eyes.

Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's
mouth.

                     JODY
           You're the handsome one.

Jody eats the last bits.

                     JODY
           Thank you, handsome.

                     FERGUS
           My pleasure.



                                                               8.



EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She
is carrying a pot of tea and two cups.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

It is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S
COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat.

                        JODY
          I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a
          Christian, will you?

Jude comes into view.

                        JODY
          Tell him to take the hood off, honey...

Jude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground.

                        FERGUS
          How did you know it was her?

                        JODY
          I can smell her perfume.

Jude pours out the tea.

                        JUDE
          See, if we took the hood off, we'd have
          to shoot you. As it is, you've got a
          fifty-fifty chance.

                        JODY
          Thought you liked me, bitch.

                        JUDE
          It was fun while it lasted.

                        JODY
          Nice lady.

His breathing becomes labored.

                        JODY
          Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.

                        FERGUS
          Can't we take it off?

                        JUDE
          Have to check with himself.



                                                             9.



Fergus gives her the gun.

                        FERGUS
          You look after him.

Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves.

                        JODY
          Don't leave me with her, man. She's
          dangerous...

Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters. Maguire and the others. Maguire has a
newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping.

                        MAGUIRE
          Made the front page. They'll move now,
          the fuckers.

                        FERGUS
          Request permission to take the hood off,
          Tommy.

                        MAGUIRE
          Why would you do that?

                        FERGUS
          The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

                        MAGUIRE
          So?

                        FERGUS
          And anyway, he's seen our faces.

                        MAGUIRE
          You sure?

                        FERGUS
          He described me down to a T. Knows what
          Jude looks like.

Maguire reads the paper.

                        FERGUS
          Tommy --



                                                            10.



                     MAGUIRE
          You're his keeper. If you don't mind him
          seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the
          only one he looks at.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

                     MAGUIRE
          It's your decision.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters.
He puts his arm casually around her.

                     FERGUS
          Leave us, Judie.

                     JUDE
          My pleasure.

She goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off.
Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes
in mighty gulps of air. He smiles.

                     JODY
          Thank you, soldier.

Fergus smiles.

                     JODY
          Never thought fresh air would taste this
          good.

Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips.

                     JODY
          Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be
          able to feed myself.

                     FERGUS
          No fucking way.

                     JODY
          Only joking.

Fergus drinks.

                     JODY
          You know, I was wrong about one thing.



                                                              11.



                          FERGUS
            What's that?

                          JODY
            Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no
            pinup.

                          FERGUS
            No?

                          JODY
            Nope. Not handsome at all.

                          FERGUS
            You trying to hurt my feelings?

                          JODY
            No. It's the truth.

                          FERGUS
            Well, I could say the same about you.

                          JODY
            Could you?

                          FERGUS
            But I won't. We're more polite around
            these parts.

                          JODY
            So I've noticed.

Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes
back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on
his lap.

                          JODY
            Hey --

                          FERGUS
            What is it now?

                          JODY
            You're going to have to do it, aren't
            you?

                          FERGUS
            Do what?

                          JODY
            Kill me.



                                            12.



           FERGUS
What makes you think that?

           JODY
They're going to let that guy die. And
you're going to kill me.

           FERGUS
They won't let him die.

           JODY
You want to bet?

           FERGUS
I'm not a gambling man.

           JODY
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't
just let me loose.

           FERGUS
Why can't we?

           JODY
Not in your nature.

           FERGUS
What do you know about my nature?

           JODY
I'm talking about your people, not you.

           FERGUS
What the fuck do you know about my
people?

           JODY
Only that you're all tough undeluded
motherfuckers. And that it's not in your
nature to let me go.

           FERGUS
Shut the fuck up, would you?

           JODY
And you know the funny thing?

           FERGUS
No, what's the funny thing?

           JODY
I didn't even fancy her.



                                                             13.



                       FERGUS
          Didn't look like that to me...

                       JODY
          She's not my type.

He looks at Fergus.

                       JODY
          C'mere.

                       FERGUS
          No.

                       JODY
          Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.

                       FERGUS
          What?

                       JODY
          My inside pocket.

Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's
inside pocket.

                       JODY
          Take out the wallet.

Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet.

                       JODY
          Open it.

CLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification
photograph.

                       JODY
          Inside. There's a picture.

Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites,
smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles.

                       JODY
          No, not that one. There's another.

Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful
black woman, smiling.

                       JODY
          Now she's my type.



                                                       14.



                      FERGUS
          She'd be anyone's type.

                      JODY
          Don't you think of it, fucker.

                      FERGUS
          Why not?

                      JODY
          She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit
          you.

                      FERGUS
          No?

                      JODY
          Absolutely not.

                      FERGUS
          She your wife?

                      JODY
          Suppose you could say that.

Jody chuckles.

                      FERGUS
          You make a nice couple.

                      JODY
          Don't I know it.

                      FERGUS
          So what were you fucking around for,
          then?

                      JODY
          You fuckers set me up. That bitch --

                      FERGUS
          She's a friend of mine

                      JODY
          Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar.
          I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here
          anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my
          hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't
          like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe
          I'll get to understand.

                      FERGUS
          What?



                                             15.



          JODY
What the fuck am I doing here.

          FERGUS
What the fuck were you doing here?

          JODY
I got sent.

          FERGUS
You could have said no.

          JODY
Can't. Once I signed up.

          FERGUS
Why did you sign up?

          JODY
It was a job. So I get sent to the only
place in the world they call you nigger
to your face.

          FERGUS
Shouldn't take it personally.

          JODY
    (He imitates a Belfast accent)
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No
use telling them I came from Tottenham.

          FERGUS
And you play cricket?.

          JODY
Best game in the world.

          FERGUS
Ever see hurling?

          JODY
That game where a bunch of paddies whack
sticks at each other?

          FERGUS
Best game in the world.

          JODY
Never.

          FERGUS
The fastest.



                                                           16.



                        JODY
          Well, in Antigua cricket's the black
          man's game. The kids play it from the age
          of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies
          from the age of five. Then we moved to
          Tottenham and it was something different.

                        FERGUS
          How different?

                        JODY
          Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .

Fergus looks at him.

                        JODY
          So when you come to shoot me, Paddy,
          remember, you're getting rid of a shit-
          hot bowler.

                        FERGUS
          I'll bear that in mind.

He keeps looking at him.

                        FERGUS
          And by the way, it's not Paddy. It's
          Fergus.

Jody smiles.

                        JODY
          Nice to meet you, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          My pleasure, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him.

                        FERGUS
          Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by
          that tree.

                        JODY
          Tree.

He walks toward it, breathing heavily.

                        JODY
          You've got to loosen my hands.



                                                           17.



                       FERGUS
          Can't.

                       JODY
          Well then, you're going to have to take
          my dick out for me, aren t you?

Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him.

                       JODY
          Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!

Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly.

                       JODY
          Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying --

Fergus takes Jody's penis out.

Jody takes two steps toward the wall.

                       JODY
          I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all
          over myself. Will you hold my hands for
          me.

Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward.
Jody now pisses with immense relief

                       JODY
          Now, that was worth waiting for.

                       FERGUS
          Hurry up, would you?

                       JODY
          These things take time, Fergus.

He shakes his body.

                       JODY
          It's amazing how these small details take
          on such importance...

He steps back.

                       JODY
          Now put it back in.

                       FERGUS
          Give us a break.



                                                            18.



                          JODY
             I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat.
             For fuck's sake, it's got no major
             diseases.

Fergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up.

                          JODY
             Thank you. I had a case of the clap two
             years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in
             all it's served me well.

                          FERGUS
             Shut up, would you?

                          JODY
             I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you,
             Fergus.

Fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody back to his chair.

                          JODY
             Fergus?

                          FERGUS
             Yeah?

                          JODY
             Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

He begins to laugh.

                          FERGUS
             The pleasure was all mine.

Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of
laughter.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over
his head.

Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus.



                                                              19.



                    MAGUIRE
          What the fuck is this?

                    FERGUS
          It's nothing. He's just got a sense of
          humor, that's all.

                    MAGUIRE
          You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth
          shut. Go in and get some sleep.

Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door.

                    JODY
          Yeah. Get some sleep.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking toward the house. He looks back and sees the
figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus sleeping.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody sleeping. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands,
watching him.

EXT. FARMHOUSE AND FIELDS - DAY

The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is
sitting where he sat before, stock-still.

                    FERGUS
          Did he talk?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Didn't make you laugh?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Here. Have some breakfast.

He hands Maguire a plate. Jody stirs.



                                                              20.



                    JODY
          Good morning, Fergus?

Maguire looks hard at him.

                    MAGUIRE
          So he knows your name?

                    FERGUS
          I told him.

                    MAGUIRE
          Are you all there?

He rises, and drags Fergus out the door.

                    FERGUS
          Back in a minute, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

                    MAGUIRE
          You'll have minimal contact with the
          prisoner, do you hear me?

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

                    MAGUIRE
          And do you know why?

                    FERGUS
          Why?

                    MAGUIRE
          Because tomorrow we might have to shoot
          him, that's why.

Maguire goes back to the house.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jody sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters.

                    JODY
          They giving you trouble, Fergus?

Fergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward
Jody



                                                           21.



                         JODY
             It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of
             people. Those who give and those who
             take.

Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to
feed him.

                         JODY
             Ah, take the thing off, man.

Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him.

                         JODY
             It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I
             prattle on, do you?

Fergus shakes his head and says nothing.

                         JODY
             I will take it by your silence that you
             don't.

He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody.

                         JODY
             Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the
             frog. Ever heard of them?

Fergus says nothing.

                         JODY
             Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he
             can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can,
             and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I
             give you a ride on my back, you'll go and
             sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would
             not be in my interest to sting you since
             as I'll be on your back we both would
             drown." Frog thinks about this logic for
             a while and accepts the deal. Takes the
             scorpion on his back. Braves the waters.
             Halfway over feels a burning spear in his
             side and realizes the scorpion has stung
             him after all. And as they both sink
             beneath the waves the frog cries out,
             "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for
             now we both will drown?" Scorpion
             replies, "I can't help it, it's in my
             nature."

Jody chuckles under his hood.



                                                           22.



                            FERGUS
              So what's that supposed to mean?

                            JODY
              Means what it says. The scorpion does
              what is in his nature. Take off the hood,
              man.

                            FERGUS
              Why?

                            JODY
              'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles
up at him.

                            JODY
              See? I was right about you.

                            FERGUS
              Don't be so sure.

                            JODY
              Jody's always right.

INT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.

Both men dozing in the heat.

                            JODY
              Where would you most like to be now, man?

                            FERGUS
              Doesn't matter where.

                            JODY
              Come on, man. If this shit was all over.

                            FERGUS
              Having a pint in the Rock.

                            JODY
              You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of
              something more alluring.

                            FERGUS
              Like what?

                            JODY
              Like having a pint in the Metro --

Fergus laughs.



                                             23.



              FERGUS
Having two pints in the Rock.

              JODY
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's
having a margarita.

              FERGUS
Who's Dil?

              JODY
My special friend.

              FERGUS
Oh, yeah.

              JODY
We got simple tastes, you and me.

              FERGUS
The best.

              JODY
But you fellas never get a break, do you?

              FERGUS
Do you?

              JODY
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're
finished. But you guys are never
finished, are you?

              FERGUS
We don't look on it like that.

              JODY
I've often wondered how you do it.

              FERGUS
Depends on what you believe in.

              JODY
What do you believe in?

              FERGUS
That you guys shouldn't be here.

              JODY
It's as simple as that?

              FERGUS
Yes.



                                                            24.



Jude enters.

                        JUDE
          Put that thing back on him, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          He's hot.

                        JUDE
          Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover
          the fucker up.

                        JODY
          Have you no feelings, woman?

                        JUDE
          You shut your face --

She pulls the hood down over him.

                        JUDE
          You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

                        JODY
          He's a good soldier, Jude.

She whacks him with a pistol.

                        JUDE
          I said shut the fuck up --

                        JODY
          He believes in the future --

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's
mouth, with blood now in his lips.

                        FERGUS
          Is it bad?

                        JODY
          No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know
          that, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
          I didn't.

                        JODY
          Some kinds of women are...



                                                          25.



                      FERGUS
            She can't help it.

                      JODY
            Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.

                      FERGUS
            You liked her?

                      JODY
            Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever
            she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.
            Will you think of her too?

                      FERGUS
            Don't know her.

                      JODY
            Want you to do something, Fergus.

                      FERGUS
            What?

                      JODY
            If they kill me --

                      FERGUS
            Don't think that way.

                      JODY
            But they will. As sure as night follows
            day. They have to. I want you to find her
            out. Tell her I was thinking of her.

Fergus is moved. He can't reply.

                      JODY
            See if she's all right.

                      FERGUS
            I don't know her.

                      JODY
            Take her picture. C'mere.

Fergus walks toward him.

                      JODY
            Take it. In the inside pocket.

Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her
picture.



                                                             26.



                        JODY
          Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

                        FERGUS
          I told you not to talk that way --

                        JODY
          Go to Millie's Hair Salon in
          Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a
          margarita. Don't have to tell her who you
          are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it --

The door opens. Maguire is there, with another.

                        MAGUIRE
          Volunteer?

Fergus turns toward him.

                        MAGUIRE
          We need you inside.

Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward,
takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in
his pocket.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others.

                        MAGUIRE
          We've had word. They've used every trick
          in the book on him. He's starting to
          talk. You're going to have to do it in
          the morning.

Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods.

                        MAGUIRE
          You OK about that?

                        FERGUS
          I'm a volunteer, am n't I?

                        MAGUIRE
          Good. I was beginning to have my doubts
          about you for the last few days.

                        JUDE
          Not the only one --



                                                          27.



                            MAGUIRE
              Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep
              tonight, Fergus.

                            FERGUS
              Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Request permission to guard the prisoner
              tonight --

                            JUDE
              You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              Shut the fuck up, Jude.

He turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's
shoulder.

                            MAGUIRE
              Why do you want to do that for?

                            FERGUS
              Would make me feel better about it.

                            MAGUIRE
              You sure about that?

                            FERGUS
              I'm sure.

                            MAGUIRE
              Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.

Fergus leaves.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody.

Jody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound
of crying.

                            FERGUS
              Don't.

                            JODY
              I'm sorry.



                                                              28.



The crying stops.

                        JODY
          Help me.

                        FERGUS
          How can I?

                        JODY
          I don't know. Just help me. Give me a
          cigarette.

Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's
hood so he can smoke.

                        JODY
          Don't even smoke, you know that? It just
          seemed the right thing to do.

Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above
his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips.
Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth.

                        FERGUS
          Go to sleep now.

                        JODY
          I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        JODY
          A story.

                        FERGUS
          Like the one about the frog?

                        JODY
          And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

                        FERGUS
          When I was a child...

                        JODY
          Yeah?

                        FERGUS
          I thought as a child. But when I became a
          man I put away childish things...

                        JODY
          What does that mean?



                                                             29.



                       FERGUS
          Nothing.

                       JODY
          Tell me something, anything.

Fergus is silent; his eyes wet.

                       JODY
          Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?

                       FERGUS
          Me? No, I'm not good for much...

EXT. FIELDS - MORNING.

The farmhouse covered in mist. The sun coming through it.

EXT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING.

Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the
chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. He checks
the chamber.

Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his
back, by the elbow.

                       FERGUS
          Stand up, now --

Jody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire.

                       MAGUIRE
          I wish to say on behalf of the Irish
          Republican Army --

Fergus turns with sudden fierceness.

                       FERGUS
          Leave him be --

He pulls Jody through the fields.

EXT. TREES - MORNING.

Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his
back.

                       JODY
          Take the hood off, Fergus --

                       FERGUS
          No.



                                                              30.



                     JODY
          I want to see a bit. Please, please.
          Don't make me die like an animal.

Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a
cut lip where Jude struck him.

Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward.
Fergus is all cold and businesslike.

                     JODY
          I'm glad you're doing it, do you know
          that, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          Why?

                     JODY
          Cause you're my friend. And I want you to
          go to the Metro --

                     FERGUS
          Stop that talk now --

                     JODY
          Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          The fastest.

                     JODY
          Faster than cricket?

                     FERGUS
          Cricket's in the halfpenny place.

                     JODY
          So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat
          you, is there?

                     FERGUS
          You won't run.

                     JODY
          But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a
          brother in the back --

Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands,
then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in
fury after him.

                     FERGUS
          JODY!!!



                                                              31.



Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.

                            FERGUS
              You stupid bastard --

                            JODY
              What you say, faster?

                            FERGUS
              I said you bastard -- stop --

                            JODY
              Got to catch me first --

Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody
sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He
laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing,
almost laughing.

                            JODY
              Used to run the mile, you know -- four
              times round the cricket pitch -- what was
              that game called?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

                            JODY
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him.

                            JODY
              Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit
              more wind --

Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on
him again.

                            JODY
              Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?

And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to
Fergus.

                            JODY
              Told you I was fast --

Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody



                                                             32.



                        JODY
             Don't do it.

And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits
Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air
and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt
and the huge wheels grind over him.

Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees
soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns
and runs.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as
he runs.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Tinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into
view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it,
shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Bullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the
masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the
others on the floor, scrambling for weapons.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging
branches till eventually he is hidden from sight.

EXT. CARNIVAL ON THE MONAGHAN BORDER - DAWN.

A forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields.

An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car
appears; and Fergus gets out of it.

                        TOMMY
             Fergus!

                        FERGUS
             You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're
             you keeping?

INT. CARAVAN - DAY

The old man pouring whiskey into a teacup.



                                                                33.



                        TOMMY
             You'll notice I've asked you nothing.

                        FERGUS
             That's wise, Tommy.

                        TOMMY
             All right, then. I like to be wise.

He pours Fergus more whiskey.

                        TOMMY
             So what do you need, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
             Need to go across the water.

                        TOMMY
             Do you now.

                        FERGUS
             Need to lose myself awhile.

                        TOMMY
             Aha.

He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette.

He puffs.

                        TOMMY
             There's a man I know ships cattle to
             London.

EXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING.

The ferry, churning into the sunset.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

INT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in
clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at
a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in
laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the
bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and
relentlessly, like a machine.

We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls
away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust
and the growing hole.



                                                              34.



Fergus's face, as he works.

The hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of
dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.

Fergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.

The hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The
dust begins to clear.

His face.

The jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a
cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the
green.

EXT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters
through a white door.

INT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country
boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers
of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the
soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus walking down a street looking for an address. Some
distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR
SALON.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looking in the
window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his
point of view, then Fergus walks inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Fergus enters. The door gives a loud ping.

                       A GIRL
             We're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil

She leaves the salon.

                       DIL
             You want something in particular?



                                                              35.



                        FERGUS
          Just a bit of a trim...

Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette.

                        DIL
          Come on...

She gestures toward a chair. Fergus sits down. She comes
toward him and fiddles with his hair.

She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins
to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo.

                        DIL
          Someone recommend you?

                        FERGUS
          In a way.

                        DIL
          Who?

                        FERGUS
          Guy I work with.

                        DIL
          What's his name?

Fergus can't think of an answer. The hands with the purple
nails run over his scalp.

                        FERGUS
          Doesn't the water get to your nails?

                        DIL
          What's it to you?

                        FERGUS
          Nothing.

Fergus, sitting up. She begins to cut.

                        DIL
          You American?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          Not English.



                                                              36.



                           FERGUS
             No.

                           DIL
             Scottish?

                           FERGUS
             How'd you guess?

                           DIL
             The accent, I suppose.

                           FERGUS
             And what's it like?

                           DIL
             Like treacle.

She imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs.

                           DIL
             Nice laugh.

Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds
a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks
like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them
is empty.

                           DIL
             That should make her happy.

                           FERGUS
             Who's she?

                           DIL
             Don't know. Who is she?

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through
the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her
hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He
walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.

The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of
high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy
clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door
and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub
called the Metro. Fergus follows.



                                                             37.



INT. METRO - EVENING.

Half full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way
through it.

                        BARMAN
          Hi, Dil

                        DIL
          Hiya, hon.

She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and
takes a seat.

                        BARMAN
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          A bottle of Guinness.

Dil, looking at Fergus.

                        DIL
          See that, Col?

                        COL
          See what, Dil?

                        DIL
          He gave me a look.

                        COL
          Did he?

Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink.

                        DIL
          Just cut his hair, you know.

                        COL
          Yeah?

                        DIL
          What you think?

                        COL
          Nice.

Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face
turned away, but sees him in the mirror.

                        DIL
          There, he did it again.



                                                             38.



                           COL
              Saw that one.

                           DIL
              What would you call it?

                           COL
              Now, that was a look.

She eyes Fergus in the mirror.

                           DIL
              Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.

The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus.

                           COL
              She wants to know do you want to know
              what she's drinking.

Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.

                           DIL
              A margarita.

The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at
Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her
the drink.

                           DIL
              Now he can look.... Ask him does he like
              his hair, Col.

                           COL
              She wants to know, sir, do you like your
              hair.

                           FERGUS
              Tell her I'm very happy with it.

                           DIL
              He's Scottish, Col.

                           COL
              Scottish?

                           FERGUS
              Yeah.

                           DIL
              What'd he say, Col?



                                                              39.



                         COL
           He agreed that he was.

                         DIL
           What do you think his name is?

                         COL
           I've no thoughts on the subject.

                         FERGUS
           Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         COL
           That's what he said. Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Hi, Jimmy.

                         FERGUS
           Hiya, Dil

A burly man sits down beside her. He puts his hand on her
knee.

                         MAN
           Sing the song, Dil --

She slaps the hand away.

                         DIL
           Fuck off, Dave.

                         DAVE
           C'mon, babe! You know what I like...
           Easy!

She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is
sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and
that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a
shadow.

Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow.
She shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by
the elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly
strikes her across the face with his open palm.



                                                              40.


She leans her head against a wall. Dave then puts his arms
around her, consoles her.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm. The street is
dilapidated, full of squats. They stop outside a door. Dil
opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk
inside.

Fergus stands there, observing.

A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her
shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of
Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse.
She stands absolutely still as he does so.

Fergus backs away, then walks off.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus, in bed. Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler,
running in slow motion, toward the camera. He releases the
ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily.

INT. SITE - NEXT DAY

Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He
imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a
voice interrupts him.

                        DEVEROUX
           So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?

Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type
in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is
Franknum, the cockney foreman.

                        FERGUS
           It's not Pat. It's Jim.

                        DEVEROUX
           Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as
           you remember you're not at Lords.

Fergus resumes work.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street
chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up.
Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap
colored bulbs are flashing around it.



                                                              41.



From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never
been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap
suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil. Col,
the barman, sees him and smiles.

                     COL
          So can we consider you a regular, sir?

                     FERGUS
          Is that good or bad?

                     COL
          Well, you get to say, The usual, Col.
          Things like that.

Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese
umbrellas toward him.

                     COL
          So let's call this the usual.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts.

                     COL
          No, no. It's on me.

Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by
implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts
the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the
way.

                     COL
          Take it out, if you want.

Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and
drinks with the other.

                     COL
          You came to see her, didn't you?

Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to
his left smiles at him.

                     COL
          Something I should tell you. She's --



                                                              42.



                       FERGUS
          She's what?

The barman looks up toward the stage.

                       COL
          She's on.

THE JUKEBOX.

A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by
Dave Berry, "The Crying Game."

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins,
making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a
stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes
to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice
on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing
who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange
movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands.

The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of
approval or derision we can't be sure.

Fergus watching.

Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song.
The crowd cheers.

Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar,
toward him.

                       DIL
          He's still looking, Col.

                       COL
          Persistent.

                       DIL
          Good thing in a man.

                       COL
          An excellent quality.

                       DIL
          Maybe he wants something.

                       COL
          I would expect he does.



                                                             43.



                      DIL
          Ask him.

                      COL
          Ask him yourself.

She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him.

                      DIL
          So tell me.

Fergus says nothing. He shrugs.

                      DIL
          Everybody wants something.

                      FERGUS
          Not me.

                      DIL
          Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned
          and quaint. Isn't it, Col?

Col shrugs.

                      DIL
          You old-fashioned?

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

The burly man comes up to her.

                      MAN
          Got the money, Dil?

                      DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                      DAVE
          You fucking promised.

                      DIL
          Did I?

                      DAVE
          You fucking did.

He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her
drink.

                      DAVE
          Didn't you? Well, come on!



                                                              44.



He drags her through the crowd. In the mirror, Fergus watches
them go. The barman eyes him.

                        COL
              It takes all types.

                        FERGUS
              So who's he?

                        COL
              He's what she should run a mile from.

                        FERGUS
              Then why doesn't she?

                        COL
              Who knows the secrets of the human heart.

Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.

EXT. PUB - NIGHT.

Fergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no
sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an
alley. He looks up it.

P0V - ALLEY.

We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her
roughly.

                        DAVE
              Don't be like that --

                        DIL
              You heard me --

She beats his arms away. Money falls on the ground. She
staggers away from him. He picks up the money, then runs
after her.

                        DAVE
              Got very fucking grand, haven't we --

He tries to pull her back.

                        DAVE
              Talk to me, you stupid bitch --

They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't
move an inch. She smiles.



                                                             45.



                        DIL
          Hi.

                        FERGUS
          Hi. You forgot your bag.

He holds it up to show her.

                        DIL
          Thank you.

                        DAVE
          Who the fuck is he?

                        DIL
          Jimmy.

                        DAVE
          It's him, isn't it?

                        DIL
          Maybe.

Dave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on
the ground.

                        DIL
          See, they get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
                 (from the ground)
          Cunt.

Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck.

                        FERGUS
          What was that?

                        DIL
          They all get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
          Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.

                        DIL
          Charming.

Dave grabs for her ankle. She kicks his hand away. Fergus
presses down his foot. He looks to Dil.

                        FERGUS
          What'll I do?



                                                          46.



                          DIL
            Break his neck.

Fergus presses his foot.

                          DIL
            No, don't.

She bends low to Dave.

                          DIL
            He's going to take his foot off slowly,
            David. Then you're to go home, like a
            good boy. You hear me?

                          DAVE
            Cunt.

But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs
his arm.

                          DIL
            Come on, honey.

She draws him away.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

They walk out of the alley.

                          FERGUS
            You all right?

                          DIL
            Yes, thank you.

                          FERGUS
            What was that all about?

                          DIL
            He wants me to perform for him.

                          FERGUS
            Perform?

                          DIL
            You know.

                          FERGUS
            You on the game?

                          DIL
            God no. I'm a hairdresser.



                                                              47.



Fergus looks back. Dave is rising.

                     FERGUS
          He's getting up.

                     DIL
          You can't leave me then, can you?

EXT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE DIL'S FLAT

Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs.

                     DIL
          You want me to ask you in, right?

                     FERGUS
          No, I didn't --

                     DIL
          But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud,
          but never cheap.

There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave,
holding his neck.

                     DAVE
          Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.

Dil leans close to Fergus.

                     DIL
          If you kissed me, it would really get his
          goat.

She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly.

                     DIL
          Now, if you asked me to meet you
          tomorrow, it would really drive him
          insane.

                     FERGUS
          Where?

                     DIL
          Half-five. At Millie's.

She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down
at Dave, who turns to leave.

EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus.



                                                             48.



                        DIL
          Give me that look again.

                        FERGUS
          What look?

                        DIL
          The one you gave me in the Metro.

Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She
holds them, with theatrical feeling.

                        DIL
          Darling, you shouldn't have.

She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a
classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon
pull back a curtain, and they all clap.

                        FERGUS
          What's that about?

                        DIL
          They're jealous.

                        FERGUS
          Why?

                        DIL
          I wonder.

She takes his arm and walks off with him.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks
on their table, then leaves.

                        DIL
          Now's the time you're meant to do
          something, isn't it?

                        FERGUS
          Like what?

                        DIL
          Make a pass or something. Isn't that the
          way it goes?

                        FERGUS
          Must be.



                                                              49.



EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

They are walking in an alleyway toward her house.

                        DIL
          You got a special friend, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          How special?

                        DIL
          You want one?

And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights
on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it.

                        FERGUS
          Jesus Christ!

                        DIL
          Jesus.

The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches
off.

                        FERGUS
          That Dave?

                        DIL
          The things a girl has to put up with.

She looks down toward where the car has pulled away.

                        DIL
          I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like
          him.

EXT. DIL'S FLAT.

A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus.

                        DIL
          Piss off, Dave!

                        FERGUS
          Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all
          right on your own?

                        DIL
          I'm not on my own, am I?

She touches his cheek.



                                                             50.



                        DIL
          Come on up, would you?

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil comes in in the darkness. Fergus stands like a shadow in
the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.

                        DIL
          Won't hurt you to come in.

Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an
exaggerated femininity about everything in it.

                        DIL
          Would you like a drink?

                        FERGUS
          Yes, please.

                        DIL
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          Whiskey.

She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the
mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks
into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His
reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's.

She comes through with two drinks.

                        FERGUS
          Someone out there.

                        DIL
          Jesus fucking Christ.

She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in
a neck brace.

                        DIL
          Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --

                        DAVE
          It's Dave.

She goes back into the room and begins taking things up.

                        DAVE
          Talk to me, Dil --



                                                              51.



                        DIL
           Sure, Dave --

                        DAVE
           Please, Dil --

She flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a
suitcase, a teddy bear.

                        DIL
           Take your clothes.

                        DAVE
           Don't throw my clothes out the window!

                        DIL
           Fuck off back to Essex!

                        DAVE
           Fucking mad!

Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of
rejection with his things in his arms.

                        DAVE
           Don't chuck my clothes out!

                        DIL
           Take your fucking goldfish, too!

Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl
breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the
street.

                        DAVE
           You fucking bitch!

He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands.

                        DAVE
           Murderer!

Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut.

                        DIL
           Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a
           brace?

                        FERGUS
           Must be in love to manage that.

                        DIL
           Doesn't know the meaning of the word.



                                                              52.



Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass.

                       FERGUS
          He lived here with you?

                       DIL
          Tried to. Sit down, will you?

Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from
her to the picture.

                       FERGUS
          What about him?

He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink.

                       DIL
          He was different.

                       FERGUS
          How different?

                       DIL
          As different as it's possible to be.

                       FERGUS
          Tell me about him.

                       DIL
          No.

                       FERGUS
          Shouldn't I go?

                       DIL
          Yes.

And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with
her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently
passionate.

They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The
photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress
with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.

                       DIL
          No --

                       FERGUS
          Did you do that to him?

She comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close
to his ear.



                                                              53.



                        DIL
          You want to know how I kissed him?

                        FERGUS
          Yes...

                        DIL
          Are you jealous of him?

                        FERGUS
          Maybe.

                        DIL
          That's good...

She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down
his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her
hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while
her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her
mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of
Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her
head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.

                        FERGUS
          What would he think?

                        DIL
          Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He
          was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

She sits in front of the mirror.

                        FERGUS
          Do you miss him?

                        DIL
          What do you think?

                        FERGUS
          I think you do.

                        DIL
                  (dreamily)
          You say that like a gentleman.

                        FERGUS
          Do I?

                        DIL
          Like you're concerned.

Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair
from her face.



                                                             54.



                        DIL
          But you can t stay, you know that?

                        FERGUS
          Didn't think I could.

                        DIL
          A real gentleman...

She embraces him.

                        FERGUS
          Shouldn't you be in mourning?

                        DIL
          I am.

She sits back down in front of the mirror. Fergus leaves. She
reapplies her lipstick.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Singer in a blue dress. Dil and Fergus by the bar. Both
drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them
with his neck brace.

                        DAVE
          Look, I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                        DAVE
          No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm
          sorry, didn't I?

                        DIL
          Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?

Fergus nods. He stands. Dave steps two feet back.

                        FERGUS
          I was only going to ask her for a dance.

Fergus takes Dil's arm.

                        FERGUS
          Shall we?

The woman is singing.

As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly. Dil
holds her cheek close to his.



                                                             55.



                      FERGUS
          Did he come here too?

                      DIL
          Is this an obsession of yours?

                      FERGUS
          Maybe.

                      DIL
          He did sometimes.

                      FERGUS
          Did he dance with you?

Dil doesn't answer. Looks at him out of the corner of her
eye.

                      DIL
          So what do you want with me, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Want to look after you.

                      DIL
          What does that mean?

                      FERGUS
          Something I heard someone say once.

She draws back and looks at him.

                      DIL
          You mean that?

                      FERGUS
          Yeah.

She dances closer.

                      DIL
          Why?

                      FERGUS
          If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

In the bar, people singing along with the music. Col sings.
Dave sitting at the bar, sulking.

                      DIL
          You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause
          Dil can't stand that.



                                                             56.



                     FERGUS
          No.

She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his
drink down.

                     DIL
          And she does get very upset...

Dave stands up to leave. On the stage the act finishes. Dil
draws Fergus back to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Col, the barman, pours her drink.

                     DIL
          One for him, too.

Col pours and smiles.

                     DIL
          Drink.

                     FERGUS
          What is this?

                     DIL
          I'm superstitious. Drink.

He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one.

                     DIL
          Can't leave me now.

                     FERGUS
          Aha.

                     DIL
          The thing is, can you go the distance?

                     FERGUS
          Depends what it is.

                     DIL
          No, depends on nothing.

She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She
slams it back. He sips.

                     DIL
          In one.



                                                              57.



She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket
whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the
photographs.

                           DIL
              What you thinking of, hon?

                           FERGUS
              I'm thinking of your man.

                           DIL
              Why?

                           FERGUS
              I'm wondering why you keep his things.

                           DIL
              Told you, I'm superstitious.

She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her
shoulders.

                           FERGUS
              Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?

                           DIL
              All the time.

Fergus runs his hand down her throat.

                           DIL
              Even now.

                           FERGUS
              No...

                           DIL
              He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.

She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him
down. They kiss passionately.

                           DIL
              Give me one minute.

She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at
the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She
comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks
extraordinarily beautiful.



                                                              58.


He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward
him. He begins to kiss her face and neck.

                            FERGUS
              Would he have minded?

She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her
shoulders.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness.
Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently,
with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a
close-up, that she is a man.

Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.

                            DIL
              You did know, didn't you?

Fergus says nothing.

                            DIL
              Oh my God.

She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch
him. Fergus smacks the hand away.

                            FERGUS
              Jesus. I feel sick --

He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet.

                            DIL
              Don't go, Jimmy --

He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into
the tub.

She crouches on the floor.

                            DIL
              I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

He retches again.

                            DIL
              What were you doing in the bar if you
              didn't know -- I'm bleeding...

She lights a cigarette.

Fergus runs the taps. He washes his face, rinses his mouth.



                                                              59.



                        DIL
          It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.
          Just not on the face.

Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the
kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A
trace of blood on her mouth.

                        DIL
          Y'see, I'm not a young thing any
          longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't
          you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you
          expected.

Fergus comes out of the bathroom.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

She looks up. Some hope in her face.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him.

                        DIL
          Don't go like that. Say something...

He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor.

                        DIL
          Jesus.

He drags himself away and runs down the stairs.

INT. FERGUS'S FLAT

Fergus in bed. Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in
cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

The place is hopping. Fergus enters. He now sees it as he
should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar.
He makes his way through the crowds. All the women too-
heavily made-up. Some beautifully sleek young things he looks
at he realizes are young men. He makes his way to the bar
where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it.
Her face is bruised. She is wearing dark glasses.

As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. She talks
to Col the barman.



                                                          60.



                          DIL
            He's back, Col

                          COL
            Hi.

                          DIL
            Don't want any of those looks, Col. They
            don't mean much.

                          COL
            Stop it, Dil --

                          DIL
            No. Tell him to go fuck himself.

Fergus sits. Col turns to him.

                          COL
            She wants me to tell you go fuck
            yourself.

                          FERGUS
            I'm sorry.

There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark
glasses.

                          DIL
            Tell him to stop messing Dil around --

                          FERGUS
            Dil --

                          DIL
            Tell him it hurt --

                          FERGUS
            I have to talk to her, Col --

                          COL
            Says he's got to talk to you --

Fergus touches her arm.

                          FERGUS
            Come on, Dil --

                          DIL
            Where?

She whips her arm away.



                                                              61.



                        DIL
          Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --

She walks into the crowd, toward the door.

Fergus leaves.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room
are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,
pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We
hear the song "The Crying Game."

Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and
sticks it in the letter box.

EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY

A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with
a pole and replaces it with a number nine.

Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn
toward the building where Fergus is working.

INT. SITE - DAY

Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the
pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving
glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch
basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high
heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks
out.

Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving
toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.
As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,
which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a
ladder toward Fergus .

                        DEVEROUX
          How much did that frame cost, Mr.
          Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.



                                                              62.



                        DEVEROUX
          Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,
          will it, Mr. Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Not in my experience.

                        DEVEROUX
          Off his wages.

                        FERGUS
          Do you mean that?

                        DEVEROUX
          He wants to know do I mean that.

                        FRANKNUM
          I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Bloody right I do...

Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf
whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window
should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at
her, looking up her skirt, etc.

She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?

                        FERGUS
          She's not a tart.

                        DEVEROUX
          No, of course not, she's a lady.

                        FERGUS
          She's not that either.

Fergus walks out of the room.

Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves,
sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.

                        DIL
          Darling --

She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is
wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She
pecks him on the cheek.



                                                       63.



                      DIL
          Never let the sun go down on an argument,
          Jody used to say.

                      FERGUS
          What you doing here?

                      DIL
          Got your note. So let's kiss and make up,
          hon.

                      FERGUS
          Don't call me that.

                      DIL
          Sorry, darling.

                      FERGUS
          Give it over, Dil --

                      DIL
          Apologies, my sweet.

Fergus smiles in spite of himself.

                      DIL
          That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.

She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.

                      FERGUS
          You're something else, Dil, you know
          that?

                      DIL
          Never said a truer word.

She hands him a neatly cut sandwich.

                      DIL
          See, I was always best looking after
          someone. Must be something in the genes.

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

                      DIL
          And the fact that you didn't know is
          basically the fault of yours truly. And
          even when you were throwing up, I could
          tell you cared.



                                                       64.



                        FERGUS
          You could?

                        DIL
          Do you care, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Sure I do.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

                        FERGUS
          Yeah. I care, Dil.

She lowers her head.

                        FERGUS
          You crying, Dil?

He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.

                        DIL
          I'm tired and emotional.

Then he hears a voice behind him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Do it on your own time, Paddy.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DEVEROUX
          Whatever it is she does for you.

Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.

                        FERGUS
          If I was her I'd consider that an insult.

                        DEVEROUX
          Consider it how you like. Just get that
          bloody tart out of here.

Fergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.

                        FERGUS
          Did you ever pick your teeth up with
          broken fingers?

Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.



                                                          65.



                      DEVEROUX
          What's that supposed to mean?

                      FERGUS
          It's a simple question.

Deveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.

                      FERGUS
          Come on, dear.

He holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it.
Her face is wreathed in a smile.

                      DIL
          He didn't answer, honey --

Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.

                      FRANKNUM
          Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.

                      DIL
          My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.

                      FERGUS
          Shut up.

                      DIL
          Made me feel all funny inside.

                      FERGUS
          I said stop it.

                      DIL
          Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.

                      FERGUS
          You think that's wise?

                      DIL
          Nothing's wise.

The lift stops with a thud.

                      FERGUS
          I didn't mean to hit you.

                      DIL
          I know that.



                                                            66.



                        FERGUS
          Kind of liked you as a girl.

                        DIL
          That's a start.

                        FERGUS
          So I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Make it up to me, then.

                        FERGUS
          How?

                        DIL
          Ask to meet me again.

                        FERGUS
          Will you meet me again?

                        DIL
          When?

                        FERGUS
          Whenever. Tonight.

She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of
catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him
back up to the site.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off
her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling.
Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.

                        FERGUS
          Do they know?

                        DIL
          Know what, honey?

                        FERGUS
          Know what I didn't know. And don't call
          me that.

                        DIL
          Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her
          feelings.

                        FERGUS
          Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.



                                                          67.



                       DIL
          Details, baby, details.

                       FERGUS
          So they do know.

                       DIL
          All right, they do.

She takes his arm as they walk off.

                       FERGUS
          Don't.

                       DIL
          Sorry.

                       FERGUS
          I should have known, shouldn't I?

                       DIL
          Probably.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of wish I didn't.

                       DIL
          You can always pretend.

                       FERGUS
          That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't
          he?

                       DIL
          Absolutely.

                       FERGUS
          Won't be quite the same though, will it?

                       DIL
          Are you pretending yet?

                       FERGUS
          I'm working on it.

Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look.

                       FERGUS
          There's Dave. He knew too.

                       DIL
          Stop it, Jimmy.



                                                          68.



                        FERGUS
          Am I becoming repetitious?

                        DIL
          A little.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.

They reach her door. The car stops.

                        FERGUS
          Don't ask me in.

                        DIL
          Please, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          No. Can't pretend that much.

                        DIL
          I miss you, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          Should have stayed a girl.

                        DIL
          Don't be cruel.

                        FERGUS
          Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.

                        DIL
          Only if you kiss me.

Fergus kisses her. He looks at her open lips as if in
disbelief at himself.

                        FERGUS
          Happy now?

                        DIL
          Delirious.

She goes inside.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light.
Then he hears a voice.

                        JUDE
          Hello, stranger.



                                                            69.



He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark
brown.

                        JUDE
          You vanished.

He stares at her, says nothing.

                        JUDE
          What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the
          gaff on us or did you just fuck up?

                        FERGUS
          Leave me alone, Jude.

                        JUDE
          No. That's the last thing I'll do. You
          never asked what happened.

                        FERGUS
          I heard.

                        JUDE
          Eddie and Tinker died.

                        FERGUS
          I know.

                        JUDE
          Maguire and me got out by the skin of our
          teeth. No thanks to you.... What you
          think of the hair?

                        FERGUS
          Suits you.

She walks round the room.

                        JUDE
          Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a
          tougher look, if you know what I mean.

She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black
leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.

                        JUDE
          Fuck me, Fergus.

He takes her hand away.

                        JUDE
          Am I to take it that's a no?



                                                       70.



He says nothing.

                     JUDE
          We had a court-martial in your absence.
          They wanted to put a bullet in your head.
          I pleaded for clemency. Said we should
          find out what happened first. So what did
          happen?

                     FERGUS
          He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.
          I tried to catch him. He made it to the
          road and got hit by a Saracen.

                     JUDE
          So you did fuck up.

                     FERGUS
          Yes.

                     JUDE
          But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          No, what is the thing?

                     JUDE
          You vanished quite effectively. Became
          Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how
          useful that could be.

                     FERGUS
          What do you mean?

                     JUDE
          We've got some plans here. And we'll need
          a Mister Nobody to execute them.

                     FERGUS
          No way, Jude. I'm out.

                     JUDE
          You're never out, Fergus.

She looks at him hard. He looks away.

                     JUDE
          Maybe you don't care whether you die or
          not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The
          wee black chick.

He leaps up from the bed.



                                                          71.



                    FERGUS
          Leave her out of this.

                    JUDE
          Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.
          You know we won't leave her out of this.
          But I'm glad to see you care.

She brings her lips close to his so they touch.

                    JUDE
          And I must admit I'm curious.

He grabs her hair and pulls her head back.

                    FERGUS
          What the fuck do you know, Jude?

She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.

                    JUDE
          You fucking tell me, boy --

Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly:

                    FERGUS
          She's nobody. She likes me.

                    JUDE
          So I suppose a fuck is out of the
          question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No
          sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.
          You'll be hearing from us.

She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.

                    JUDE
          Keep the faith.

She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand.

He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then
the chair turns and we see it is Jude.

Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling
brightly, then talking back to Dil



                                                          72.



INT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

                        JUDE
          He your boyfriend?

Jude, turning in the chair.

                        JUDE
          Lucky you.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

                        DIL
          Carnations.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DIL
          He'd bring me carnations.

                        FERGUS
          So I got it wrong, then.

                        DIL
          Not at all, honey.

                        FERGUS
          Don't.

                        DIL
          Okay.

She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and
sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly.

He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-
marches her out.

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          Why, honey --

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          You gonna tell me why?

                        FERGUS
          No.



                                                              73.



As they pass Jude, she smiles.

EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away.

                       DIL
          What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong
          --

                       FERGUS
          Not here.

They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar.

                       DIL
          You gonna tell me what it is?

A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude.

                       JUDE
          What was it?

                       DIL
          You know her, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?

                       FERGUS
          Dil, this is Jude.

                       DIL
          You following me?

                       JUDE
          Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to
          you, Dil?

                       DIL
          Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as
          they say.

                       DIL
          Absolutely. The younger the better.
          Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.



                                                    74.



                      JUDE
          Don't go looking for it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.

                      JUDE
          A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she,
          Jimmy?

                      DIL
          A girl has to have a bit of glamour.

                      JUDE
          Absolutely. Long as she can keep it.
          Isn't that right, James...

She leaves. Dil watches her go.

                      DIL
          It's her, isn't it?

                      FERGUS
          What's her?

                      DIL
          She's the thing you had to tell me.

                      FERGUS
          Kind of.

                      DIL
          I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really
          sorry.

She looks at Col

                      DIL
          You see that, Col?

                      COL
          Saw it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fuck it, is what I say.

                      COL
          Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fucking men, Col --



                                                              75.



                       COL
          Fuck 'em.

There are tears in her eyes. She stands.

                       DIL
          And fuck you, Jimmy --

She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an
expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very
small.

                       COL
          You could always make it up to her.

                       FERGUS
          How?

                       COL
          When a girl runs out like that, she
          generally wants to be followed.

                       FERGUS
          She's not a girl, Col --

                       COL
          Whatever you say.

But Fergus rises and walks out.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

A figure standing down the alleyway, smoking. Fergus looks
toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting.

                       JUDE
          She went that way --

Jude grabs his arm.

                       JUDE
          But you come with me.

She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting.
They get inside.

ANOTHER CAR - BY THE PUB.

Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting
in the car.



                                                            76.



INT. CAR - NIGHT.

In the moving car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her.
Fergus sits in the back.

                     FERGUS
          So it was you all the time.

                     MAGUIRE
          Who'd you think it was?

                     FERGUS
          I thought it was Dave.

                     MAGUIRE
          And who's Dave when he's at home?

                     FERGUS
          He's at home.

                     MAGUIRE
          Should blow you away, you know that?

                     FERGUS
          I know that.

Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks
him on the teeth with his closed fist.

                     MAGUIRE
          I'm getting emotional. And I don't want
          to get fucking emotional -- you
          understand, Hennessy?

                     FERGUS
          I understand.

                     MAGUIRE
          Fuck you, too --

Jude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the
street outside.

                     JUDE
          Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.

                     MAGUIRE
          That true, Fergus? You in love?

                     FERGUS
          Absolutely.



                                                             77.



                           MAGUIRE
             And what's she like between the sheets?

                           FERGUS
             Definitely unusual.

                           MAGUIRE
             And who is she?

                           FERGUS
             Just a girl.

                           MAGUIRE
             And you know what'll happen if you fuck
             up again, don't you?

                           FERGUS
             Aye, I do, Peter.

                           MAGUIRE
             Good.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

The car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors
down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative
club.

In the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the
building.

                           MAGUIRE
             So what do you think that is, Hennessy?

                           FERGUS
             A hotel?

                           MAGUIRE
             It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh?
             He visits his ladies on Tuesday and
             Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.
             His security's in the car beyond.

He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away.
Fergus looks from the window to the car.

                           FERGUS
             Who is he?

                           MAGUIRE
             Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we
             would call a legitimate target.



                                                          78.



                       FERGUS
          Thank God for that.

                       MAGUIRE
          You being cynical, Hennessy?

                       FERGUS
          Hope not.

                       MAGUIRE
          Good. So what do you think?

                       FERGUS
          Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men
          are any good. And I presume you can't get
          in.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          So it's on the street.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of suicide, isn't it?

Jude turns around to look at him.

                       FERGUS
          But, then, I don't have a choice.

                       JUDE
          Och, you do, Fergie.

                       FERGUS
          Of course. I forgot.

                       JUDE
          Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.

Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the
street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-
bar with some tables outside.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

Fergus and Jude, crossing the street.

                       JUDE
          You keep your mind on the job, boy --



                                                              79.



                    FERGUS
          And then you'll leave her out of it?

                    JUDE
          Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

They take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel
down the way.

                    JUDE
          He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to
          get to the door.

She checks her watch. Fergus is sweating.

                    FERGUS
          And what if I say no?

                    JUDE
          You know what. Go.

Down by the brothel, the door swings open.

Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel.
There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it.
The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens.

Fergus quickens his pace.

Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking.

The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the
pavement, through the passersby, toward the car.

A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward
the old gent.

Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes
between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes
Fergus's elbow.

                    GENT
          Pardon me, young man --

Fergus walks on.

Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old
man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler.
Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off.

When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks
back.



                                                           80.



Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.

                       JUDE
          You were made for this.

                       FERGUS
          Was I?

                       JUDE
          Perfect.

                       FERGUS
          And what happens then?

                       JUDE
          We'll be on the other side. We'll move
          when you do.

                       FERGUS
          And what if you don't?

                       JUDE
          Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

                       FERGUS
          You may be right.

                       JUDE
          Stay late at your work tomorrow night and
          I'll bring you the gear.

Jude begins to walk away.

                       FERGUS
          Jude?

                       JUDE
          Yes?

                       FERGUS
          Who's the old geezer?

                       JUDE
          Some judge...

She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car.
Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes
inside; he follows.

                       FERGUS
          Why'd you follow me, Dil?



                                                              81.



                      DIL
          Was jealous, Jimmy.

She downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high.

                      FERGUS
          Shouldn't be, Dil

                      DIL
          Why shouldn't I be jealous?

There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand
and begins to wipe her face.

                      DIL
          Don't. My makeup.

She sits down; he joins her.

                      DIL
          She own you, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Yes.

                      DIL
          She from Scotland too?

                      FERGUS
          You could say that.

                      DIL
          And you're not going to tell me more?

                      FERGUS
          I can't.

He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the
tissue in her drink and wipes some more.

                      DIL
          What you doing, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          I'm not sure.

                      DIL
          Do you like me even a little bit?

                      FERGUS
          More than that.

Dil's face, staring at him.



                                                            82.



                           FERGUS
             Come on, let's go for a walk.

She allows herself to be led out.

EXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window.

                           FERGUS
             You do something for me, Dil?

                           DIL
             Anything.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

                           DIL
             Afraid so.

                           FERGUS
             You got the keys to the shop?

They walk inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness.

                           DIL
             You want another haircut, baby?

                           FERGUS
             No. Sit down.

He sits her down in one of the chairs.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

Dil nods.

                           DIL
             Anything.

Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head
leaps back.

                           DIL
             No way --



                                                             83.



                        FERGUS
          You said anything, Dil

                        DIL
          A girl has to draw the line somewhere --

                        FERGUS
          Want to change you to a man, Dil...

She stares at him.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          It's a secret.

                        DIL
          You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          And you wouldn't leave me?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

She takes a breath.

                        DIL
          Go on, then.

Fergus begins to cut.

CLOSE-UP ON DlL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream
down her cheeks.

                        DIL
          You're no good at this, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

But he keeps cutting. He gives Dil a short, cropped military
cut like Jody's.



                                                              84.



                    DIL
          You want to make me look like him...

                    FERGUS
          No. Want to make you into something new.
          That nobody recognizes...

She looks in the mirror at it in the dark.

                    DIL
          Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the
light. He stops her hand.

                    FERGUS
          No.

She looks at her hand on his.

                    FERGUS
          Better in the dark.

Her fingers close around his.

                    DIL
          So it's true, then?

                    FERGUS
          What?

                    DIL
          You like me better like this.

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His
hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons.

                    DIL
          Oh, Jimmy --

Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. She
falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.

                    FERGUS
          No. No. Dil... get up...

He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She
stretches languorously down on it.



                                                              85.


He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. She turns on
the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing
suspender-belts underneath her skirt.

                        DIL
          Baby...

But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe
where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns.

                        DIL
          What are you doing, honey...

We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with
Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --

                        DIL
          Sorry. What you doing?

Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.

                        FERGUS
          Try this on, Dil

He wraps the shirt around her.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          For me.

                        DIL
          For you...

She kisses him.

EXT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down
the street and inside.

                        DIL
          Why are we going here, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Look on it like a honeymoon.



                                                              86.



INT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on
a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts
out the cigarette.

Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes.
Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on
his coat, and walks out.

EXT. SITE - EVENING.

A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel
in her hand.

INT. SITE - EVENING.

Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude.

                        JUDE
          You a handyman, Fergie?

                        FERGUS
          I take pride in my work.

                        JUDE
          I sincerely hope so.

Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something
from the bag.

                        JUDE
          Tools of the trade.

She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly.

                        JUDE
          And forget about the girl.

Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There
is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.

INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls.

                        FERGUS
          Dil?

No reply. He runs outside.



                                                              87.



EXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in
her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil
walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her.

                        FERGUS
          Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing
          here?

                        DIL
          I'm going home!

                        FERGUS
          Told you to stay in the hotel!

                        DIL
          Thought you was fooling me. Thought you
          was leaving me.

They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very
drunk.

                        FERGUS
          I had to go to work!

                        DIL
          Stayed all day in that room thinking
          every noise was you. There's something
          you're not telling me, Jimmy.

He takes her arm.

                        FERGUS
          Come on...

                        DIL
          No! I'm going home...

Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat.

                        DIL
          So tell me.

                        FERGUS
          I was trying to get out of something.

                        DIL
          No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.

Fergus looks at her.



                                                             88.



                       FERGUS
             You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.

                       DIL
             You mean that?

                       FERGUS
             Yes.

And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue.

                       FERGUS
             Stop it, would you?

There is no response. He shakes her.

                       FERGUS
             Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --

Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She
opens her eyes slowly.

                       DIL
             Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood
             condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy,
             then I'll be all right.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then
goes to the window to check the street outside.

She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey.

                       FERGUS
             You heard what I said, Dil?

                       DIL
             My pills...

She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the
bathroom.

                       FERGUS
             What pills?

                       DIL
             Prescription. For my condition.

                       FERGUS
             What condition?



                                                             89.



                         DIL
           My condition. Ennui.

He goes and gets the pills.

She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey
bottle.

                         FERGUS
           Are you supposed to take that many?

                         DIL
           Only in times of extreme stress.

She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down.

                         DIL
           See, they all say good-bye sometime.
           'Cept for him.

She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus.

                         FERGUS
           Are you all right, Dil?

                         DIL
           I will be.

She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands
between her knees.

                         DIL
           Go on, then.

Fergus walks slowly toward the door.

                         FERGUS
           Good-bye, Dil

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         FERGUS
           What?

                         DIL
           Don't go like that.

She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly
attractive about her.

                         DIL
           Can't help what I am.



                                                              90.



He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips.

We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus
looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic
haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his.

                       DIL
          Knew you had a heart...

Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it.

                       FERGUS
          Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your
          man.

                       DIL
          You knew which man?

                       FERGUS
          Your soldier.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred,
her eyes far away.

                       FERGUS
          Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast.
          Held him hostage for three days.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

                       FERGUS
          Are you listening?

Dil smiles woozily.

                       DIL
          Yes.

                       FERGUS
          I got the order to shoot him. Before I
          could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and
          died.

                       DIL
          Died...

                       FERGUS
          Did you hear me?



                                                             91.



                        DIL
          You killed my Jody?

                        FERGUS
          In a manner of speaking.

                        DIL
          It was you...

She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere.

                        FERGUS
          You should scream. You should beat my
          head off.

She woozily tries to hit him round the face.

                        DIL
          You killed my Jody

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You didn't.

                        FERGUS
          I suppose I tried.

                        DIL
          You tried.

                        FERGUS
          Don't you want to kill me?

Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him.

                        DIL
          Bang...

He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily

                        DIL
          Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me,
          too.

                        FERGUS
          Okay.

Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks
down at her, almost fondly.



                                                             92.



INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes.
She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a
chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the
gun.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties
them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties
them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to
wake him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties
that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is
drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking
so it is secure.

                       FERGUS
             What the fuck --

Dil speaks unnaturally quietly.

                       DIL
             So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and
slips it in her handbag.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand.

                       DIL
             Didn't really listen last night. I heard
             but I didn't listen.

Fergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings.



                                                              93.



                     DIL
          That won't do you no good. Dil knows how
          to tie a body.

She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus.

                     DIL
          Wondered why you came on to me like that
          when you gave me the look.

                     FERGUS
          He asked me to see were you all right.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jude on the street. Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she
gets inside.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

                     DIL
          See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me.
          Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

                     FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                     DIL
          Just don't kick Dil and she'll be
          touched. Be nice to her and she'll be
          yours forever.

She looks at him, tears in her eyes.

                     DIL
          See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I
          can't do that. Yet.

                     FERGUS
          Let me go, Dil

He drags at his bindings.

                     DIL
          Why?

                     FERGUS
          Got to be somewhere.

                     DIL
          Try and go, then.



                                                              94.



EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

The figure of the judge in the window. Outline of a woman.
Jude and Maguire are in the car, parked across the street.
They look toward a paper seller.

                       MAGUIRE
          Where the fuck is he? Christ --

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings.

                       FERGUS
          Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or
          they'll be here

                       DIL
          Let them come then.

IN THE CAR. OUTSIDE BROTHEL.

                       JUDE
          Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around
          once more --

He drives off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus collapsed back on the bed, exhausted.

                       DIL
          Just want your company for a little while
          longer...

EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

Maguire's car driving round once more. No sign of Fergus.

                       MAGUIRE
          That fucker's dead --

                       JUDE
          No, we are.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus strains and roars from the bed.

                       FERGUS
          You don't know what you're doing, Dil --



                                                              95.



                        DIL
          Never did...

MAGUIRE'S POINT OF VIEW -- the brothel door opening. The
elderly judge comes out. The car with his security men guns
up.

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the shooter, Jude --

                        JUDE
          You're crazy --

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the fucking shooter!

He grabs it from her pocket. Throws open the door and runs
across the street. Jude dives into the driver's seat.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus, pulling at his bindings.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROTHEL.

The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open
by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The
goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three
times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls
an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other
goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the
pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - DAY

Dil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like
a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck --
"The Crying Game" song. She comes to the bed, and points the
gun at Fergus's head.

                        DIL
          You like me now, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          I like you, Dil --

                        DIL
          Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.

                        FERGUS
          More what?



                                                           96.



                       DIL
          More endearments.

                       FERGUS
          I like you, DIl

                       DIL
          Love me.

                       FERGUS
          Yes.

                       DIL
          Tell me you love me.

                       FERGUS
          Whatever you say, Dil.

                       DIL
          Then say it.

                       FERGUS
          Love you, Dil.

                       DIL
          You do?

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

                       DIL
          What would you do for me?

                       FERGUS
          Anything.

She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest.

                       DIL
          Say it again.

                       FERGUS
          I'd do anything for you, Dil.

She pulls on his bindings to release him.

EXT. STREET.

Two police cars, sirens wailing.



                                                              97.



INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound
his hands are nearly undone.

                        DIL
          And you'll never leave me?

                        FERGUS
          Never.

                        DIL
          I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice
          to hear it.

His arm is free. He strokes her hair.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry, Dil.

She shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the
background.

Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a
gun.

                        JUDE
          You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough.
          But twice.

Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude.

                        DIL
          You didn't knock, honey --

Dil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the
floor.

                        FERGUS
          Dil!

                        JUDE
          Get that thing off me, Fergus --

Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude.

                        DIL
          What was that she called you, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.



                                                             98.



                    DIL
          What's Fergus?

                    FERGUS
          It's my name, Dil --

                    DIL
          What happened to Jimmy?

                    JUDE
          I said get it off me, Fergus --

Jude, on the floor, reaches for her gun. Manages to grab it.

                    DIL
          What's she going to do, Jimmy? She going
          to blow you away?

Dil shoots again, like a child, playing with a toy. She hits
Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, the gun the
other.

                    DIL
          Was she there too? When you got my Jody?

Fergus screams


                    FERGUS
          Dil!!!

                    DIL
          I asked you a question, honey -- were you
          there too --

                    JUDE
          You sick bitch --

As she raises the gun, Dil shoots her repeatedly, saying:

                    DIL
          You was there, wasn't you? You used those
          tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?

Fergus screams from the bed. He rips free his other arm. Dil
shoots Jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in
blood. Dil turns the gun on Fergus.

                    DIL
          She was there, wasn't she?



                                                          99.



                        FERGUS
          She was --

                        DIL
          And she used her tits and that cute
          little ass to get him, didn't she?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          Tell me what she wore.

                        FERGUS
          Can't remember...

Dil points the gun at him, squeezing on the trigger. Then she
stops.

                        DIL
          Can't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.

She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front
of it.

                        DIL
          You won't let me, Jody --

She raises the gun and places it in her mouth. Fergus takes
it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. He lifts
her up by the shoulders.

                        FERGUS
          You've got to go now, Dil --

                        DIL
          Do I?

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Now.

                        DIL
          Am I in trouble, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Not if you go.

                        DIL
          Will I see you again?

                        FERGUS
          You will, Dil



                                                             100.



                        DIL
          Promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

                        DIL
          Where am I to go, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          The Metro.

                        DIL
          Meet Col --

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Say hello to Col --

He leads her out the door. Fergus goes back into the room,
past Jude's body. Looks out the window to where he can see
Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have
gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches
Dil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees
the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the
house. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove
Dil's fingerprints. He turns to the picture of the soldier;
talks to it.

                        FERGUS
          You should have stayed at home.

He sits in the chair by the window, waiting.

                                                FADE TO BLACK.

INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

FADE UP to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in
the windows. Large barred doors open and a group of women
come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc. Among them
is Dil, looking resplendent. She walks past the rows of
convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where
Fergus sits, waiting.

                        DIL
          Got you the multivitamins and the iron
          tablets, hon --

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --



                                                        101.



                        DIL
          Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are
          magnesium supplement --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                        DIL
          I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm
          counting the days. Two thousand three
          hundred and thirty-four left.

                        FERGUS
          Thirty-five.

                        DIL
          I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the
          leap year. What am I supposed to call you
          then, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.

                        DIL
          Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life -
          -

                        FERGUS
          Please, Dil --

                        DIL
          Can't help it. You're doing time for me.
          No greater love, as the man says. Wish
          you'd tell me why.

                        FERGUS
          As the man said, it's in my nature.

                        DIL
          What's that supposed to mean?

She shakes her head.

                        FERGUS
          Well, there was this scorpion, you see.
          And he wants to go across the river. But
          he can't swim. So he goes to this frog,
          who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse
          me, Mr. Froggy..."



                                                           102.



CAMERA PULLS BACK, and as Fergus tells the story of the
scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your
Man."

                                                    FADE OUT.
The Crying Game


FADE IN:

EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

A loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a
Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris
Wheel turning round and round.

A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with
blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings
around a bowling pin.

                       JODY
            And that's cricket, hon.

An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in
his huge hands. He gives it to the girl.

                       JODY
            You want it?

                       GIRL
            Sure.

                       JODY
            Doesn't matter if you don't.

He puts his arm around her and drags her on.

                       JODY
            Jody won't be offended. Jody's never
            offended. What'd you say your name was?

                       GIRL
            Jude.

                       JODY
            Jude. Suits you, Jude.

                       JUDE
            The teddy bear?

                       JODY
            No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And
            it's June. Jude in June.

He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.



                                                               2.



                        JODY
          Gotta piss, Jude.

He holds her hand.

                        JODY
          Don't run off, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You don't know me, do you?

Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We
can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the
canvas, looking bored.

                        JODY
              (inside)
          What if I did?

                        JUDE
          You'd know I wouldn't run off.

She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her
eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-
haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.

                        JODY
          Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.

                        JUDE
          You didn't?

                        JODY
          And you know what?

                        JUDE
          Tell me, Jody

He staggers out, buttoning up.

                        JODY
          It's nice.

He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.

                        JUDE
          Not here.

                        JODY
          Who gives a fuck.

                        JUDE
          You never know.



                                                               3.



She pulls him over toward the water.

                       JODY
             I never know nothing.

                       JUDE
             People. They could be looking.

Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He
moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach,
under a train trestle.

                       JUDE
             Come and get me, soldier --

                       JODY
             Whatever you say, Jude...

He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms
around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,
fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow
falls across them.

CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He
turns around, drunkenly.

                       JODY
             What the fuck --

The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.

Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a
field.

Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing
among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around
him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.

INT. CAR - DAY

A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,
three in the back.

On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet
on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a
gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is
smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat
innocent.

                       FERGUS
             So what's your name, soldier?



                                                               4.



                       JODY
          Fuck you.

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - EVENING.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small
lean man, talks to him through the hood.

                       MAGUIRE
          The situation is simple. You're being
          held hostage by the Irish Republican
          Army. They've got one of our senior
          members under interrogation in
          Castleraigh. We've informed them that if
          they don't release him within three days,
          you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our
          guest until further developments. Have
          you anything to say?

Jody is motionless under the black hood.

                       FERGUS
          Give him a cup of tea.

                       MAGUIRE
          Do you want a cup of tea?

He still says nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a
plate and some food on it.

                       FERGUS
          See does he want some.

                       JUDE
          Do you want some food?

Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.

                                                       DISSOLVE.

Late at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is
sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.
Jude comes in, with a flashlight.



                                                               5.



                    FERGUS
          Hey -- what's he like?

                    JUDE
          Horny bastard.

                    FERGUS
          Did you give him it?

                    JUDE
          There are certain things I wouldn't do
          for my country.

                    FERGUS
          Have a look at him.

                    JUDE
          Can't.

                    FERGUS
          Poke him or something. See if he's still
          alive.

                    JUDE
          He's all right.

                    FERGUS
          Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.
          Have a heart.

She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her
foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so
slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like
lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,
throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.

                    JODY
          You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --

He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He
writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is
screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing
guns, screaming.

                    MAGUIRE
          Turn the fucking thing off --

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.

                    FERGUS
          You all right?



                                                               6.



                        JUDE
          Fucking animal.

She takes in huge gobs of air.

                        FERGUS
          You don't know that.

                        JUDE
          Fucking do. I had him all over me.

He touches her face.

                        FERGUS
          Tough work, that.

                        JUDE
          Someone's got to do it.

She rubs her hand on his chest.

                        JUDE
          Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of
          you.

She sidles closer, coming on to him.

                        JUDE
          And you know what, Fergus? One of you
          made me want it...

She puts her lips to his neck.

                        FERGUS
          Which one?

She doesn't answer. They embrace.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING.

A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the
house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward
a greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The
sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron
chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap.
Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He
holds one out toward him.



                                                               7.



                     FERGUS
           Eat something, would you?

                     JODY
           Can't.

                     FERGUS
           What do you mean you can't?

                     JODY
           Can't eat through a canvas bag.

Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is
revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats,
slowly.

                     JODY
           This is a farce, man.

                     FERGUS
           How is it a farce?

                     JODY
           I seen your fucking face.

                     FERGUS
           So, what do I look like?

                     JODY
           You're the one about five ten with the
           killer smile and the baby face.

                     FERGUS
           Am I?

                     JODY
           Yeah. And the brown eyes.

Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's
mouth.

                     JODY
           You're the handsome one.

Jody eats the last bits.

                     JODY
           Thank you, handsome.

                     FERGUS
           My pleasure.



                                                               8.



EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She
is carrying a pot of tea and two cups.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

It is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S
COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat.

                        JODY
          I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a
          Christian, will you?

Jude comes into view.

                        JODY
          Tell him to take the hood off, honey...

Jude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground.

                        FERGUS
          How did you know it was her?

                        JODY
          I can smell her perfume.

Jude pours out the tea.

                        JUDE
          See, if we took the hood off, we'd have
          to shoot you. As it is, you've got a
          fifty-fifty chance.

                        JODY
          Thought you liked me, bitch.

                        JUDE
          It was fun while it lasted.

                        JODY
          Nice lady.

His breathing becomes labored.

                        JODY
          Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.

                        FERGUS
          Can't we take it off?

                        JUDE
          Have to check with himself.



                                                             9.



Fergus gives her the gun.

                        FERGUS
          You look after him.

Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves.

                        JODY
          Don't leave me with her, man. She's
          dangerous...

Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters. Maguire and the others. Maguire has a
newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping.

                        MAGUIRE
          Made the front page. They'll move now,
          the fuckers.

                        FERGUS
          Request permission to take the hood off,
          Tommy.

                        MAGUIRE
          Why would you do that?

                        FERGUS
          The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

                        MAGUIRE
          So?

                        FERGUS
          And anyway, he's seen our faces.

                        MAGUIRE
          You sure?

                        FERGUS
          He described me down to a T. Knows what
          Jude looks like.

Maguire reads the paper.

                        FERGUS
          Tommy --



                                                            10.



                     MAGUIRE
          You're his keeper. If you don't mind him
          seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the
          only one he looks at.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

                     MAGUIRE
          It's your decision.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters.
He puts his arm casually around her.

                     FERGUS
          Leave us, Judie.

                     JUDE
          My pleasure.

She goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off.
Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes
in mighty gulps of air. He smiles.

                     JODY
          Thank you, soldier.

Fergus smiles.

                     JODY
          Never thought fresh air would taste this
          good.

Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips.

                     JODY
          Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be
          able to feed myself.

                     FERGUS
          No fucking way.

                     JODY
          Only joking.

Fergus drinks.

                     JODY
          You know, I was wrong about one thing.



                                                              11.



                          FERGUS
            What's that?

                          JODY
            Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no
            pinup.

                          FERGUS
            No?

                          JODY
            Nope. Not handsome at all.

                          FERGUS
            You trying to hurt my feelings?

                          JODY
            No. It's the truth.

                          FERGUS
            Well, I could say the same about you.

                          JODY
            Could you?

                          FERGUS
            But I won't. We're more polite around
            these parts.

                          JODY
            So I've noticed.

Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes
back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on
his lap.

                          JODY
            Hey --

                          FERGUS
            What is it now?

                          JODY
            You're going to have to do it, aren't
            you?

                          FERGUS
            Do what?

                          JODY
            Kill me.



                                            12.



           FERGUS
What makes you think that?

           JODY
They're going to let that guy die. And
you're going to kill me.

           FERGUS
They won't let him die.

           JODY
You want to bet?

           FERGUS
I'm not a gambling man.

           JODY
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't
just let me loose.

           FERGUS
Why can't we?

           JODY
Not in your nature.

           FERGUS
What do you know about my nature?

           JODY
I'm talking about your people, not you.

           FERGUS
What the fuck do you know about my
people?

           JODY
Only that you're all tough undeluded
motherfuckers. And that it's not in your
nature to let me go.

           FERGUS
Shut the fuck up, would you?

           JODY
And you know the funny thing?

           FERGUS
No, what's the funny thing?

           JODY
I didn't even fancy her.



                                                             13.



                       FERGUS
          Didn't look like that to me...

                       JODY
          She's not my type.

He looks at Fergus.

                       JODY
          C'mere.

                       FERGUS
          No.

                       JODY
          Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.

                       FERGUS
          What?

                       JODY
          My inside pocket.

Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's
inside pocket.

                       JODY
          Take out the wallet.

Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet.

                       JODY
          Open it.

CLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification
photograph.

                       JODY
          Inside. There's a picture.

Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites,
smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles.

                       JODY
          No, not that one. There's another.

Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful
black woman, smiling.

                       JODY
          Now she's my type.



                                                       14.



                      FERGUS
          She'd be anyone's type.

                      JODY
          Don't you think of it, fucker.

                      FERGUS
          Why not?

                      JODY
          She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit
          you.

                      FERGUS
          No?

                      JODY
          Absolutely not.

                      FERGUS
          She your wife?

                      JODY
          Suppose you could say that.

Jody chuckles.

                      FERGUS
          You make a nice couple.

                      JODY
          Don't I know it.

                      FERGUS
          So what were you fucking around for,
          then?

                      JODY
          You fuckers set me up. That bitch --

                      FERGUS
          She's a friend of mine

                      JODY
          Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar.
          I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here
          anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my
          hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't
          like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe
          I'll get to understand.

                      FERGUS
          What?



                                             15.



          JODY
What the fuck am I doing here.

          FERGUS
What the fuck were you doing here?

          JODY
I got sent.

          FERGUS
You could have said no.

          JODY
Can't. Once I signed up.

          FERGUS
Why did you sign up?

          JODY
It was a job. So I get sent to the only
place in the world they call you nigger
to your face.

          FERGUS
Shouldn't take it personally.

          JODY
    (He imitates a Belfast accent)
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No
use telling them I came from Tottenham.

          FERGUS
And you play cricket?.

          JODY
Best game in the world.

          FERGUS
Ever see hurling?

          JODY
That game where a bunch of paddies whack
sticks at each other?

          FERGUS
Best game in the world.

          JODY
Never.

          FERGUS
The fastest.



                                                           16.



                        JODY
          Well, in Antigua cricket's the black
          man's game. The kids play it from the age
          of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies
          from the age of five. Then we moved to
          Tottenham and it was something different.

                        FERGUS
          How different?

                        JODY
          Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .

Fergus looks at him.

                        JODY
          So when you come to shoot me, Paddy,
          remember, you're getting rid of a shit-
          hot bowler.

                        FERGUS
          I'll bear that in mind.

He keeps looking at him.

                        FERGUS
          And by the way, it's not Paddy. It's
          Fergus.

Jody smiles.

                        JODY
          Nice to meet you, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          My pleasure, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him.

                        FERGUS
          Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by
          that tree.

                        JODY
          Tree.

He walks toward it, breathing heavily.

                        JODY
          You've got to loosen my hands.



                                                           17.



                       FERGUS
          Can't.

                       JODY
          Well then, you're going to have to take
          my dick out for me, aren t you?

Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him.

                       JODY
          Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!

Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly.

                       JODY
          Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying --

Fergus takes Jody's penis out.

Jody takes two steps toward the wall.

                       JODY
          I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all
          over myself. Will you hold my hands for
          me.

Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward.
Jody now pisses with immense relief

                       JODY
          Now, that was worth waiting for.

                       FERGUS
          Hurry up, would you?

                       JODY
          These things take time, Fergus.

He shakes his body.

                       JODY
          It's amazing how these small details take
          on such importance...

He steps back.

                       JODY
          Now put it back in.

                       FERGUS
          Give us a break.



                                                            18.



                          JODY
             I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat.
             For fuck's sake, it's got no major
             diseases.

Fergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up.

                          JODY
             Thank you. I had a case of the clap two
             years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in
             all it's served me well.

                          FERGUS
             Shut up, would you?

                          JODY
             I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you,
             Fergus.

Fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus leads Jody back to his chair.

                          JODY
             Fergus?

                          FERGUS
             Yeah?

                          JODY
             Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

He begins to laugh.

                          FERGUS
             The pleasure was all mine.

Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of
laughter.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over
his head.

Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus.



                                                              19.



                    MAGUIRE
          What the fuck is this?

                    FERGUS
          It's nothing. He's just got a sense of
          humor, that's all.

                    MAGUIRE
          You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth
          shut. Go in and get some sleep.

Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door.

                    JODY
          Yeah. Get some sleep.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking toward the house. He looks back and sees the
figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus sleeping.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody sleeping. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands,
watching him.

EXT. FARMHOUSE AND FIELDS - DAY

The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Fergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is
sitting where he sat before, stock-still.

                    FERGUS
          Did he talk?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Didn't make you laugh?

Maguire shakes his head.

                    FERGUS
          Here. Have some breakfast.

He hands Maguire a plate. Jody stirs.



                                                              20.



                    JODY
          Good morning, Fergus?

Maguire looks hard at him.

                    MAGUIRE
          So he knows your name?

                    FERGUS
          I told him.

                    MAGUIRE
          Are you all there?

He rises, and drags Fergus out the door.

                    FERGUS
          Back in a minute, Jody

EXT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

                    MAGUIRE
          You'll have minimal contact with the
          prisoner, do you hear me?

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

                    MAGUIRE
          And do you know why?

                    FERGUS
          Why?

                    MAGUIRE
          Because tomorrow we might have to shoot
          him, that's why.

Maguire goes back to the house.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Jody sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters.

                    JODY
          They giving you trouble, Fergus?

Fergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward
Jody



                                                           21.



                         JODY
             It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of
             people. Those who give and those who
             take.

Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to
feed him.

                         JODY
             Ah, take the thing off, man.

Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him.

                         JODY
             It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I
             prattle on, do you?

Fergus shakes his head and says nothing.

                         JODY
             I will take it by your silence that you
             don't.

He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody.

                         JODY
             Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the
             frog. Ever heard of them?

Fergus says nothing.

                         JODY
             Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he
             can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can,
             and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I
             give you a ride on my back, you'll go and
             sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would
             not be in my interest to sting you since
             as I'll be on your back we both would
             drown." Frog thinks about this logic for
             a while and accepts the deal. Takes the
             scorpion on his back. Braves the waters.
             Halfway over feels a burning spear in his
             side and realizes the scorpion has stung
             him after all. And as they both sink
             beneath the waves the frog cries out,
             "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for
             now we both will drown?" Scorpion
             replies, "I can't help it, it's in my
             nature."

Jody chuckles under his hood.



                                                           22.



                            FERGUS
              So what's that supposed to mean?

                            JODY
              Means what it says. The scorpion does
              what is in his nature. Take off the hood,
              man.

                            FERGUS
              Why?

                            JODY
              'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles
up at him.

                            JODY
              See? I was right about you.

                            FERGUS
              Don't be so sure.

                            JODY
              Jody's always right.

INT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.

Both men dozing in the heat.

                            JODY
              Where would you most like to be now, man?

                            FERGUS
              Doesn't matter where.

                            JODY
              Come on, man. If this shit was all over.

                            FERGUS
              Having a pint in the Rock.

                            JODY
              You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of
              something more alluring.

                            FERGUS
              Like what?

                            JODY
              Like having a pint in the Metro --

Fergus laughs.



                                             23.



              FERGUS
Having two pints in the Rock.

              JODY
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's
having a margarita.

              FERGUS
Who's Dil?

              JODY
My special friend.

              FERGUS
Oh, yeah.

              JODY
We got simple tastes, you and me.

              FERGUS
The best.

              JODY
But you fellas never get a break, do you?

              FERGUS
Do you?

              JODY
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're
finished. But you guys are never
finished, are you?

              FERGUS
We don't look on it like that.

              JODY
I've often wondered how you do it.

              FERGUS
Depends on what you believe in.

              JODY
What do you believe in?

              FERGUS
That you guys shouldn't be here.

              JODY
It's as simple as that?

              FERGUS
Yes.



                                                            24.



Jude enters.

                        JUDE
          Put that thing back on him, Fergus.

                        FERGUS
          He's hot.

                        JUDE
          Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover
          the fucker up.

                        JODY
          Have you no feelings, woman?

                        JUDE
          You shut your face --

She pulls the hood down over him.

                        JUDE
          You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

                        JODY
          He's a good soldier, Jude.

She whacks him with a pistol.

                        JUDE
          I said shut the fuck up --

                        JODY
          He believes in the future --

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's
mouth, with blood now in his lips.

                        FERGUS
          Is it bad?

                        JODY
          No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know
          that, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
          I didn't.

                        JODY
          Some kinds of women are...



                                                          25.



                      FERGUS
            She can't help it.

                      JODY
            Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.

                      FERGUS
            You liked her?

                      JODY
            Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever
            she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.
            Will you think of her too?

                      FERGUS
            Don't know her.

                      JODY
            Want you to do something, Fergus.

                      FERGUS
            What?

                      JODY
            If they kill me --

                      FERGUS
            Don't think that way.

                      JODY
            But they will. As sure as night follows
            day. They have to. I want you to find her
            out. Tell her I was thinking of her.

Fergus is moved. He can't reply.

                      JODY
            See if she's all right.

                      FERGUS
            I don't know her.

                      JODY
            Take her picture. C'mere.

Fergus walks toward him.

                      JODY
            Take it. In the inside pocket.

Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her
picture.



                                                             26.



                        JODY
          Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

                        FERGUS
          I told you not to talk that way --

                        JODY
          Go to Millie's Hair Salon in
          Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a
          margarita. Don't have to tell her who you
          are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it --

The door opens. Maguire is there, with another.

                        MAGUIRE
          Volunteer?

Fergus turns toward him.

                        MAGUIRE
          We need you inside.

Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward,
takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in
his pocket.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.

Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others.

                        MAGUIRE
          We've had word. They've used every trick
          in the book on him. He's starting to
          talk. You're going to have to do it in
          the morning.

Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods.

                        MAGUIRE
          You OK about that?

                        FERGUS
          I'm a volunteer, am n't I?

                        MAGUIRE
          Good. I was beginning to have my doubts
          about you for the last few days.

                        JUDE
          Not the only one --



                                                          27.



                            MAGUIRE
              Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep
              tonight, Fergus.

                            FERGUS
              Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Request permission to guard the prisoner
              tonight --

                            JUDE
              You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.

                            MAGUIRE
              Shut the fuck up, Jude.

He turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's
shoulder.

                            MAGUIRE
              Why do you want to do that for?

                            FERGUS
              Would make me feel better about it.

                            MAGUIRE
              You sure about that?

                            FERGUS
              I'm sure.

                            MAGUIRE
              Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.

Fergus leaves.

INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.

Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody.

Jody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound
of crying.

                            FERGUS
              Don't.

                            JODY
              I'm sorry.



                                                              28.



The crying stops.

                        JODY
          Help me.

                        FERGUS
          How can I?

                        JODY
          I don't know. Just help me. Give me a
          cigarette.

Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's
hood so he can smoke.

                        JODY
          Don't even smoke, you know that? It just
          seemed the right thing to do.

Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above
his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips.
Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth.

                        FERGUS
          Go to sleep now.

                        JODY
          I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        JODY
          A story.

                        FERGUS
          Like the one about the frog?

                        JODY
          And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

                        FERGUS
          When I was a child...

                        JODY
          Yeah?

                        FERGUS
          I thought as a child. But when I became a
          man I put away childish things...

                        JODY
          What does that mean?



                                                             29.



                       FERGUS
          Nothing.

                       JODY
          Tell me something, anything.

Fergus is silent; his eyes wet.

                       JODY
          Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?

                       FERGUS
          Me? No, I'm not good for much...

EXT. FIELDS - MORNING.

The farmhouse covered in mist. The sun coming through it.

EXT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING.

Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the
chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. He checks
the chamber.

Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his
back, by the elbow.

                       FERGUS
          Stand up, now --

Jody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire.

                       MAGUIRE
          I wish to say on behalf of the Irish
          Republican Army --

Fergus turns with sudden fierceness.

                       FERGUS
          Leave him be --

He pulls Jody through the fields.

EXT. TREES - MORNING.

Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his
back.

                       JODY
          Take the hood off, Fergus --

                       FERGUS
          No.



                                                              30.



                     JODY
          I want to see a bit. Please, please.
          Don't make me die like an animal.

Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a
cut lip where Jude struck him.

Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward.
Fergus is all cold and businesslike.

                     JODY
          I'm glad you're doing it, do you know
          that, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          Why?

                     JODY
          Cause you're my friend. And I want you to
          go to the Metro --

                     FERGUS
          Stop that talk now --

                     JODY
          Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          The fastest.

                     JODY
          Faster than cricket?

                     FERGUS
          Cricket's in the halfpenny place.

                     JODY
          So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat
          you, is there?

                     FERGUS
          You won't run.

                     JODY
          But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a
          brother in the back --

Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands,
then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in
fury after him.

                     FERGUS
          JODY!!!



                                                              31.



Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.

                            FERGUS
              You stupid bastard --

                            JODY
              What you say, faster?

                            FERGUS
              I said you bastard -- stop --

                            JODY
              Got to catch me first --

Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody
sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He
laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing,
almost laughing.

                            JODY
              Used to run the mile, you know -- four
              times round the cricket pitch -- what was
              that game called?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

                            JODY
              What?

                            FERGUS
              Hurling --

Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him.

                            JODY
              Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit
              more wind --

Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on
him again.

                            JODY
              Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?

And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to
Fergus.

                            JODY
              Told you I was fast --

Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody



                                                             32.



                        JODY
             Don't do it.

And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits
Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air
and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt
and the huge wheels grind over him.

Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees
soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns
and runs.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as
he runs.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

Tinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into
view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it,
shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits.

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Bullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the
masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the
others on the floor, scrambling for weapons.

EXT. TREES - DAY

Fergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging
branches till eventually he is hidden from sight.

EXT. CARNIVAL ON THE MONAGHAN BORDER - DAWN.

A forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields.

An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car
appears; and Fergus gets out of it.

                        TOMMY
             Fergus!

                        FERGUS
             You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're
             you keeping?

INT. CARAVAN - DAY

The old man pouring whiskey into a teacup.



                                                                33.



                        TOMMY
             You'll notice I've asked you nothing.

                        FERGUS
             That's wise, Tommy.

                        TOMMY
             All right, then. I like to be wise.

He pours Fergus more whiskey.

                        TOMMY
             So what do you need, Fergus?

                        FERGUS
             Need to go across the water.

                        TOMMY
             Do you now.

                        FERGUS
             Need to lose myself awhile.

                        TOMMY
             Aha.

He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette.

He puffs.

                        TOMMY
             There's a man I know ships cattle to
             London.

EXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING.

The ferry, churning into the sunset.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

INT. BUILDING SITE - DAY

FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in
clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at
a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in
laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the
bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and
relentlessly, like a machine.

We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls
away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust
and the growing hole.



                                                              34.



Fergus's face, as he works.

The hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of
dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.

Fergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.

The hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The
dust begins to clear.

His face.

The jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a
cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the
green.

EXT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters
through a white door.

INT. HOSTEL - DAY

Fergus dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country
boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers
of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the
soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus walking down a street looking for an address. Some
distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR
SALON.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looking in the
window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his
point of view, then Fergus walks inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Fergus enters. The door gives a loud ping.

                       A GIRL
             We're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil

She leaves the salon.

                       DIL
             You want something in particular?



                                                              35.



                        FERGUS
          Just a bit of a trim...

Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette.

                        DIL
          Come on...

She gestures toward a chair. Fergus sits down. She comes
toward him and fiddles with his hair.

She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins
to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo.

                        DIL
          Someone recommend you?

                        FERGUS
          In a way.

                        DIL
          Who?

                        FERGUS
          Guy I work with.

                        DIL
          What's his name?

Fergus can't think of an answer. The hands with the purple
nails run over his scalp.

                        FERGUS
          Doesn't the water get to your nails?

                        DIL
          What's it to you?

                        FERGUS
          Nothing.

Fergus, sitting up. She begins to cut.

                        DIL
          You American?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          Not English.



                                                              36.



                           FERGUS
             No.

                           DIL
             Scottish?

                           FERGUS
             How'd you guess?

                           DIL
             The accent, I suppose.

                           FERGUS
             And what's it like?

                           DIL
             Like treacle.

She imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs.

                           DIL
             Nice laugh.

Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds
a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks
like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them
is empty.

                           DIL
             That should make her happy.

                           FERGUS
             Who's she?

                           DIL
             Don't know. Who is she?

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through
the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her
hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He
walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.

The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of
high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy
clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door
and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub
called the Metro. Fergus follows.



                                                             37.



INT. METRO - EVENING.

Half full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way
through it.

                        BARMAN
          Hi, Dil

                        DIL
          Hiya, hon.

She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and
takes a seat.

                        BARMAN
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          A bottle of Guinness.

Dil, looking at Fergus.

                        DIL
          See that, Col?

                        COL
          See what, Dil?

                        DIL
          He gave me a look.

                        COL
          Did he?

Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink.

                        DIL
          Just cut his hair, you know.

                        COL
          Yeah?

                        DIL
          What you think?

                        COL
          Nice.

Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face
turned away, but sees him in the mirror.

                        DIL
          There, he did it again.



                                                             38.



                           COL
              Saw that one.

                           DIL
              What would you call it?

                           COL
              Now, that was a look.

She eyes Fergus in the mirror.

                           DIL
              Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.

The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus.

                           COL
              She wants to know do you want to know
              what she's drinking.

Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.

                           DIL
              A margarita.

The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at
Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her
the drink.

                           DIL
              Now he can look.... Ask him does he like
              his hair, Col.

                           COL
              She wants to know, sir, do you like your
              hair.

                           FERGUS
              Tell her I'm very happy with it.

                           DIL
              He's Scottish, Col.

                           COL
              Scottish?

                           FERGUS
              Yeah.

                           DIL
              What'd he say, Col?



                                                              39.



                         COL
           He agreed that he was.

                         DIL
           What do you think his name is?

                         COL
           I've no thoughts on the subject.

                         FERGUS
           Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         COL
           That's what he said. Jimmy.

                         DIL
           Hi, Jimmy.

                         FERGUS
           Hiya, Dil

A burly man sits down beside her. He puts his hand on her
knee.

                         MAN
           Sing the song, Dil --

She slaps the hand away.

                         DIL
           Fuck off, Dave.

                         DAVE
           C'mon, babe! You know what I like...
           Easy!

She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is
sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and
that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a
shadow.

Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow.
She shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by
the elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly
strikes her across the face with his open palm.



                                                              40.


She leans her head against a wall. Dave then puts his arms
around her, consoles her.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm. The street is
dilapidated, full of squats. They stop outside a door. Dil
opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk
inside.

Fergus stands there, observing.

A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her
shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of
Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse.
She stands absolutely still as he does so.

Fergus backs away, then walks off.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus, in bed. Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler,
running in slow motion, toward the camera. He releases the
ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily.

INT. SITE - NEXT DAY

Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He
imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a
voice interrupts him.

                        DEVEROUX
           So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?

Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type
in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is
Franknum, the cockney foreman.

                        FERGUS
           It's not Pat. It's Jim.

                        DEVEROUX
           Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as
           you remember you're not at Lords.

Fergus resumes work.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street
chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up.
Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap
colored bulbs are flashing around it.



                                                              41.



From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never
been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap
suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil. Col,
the barman, sees him and smiles.

                     COL
          So can we consider you a regular, sir?

                     FERGUS
          Is that good or bad?

                     COL
          Well, you get to say, The usual, Col.
          Things like that.

Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese
umbrellas toward him.

                     COL
          So let's call this the usual.

                     FERGUS
          Thanks.

Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts.

                     COL
          No, no. It's on me.

Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by
implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts
the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the
way.

                     COL
          Take it out, if you want.

Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and
drinks with the other.

                     COL
          You came to see her, didn't you?

Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to
his left smiles at him.

                     COL
          Something I should tell you. She's --



                                                              42.



                       FERGUS
          She's what?

The barman looks up toward the stage.

                       COL
          She's on.

THE JUKEBOX.

A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by
Dave Berry, "The Crying Game."

AT THE BAR.

Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins,
making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a
stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes
to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice
on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing
who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange
movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands.

The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of
approval or derision we can't be sure.

Fergus watching.

Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song.
The crowd cheers.

Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar,
toward him.

                       DIL
          He's still looking, Col.

                       COL
          Persistent.

                       DIL
          Good thing in a man.

                       COL
          An excellent quality.

                       DIL
          Maybe he wants something.

                       COL
          I would expect he does.



                                                             43.



                      DIL
          Ask him.

                      COL
          Ask him yourself.

She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him.

                      DIL
          So tell me.

Fergus says nothing. He shrugs.

                      DIL
          Everybody wants something.

                      FERGUS
          Not me.

                      DIL
          Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned
          and quaint. Isn't it, Col?

Col shrugs.

                      DIL
          You old-fashioned?

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

The burly man comes up to her.

                      MAN
          Got the money, Dil?

                      DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                      DAVE
          You fucking promised.

                      DIL
          Did I?

                      DAVE
          You fucking did.

He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her
drink.

                      DAVE
          Didn't you? Well, come on!



                                                              44.



He drags her through the crowd. In the mirror, Fergus watches
them go. The barman eyes him.

                        COL
              It takes all types.

                        FERGUS
              So who's he?

                        COL
              He's what she should run a mile from.

                        FERGUS
              Then why doesn't she?

                        COL
              Who knows the secrets of the human heart.

Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.

EXT. PUB - NIGHT.

Fergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no
sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an
alley. He looks up it.

P0V - ALLEY.

We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her
roughly.

                        DAVE
              Don't be like that --

                        DIL
              You heard me --

She beats his arms away. Money falls on the ground. She
staggers away from him. He picks up the money, then runs
after her.

                        DAVE
              Got very fucking grand, haven't we --

He tries to pull her back.

                        DAVE
              Talk to me, you stupid bitch --

They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't
move an inch. She smiles.



                                                             45.



                        DIL
          Hi.

                        FERGUS
          Hi. You forgot your bag.

He holds it up to show her.

                        DIL
          Thank you.

                        DAVE
          Who the fuck is he?

                        DIL
          Jimmy.

                        DAVE
          It's him, isn't it?

                        DIL
          Maybe.

Dave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on
the ground.

                        DIL
          See, they get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
                 (from the ground)
          Cunt.

Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck.

                        FERGUS
          What was that?

                        DIL
          They all get the wrong idea.

                        DAVE
          Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.

                        DIL
          Charming.

Dave grabs for her ankle. She kicks his hand away. Fergus
presses down his foot. He looks to Dil.

                        FERGUS
          What'll I do?



                                                          46.



                          DIL
            Break his neck.

Fergus presses his foot.

                          DIL
            No, don't.

She bends low to Dave.

                          DIL
            He's going to take his foot off slowly,
            David. Then you're to go home, like a
            good boy. You hear me?

                          DAVE
            Cunt.

But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs
his arm.

                          DIL
            Come on, honey.

She draws him away.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

They walk out of the alley.

                          FERGUS
            You all right?

                          DIL
            Yes, thank you.

                          FERGUS
            What was that all about?

                          DIL
            He wants me to perform for him.

                          FERGUS
            Perform?

                          DIL
            You know.

                          FERGUS
            You on the game?

                          DIL
            God no. I'm a hairdresser.



                                                              47.



Fergus looks back. Dave is rising.

                     FERGUS
          He's getting up.

                     DIL
          You can't leave me then, can you?

EXT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE DIL'S FLAT

Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs.

                     DIL
          You want me to ask you in, right?

                     FERGUS
          No, I didn't --

                     DIL
          But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud,
          but never cheap.

There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave,
holding his neck.

                     DAVE
          Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.

Dil leans close to Fergus.

                     DIL
          If you kissed me, it would really get his
          goat.

She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly.

                     DIL
          Now, if you asked me to meet you
          tomorrow, it would really drive him
          insane.

                     FERGUS
          Where?

                     DIL
          Half-five. At Millie's.

She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down
at Dave, who turns to leave.

EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus.



                                                             48.



                        DIL
          Give me that look again.

                        FERGUS
          What look?

                        DIL
          The one you gave me in the Metro.

Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She
holds them, with theatrical feeling.

                        DIL
          Darling, you shouldn't have.

She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a
classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon
pull back a curtain, and they all clap.

                        FERGUS
          What's that about?

                        DIL
          They're jealous.

                        FERGUS
          Why?

                        DIL
          I wonder.

She takes his arm and walks off with him.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks
on their table, then leaves.

                        DIL
          Now's the time you're meant to do
          something, isn't it?

                        FERGUS
          Like what?

                        DIL
          Make a pass or something. Isn't that the
          way it goes?

                        FERGUS
          Must be.



                                                              49.



EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

They are walking in an alleyway toward her house.

                        DIL
          You got a special friend, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          How special?

                        DIL
          You want one?

And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights
on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it.

                        FERGUS
          Jesus Christ!

                        DIL
          Jesus.

The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches
off.

                        FERGUS
          That Dave?

                        DIL
          The things a girl has to put up with.

She looks down toward where the car has pulled away.

                        DIL
          I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like
          him.

EXT. DIL'S FLAT.

A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus.

                        DIL
          Piss off, Dave!

                        FERGUS
          Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all
          right on your own?

                        DIL
          I'm not on my own, am I?

She touches his cheek.



                                                             50.



                        DIL
          Come on up, would you?

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil comes in in the darkness. Fergus stands like a shadow in
the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.

                        DIL
          Won't hurt you to come in.

Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an
exaggerated femininity about everything in it.

                        DIL
          Would you like a drink?

                        FERGUS
          Yes, please.

                        DIL
          What'll it be?

                        FERGUS
          Whiskey.

She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the
mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks
into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His
reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's.

She comes through with two drinks.

                        FERGUS
          Someone out there.

                        DIL
          Jesus fucking Christ.

She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in
a neck brace.

                        DIL
          Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --

                        DAVE
          It's Dave.

She goes back into the room and begins taking things up.

                        DAVE
          Talk to me, Dil --



                                                              51.



                        DIL
           Sure, Dave --

                        DAVE
           Please, Dil --

She flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a
suitcase, a teddy bear.

                        DIL
           Take your clothes.

                        DAVE
           Don't throw my clothes out the window!

                        DIL
           Fuck off back to Essex!

                        DAVE
           Fucking mad!

Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of
rejection with his things in his arms.

                        DAVE
           Don't chuck my clothes out!

                        DIL
           Take your fucking goldfish, too!

Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl
breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the
street.

                        DAVE
           You fucking bitch!

He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands.

                        DAVE
           Murderer!

Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut.

                        DIL
           Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a
           brace?

                        FERGUS
           Must be in love to manage that.

                        DIL
           Doesn't know the meaning of the word.



                                                              52.



Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass.

                       FERGUS
          He lived here with you?

                       DIL
          Tried to. Sit down, will you?

Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from
her to the picture.

                       FERGUS
          What about him?

He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink.

                       DIL
          He was different.

                       FERGUS
          How different?

                       DIL
          As different as it's possible to be.

                       FERGUS
          Tell me about him.

                       DIL
          No.

                       FERGUS
          Shouldn't I go?

                       DIL
          Yes.

And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with
her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently
passionate.

They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The
photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress
with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.

                       DIL
          No --

                       FERGUS
          Did you do that to him?

She comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close
to his ear.



                                                              53.



                        DIL
          You want to know how I kissed him?

                        FERGUS
          Yes...

                        DIL
          Are you jealous of him?

                        FERGUS
          Maybe.

                        DIL
          That's good...

She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down
his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her
hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while
her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her
mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of
Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her
head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.

                        FERGUS
          What would he think?

                        DIL
          Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He
          was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

She sits in front of the mirror.

                        FERGUS
          Do you miss him?

                        DIL
          What do you think?

                        FERGUS
          I think you do.

                        DIL
                  (dreamily)
          You say that like a gentleman.

                        FERGUS
          Do I?

                        DIL
          Like you're concerned.

Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair
from her face.



                                                             54.



                        DIL
          But you can t stay, you know that?

                        FERGUS
          Didn't think I could.

                        DIL
          A real gentleman...

She embraces him.

                        FERGUS
          Shouldn't you be in mourning?

                        DIL
          I am.

She sits back down in front of the mirror. Fergus leaves. She
reapplies her lipstick.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Singer in a blue dress. Dil and Fergus by the bar. Both
drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them
with his neck brace.

                        DAVE
          Look, I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Fuck off, Dave.

                        DAVE
          No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm
          sorry, didn't I?

                        DIL
          Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?

Fergus nods. He stands. Dave steps two feet back.

                        FERGUS
          I was only going to ask her for a dance.

Fergus takes Dil's arm.

                        FERGUS
          Shall we?

The woman is singing.

As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly. Dil
holds her cheek close to his.



                                                             55.



                      FERGUS
          Did he come here too?

                      DIL
          Is this an obsession of yours?

                      FERGUS
          Maybe.

                      DIL
          He did sometimes.

                      FERGUS
          Did he dance with you?

Dil doesn't answer. Looks at him out of the corner of her
eye.

                      DIL
          So what do you want with me, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Want to look after you.

                      DIL
          What does that mean?

                      FERGUS
          Something I heard someone say once.

She draws back and looks at him.

                      DIL
          You mean that?

                      FERGUS
          Yeah.

She dances closer.

                      DIL
          Why?

                      FERGUS
          If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

In the bar, people singing along with the music. Col sings.
Dave sitting at the bar, sulking.

                      DIL
          You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause
          Dil can't stand that.



                                                             56.



                     FERGUS
          No.

She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his
drink down.

                     DIL
          And she does get very upset...

Dave stands up to leave. On the stage the act finishes. Dil
draws Fergus back to the bar.

AT THE BAR.

Col, the barman, pours her drink.

                     DIL
          One for him, too.

Col pours and smiles.

                     DIL
          Drink.

                     FERGUS
          What is this?

                     DIL
          I'm superstitious. Drink.

He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one.

                     DIL
          Can't leave me now.

                     FERGUS
          Aha.

                     DIL
          The thing is, can you go the distance?

                     FERGUS
          Depends what it is.

                     DIL
          No, depends on nothing.

She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She
slams it back. He sips.

                     DIL
          In one.



                                                              57.



She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket
whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the
photographs.

                           DIL
              What you thinking of, hon?

                           FERGUS
              I'm thinking of your man.

                           DIL
              Why?

                           FERGUS
              I'm wondering why you keep his things.

                           DIL
              Told you, I'm superstitious.

She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her
shoulders.

                           FERGUS
              Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?

                           DIL
              All the time.

Fergus runs his hand down her throat.

                           DIL
              Even now.

                           FERGUS
              No...

                           DIL
              He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.

She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him
down. They kiss passionately.

                           DIL
              Give me one minute.

She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at
the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She
comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks
extraordinarily beautiful.



                                                              58.


He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward
him. He begins to kiss her face and neck.

                            FERGUS
              Would he have minded?

She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her
shoulders.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness.
Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently,
with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a
close-up, that she is a man.

Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.

                            DIL
              You did know, didn't you?

Fergus says nothing.

                            DIL
              Oh my God.

She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch
him. Fergus smacks the hand away.

                            FERGUS
              Jesus. I feel sick --

He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet.

                            DIL
              Don't go, Jimmy --

He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into
the tub.

She crouches on the floor.

                            DIL
              I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

He retches again.

                            DIL
              What were you doing in the bar if you
              didn't know -- I'm bleeding...

She lights a cigarette.

Fergus runs the taps. He washes his face, rinses his mouth.



                                                              59.



                        DIL
          It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.
          Just not on the face.

Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the
kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A
trace of blood on her mouth.

                        DIL
          Y'see, I'm not a young thing any
          longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't
          you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you
          expected.

Fergus comes out of the bathroom.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

She looks up. Some hope in her face.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him.

                        DIL
          Don't go like that. Say something...

He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor.

                        DIL
          Jesus.

He drags himself away and runs down the stairs.

INT. FERGUS'S FLAT

Fergus in bed. Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in
cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

The place is hopping. Fergus enters. He now sees it as he
should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar.
He makes his way through the crowds. All the women too-
heavily made-up. Some beautifully sleek young things he looks
at he realizes are young men. He makes his way to the bar
where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it.
Her face is bruised. She is wearing dark glasses.

As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. She talks
to Col the barman.



                                                          60.



                          DIL
            He's back, Col

                          COL
            Hi.

                          DIL
            Don't want any of those looks, Col. They
            don't mean much.

                          COL
            Stop it, Dil --

                          DIL
            No. Tell him to go fuck himself.

Fergus sits. Col turns to him.

                          COL
            She wants me to tell you go fuck
            yourself.

                          FERGUS
            I'm sorry.

There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark
glasses.

                          DIL
            Tell him to stop messing Dil around --

                          FERGUS
            Dil --

                          DIL
            Tell him it hurt --

                          FERGUS
            I have to talk to her, Col --

                          COL
            Says he's got to talk to you --

Fergus touches her arm.

                          FERGUS
            Come on, Dil --

                          DIL
            Where?

She whips her arm away.



                                                              61.



                        DIL
          Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --

She walks into the crowd, toward the door.

Fergus leaves.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room
are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,
pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We
hear the song "The Crying Game."

Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and
sticks it in the letter box.

EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY

A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with
a pole and replaces it with a number nine.

Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn
toward the building where Fergus is working.

INT. SITE - DAY

Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the
pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving
glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch
basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high
heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks
out.

Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving
toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.
As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,
which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a
ladder toward Fergus .

                        DEVEROUX
          How much did that frame cost, Mr.
          Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.



                                                              62.



                        DEVEROUX
          Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,
          will it, Mr. Franknum?

                        FRANKNUM
          Not in my experience.

                        DEVEROUX
          Off his wages.

                        FERGUS
          Do you mean that?

                        DEVEROUX
          He wants to know do I mean that.

                        FRANKNUM
          I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.

                        DEVEROUX
          Bloody right I do...

Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf
whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window
should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at
her, looking up her skirt, etc.

She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?

                        FERGUS
          She's not a tart.

                        DEVEROUX
          No, of course not, she's a lady.

                        FERGUS
          She's not that either.

Fergus walks out of the room.

Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves,
sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.

                        DIL
          Darling --

She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is
wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She
pecks him on the cheek.



                                                       63.



                      DIL
          Never let the sun go down on an argument,
          Jody used to say.

                      FERGUS
          What you doing here?

                      DIL
          Got your note. So let's kiss and make up,
          hon.

                      FERGUS
          Don't call me that.

                      DIL
          Sorry, darling.

                      FERGUS
          Give it over, Dil --

                      DIL
          Apologies, my sweet.

Fergus smiles in spite of himself.

                      DIL
          That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.

She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.

                      FERGUS
          You're something else, Dil, you know
          that?

                      DIL
          Never said a truer word.

She hands him a neatly cut sandwich.

                      DIL
          See, I was always best looking after
          someone. Must be something in the genes.

                      FERGUS
          Must be.

                      DIL
          And the fact that you didn't know is
          basically the fault of yours truly. And
          even when you were throwing up, I could
          tell you cared.



                                                       64.



                        FERGUS
          You could?

                        DIL
          Do you care, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Sure I do.

                        DIL
          You mean that?

                        FERGUS
          Yeah. I care, Dil.

She lowers her head.

                        FERGUS
          You crying, Dil?

He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.

                        DIL
          I'm tired and emotional.

Then he hears a voice behind him.

                        DEVEROUX
          Do it on your own time, Paddy.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DEVEROUX
          Whatever it is she does for you.

Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.

                        FERGUS
          If I was her I'd consider that an insult.

                        DEVEROUX
          Consider it how you like. Just get that
          bloody tart out of here.

Fergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.

                        FERGUS
          Did you ever pick your teeth up with
          broken fingers?

Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.



                                                          65.



                      DEVEROUX
          What's that supposed to mean?

                      FERGUS
          It's a simple question.

Deveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.

                      FERGUS
          Come on, dear.

He holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it.
Her face is wreathed in a smile.

                      DIL
          He didn't answer, honey --

Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.

                      FRANKNUM
          Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.

                      DIL
          My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.

                      FERGUS
          Shut up.

                      DIL
          Made me feel all funny inside.

                      FERGUS
          I said stop it.

                      DIL
          Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.

                      FERGUS
          You think that's wise?

                      DIL
          Nothing's wise.

The lift stops with a thud.

                      FERGUS
          I didn't mean to hit you.

                      DIL
          I know that.



                                                            66.



                        FERGUS
          Kind of liked you as a girl.

                        DIL
          That's a start.

                        FERGUS
          So I'm sorry.

                        DIL
          Make it up to me, then.

                        FERGUS
          How?

                        DIL
          Ask to meet me again.

                        FERGUS
          Will you meet me again?

                        DIL
          When?

                        FERGUS
          Whenever. Tonight.

She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of
catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him
back up to the site.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off
her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling.
Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.

                        FERGUS
          Do they know?

                        DIL
          Know what, honey?

                        FERGUS
          Know what I didn't know. And don't call
          me that.

                        DIL
          Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her
          feelings.

                        FERGUS
          Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.



                                                          67.



                       DIL
          Details, baby, details.

                       FERGUS
          So they do know.

                       DIL
          All right, they do.

She takes his arm as they walk off.

                       FERGUS
          Don't.

                       DIL
          Sorry.

                       FERGUS
          I should have known, shouldn't I?

                       DIL
          Probably.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of wish I didn't.

                       DIL
          You can always pretend.

                       FERGUS
          That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't
          he?

                       DIL
          Absolutely.

                       FERGUS
          Won't be quite the same though, will it?

                       DIL
          Are you pretending yet?

                       FERGUS
          I'm working on it.

Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look.

                       FERGUS
          There's Dave. He knew too.

                       DIL
          Stop it, Jimmy.



                                                          68.



                        FERGUS
          Am I becoming repetitious?

                        DIL
          A little.

                        FERGUS
          Sorry.

They reach her door. The car stops.

                        FERGUS
          Don't ask me in.

                        DIL
          Please, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          No. Can't pretend that much.

                        DIL
          I miss you, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          Should have stayed a girl.

                        DIL
          Don't be cruel.

                        FERGUS
          Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.

                        DIL
          Only if you kiss me.

Fergus kisses her. He looks at her open lips as if in
disbelief at himself.

                        FERGUS
          Happy now?

                        DIL
          Delirious.

She goes inside.

INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light.
Then he hears a voice.

                        JUDE
          Hello, stranger.



                                                            69.



He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark
brown.

                        JUDE
          You vanished.

He stares at her, says nothing.

                        JUDE
          What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the
          gaff on us or did you just fuck up?

                        FERGUS
          Leave me alone, Jude.

                        JUDE
          No. That's the last thing I'll do. You
          never asked what happened.

                        FERGUS
          I heard.

                        JUDE
          Eddie and Tinker died.

                        FERGUS
          I know.

                        JUDE
          Maguire and me got out by the skin of our
          teeth. No thanks to you.... What you
          think of the hair?

                        FERGUS
          Suits you.

She walks round the room.

                        JUDE
          Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a
          tougher look, if you know what I mean.

She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black
leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.

                        JUDE
          Fuck me, Fergus.

He takes her hand away.

                        JUDE
          Am I to take it that's a no?



                                                       70.



He says nothing.

                     JUDE
          We had a court-martial in your absence.
          They wanted to put a bullet in your head.
          I pleaded for clemency. Said we should
          find out what happened first. So what did
          happen?

                     FERGUS
          He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.
          I tried to catch him. He made it to the
          road and got hit by a Saracen.

                     JUDE
          So you did fuck up.

                     FERGUS
          Yes.

                     JUDE
          But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

                     FERGUS
          No, what is the thing?

                     JUDE
          You vanished quite effectively. Became
          Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how
          useful that could be.

                     FERGUS
          What do you mean?

                     JUDE
          We've got some plans here. And we'll need
          a Mister Nobody to execute them.

                     FERGUS
          No way, Jude. I'm out.

                     JUDE
          You're never out, Fergus.

She looks at him hard. He looks away.

                     JUDE
          Maybe you don't care whether you die or
          not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The
          wee black chick.

He leaps up from the bed.



                                                          71.



                    FERGUS
          Leave her out of this.

                    JUDE
          Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.
          You know we won't leave her out of this.
          But I'm glad to see you care.

She brings her lips close to his so they touch.

                    JUDE
          And I must admit I'm curious.

He grabs her hair and pulls her head back.

                    FERGUS
          What the fuck do you know, Jude?

She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.

                    JUDE
          You fucking tell me, boy --

Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly:

                    FERGUS
          She's nobody. She likes me.

                    JUDE
          So I suppose a fuck is out of the
          question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No
          sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.
          You'll be hearing from us.

She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.

                    JUDE
          Keep the faith.

She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.

EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand.

He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then
the chair turns and we see it is Jude.

Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling
brightly, then talking back to Dil



                                                          72.



INT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.

                        JUDE
          He your boyfriend?

Jude, turning in the chair.

                        JUDE
          Lucky you.

INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

                        DIL
          Carnations.

                        FERGUS
          What?

                        DIL
          He'd bring me carnations.

                        FERGUS
          So I got it wrong, then.

                        DIL
          Not at all, honey.

                        FERGUS
          Don't.

                        DIL
          Okay.

She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and
sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly.

He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-
marches her out.

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          Why, honey --

                        FERGUS
          Come on.

                        DIL
          You gonna tell me why?

                        FERGUS
          No.



                                                              73.



As they pass Jude, she smiles.

EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.

Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away.

                       DIL
          What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong
          --

                       FERGUS
          Not here.

They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising.

INT. METRO - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar.

                       DIL
          You gonna tell me what it is?

A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude.

                       JUDE
          What was it?

                       DIL
          You know her, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?

                       FERGUS
          Dil, this is Jude.

                       DIL
          You following me?

                       JUDE
          Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to
          you, Dil?

                       DIL
          Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

                       JUDE
          That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as
          they say.

                       DIL
          Absolutely. The younger the better.
          Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.



                                                    74.



                      JUDE
          Don't go looking for it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.

                      JUDE
          A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she,
          Jimmy?

                      DIL
          A girl has to have a bit of glamour.

                      JUDE
          Absolutely. Long as she can keep it.
          Isn't that right, James...

She leaves. Dil watches her go.

                      DIL
          It's her, isn't it?

                      FERGUS
          What's her?

                      DIL
          She's the thing you had to tell me.

                      FERGUS
          Kind of.

                      DIL
          I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really
          sorry.

She looks at Col

                      DIL
          You see that, Col?

                      COL
          Saw it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fuck it, is what I say.

                      COL
          Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.

                      DIL
          Fucking men, Col --



                                                              75.



                       COL
          Fuck 'em.

There are tears in her eyes. She stands.

                       DIL
          And fuck you, Jimmy --

She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an
expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very
small.

                       COL
          You could always make it up to her.

                       FERGUS
          How?

                       COL
          When a girl runs out like that, she
          generally wants to be followed.

                       FERGUS
          She's not a girl, Col --

                       COL
          Whatever you say.

But Fergus rises and walks out.

EXT. METRO - NIGHT.

A figure standing down the alleyway, smoking. Fergus looks
toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting.

                       JUDE
          She went that way --

Jude grabs his arm.

                       JUDE
          But you come with me.

She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting.
They get inside.

ANOTHER CAR - BY THE PUB.

Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting
in the car.



                                                            76.



INT. CAR - NIGHT.

In the moving car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her.
Fergus sits in the back.

                     FERGUS
          So it was you all the time.

                     MAGUIRE
          Who'd you think it was?

                     FERGUS
          I thought it was Dave.

                     MAGUIRE
          And who's Dave when he's at home?

                     FERGUS
          He's at home.

                     MAGUIRE
          Should blow you away, you know that?

                     FERGUS
          I know that.

Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks
him on the teeth with his closed fist.

                     MAGUIRE
          I'm getting emotional. And I don't want
          to get fucking emotional -- you
          understand, Hennessy?

                     FERGUS
          I understand.

                     MAGUIRE
          Fuck you, too --

Jude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the
street outside.

                     JUDE
          Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.

                     MAGUIRE
          That true, Fergus? You in love?

                     FERGUS
          Absolutely.



                                                             77.



                           MAGUIRE
             And what's she like between the sheets?

                           FERGUS
             Definitely unusual.

                           MAGUIRE
             And who is she?

                           FERGUS
             Just a girl.

                           MAGUIRE
             And you know what'll happen if you fuck
             up again, don't you?

                           FERGUS
             Aye, I do, Peter.

                           MAGUIRE
             Good.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

The car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors
down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative
club.

In the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the
building.

                           MAGUIRE
             So what do you think that is, Hennessy?

                           FERGUS
             A hotel?

                           MAGUIRE
             It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh?
             He visits his ladies on Tuesday and
             Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.
             His security's in the car beyond.

He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away.
Fergus looks from the window to the car.

                           FERGUS
             Who is he?

                           MAGUIRE
             Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we
             would call a legitimate target.



                                                          78.



                       FERGUS
          Thank God for that.

                       MAGUIRE
          You being cynical, Hennessy?

                       FERGUS
          Hope not.

                       MAGUIRE
          Good. So what do you think?

                       FERGUS
          Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men
          are any good. And I presume you can't get
          in.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          So it's on the street.

                       MAGUIRE
          Right.

                       FERGUS
          Kind of suicide, isn't it?

Jude turns around to look at him.

                       FERGUS
          But, then, I don't have a choice.

                       JUDE
          Och, you do, Fergie.

                       FERGUS
          Of course. I forgot.

                       JUDE
          Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.

Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the
street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-
bar with some tables outside.

EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.

Fergus and Jude, crossing the street.

                       JUDE
          You keep your mind on the job, boy --



                                                              79.



                    FERGUS
          And then you'll leave her out of it?

                    JUDE
          Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

They take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel
down the way.

                    JUDE
          He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to
          get to the door.

She checks her watch. Fergus is sweating.

                    FERGUS
          And what if I say no?

                    JUDE
          You know what. Go.

Down by the brothel, the door swings open.

Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel.
There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it.
The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens.

Fergus quickens his pace.

Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking.

The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the
pavement, through the passersby, toward the car.

A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward
the old gent.

Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes
between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes
Fergus's elbow.

                    GENT
          Pardon me, young man --

Fergus walks on.

Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old
man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler.
Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off.

When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks
back.



                                                           80.



Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.

                       JUDE
          You were made for this.

                       FERGUS
          Was I?

                       JUDE
          Perfect.

                       FERGUS
          And what happens then?

                       JUDE
          We'll be on the other side. We'll move
          when you do.

                       FERGUS
          And what if you don't?

                       JUDE
          Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

                       FERGUS
          You may be right.

                       JUDE
          Stay late at your work tomorrow night and
          I'll bring you the gear.

Jude begins to walk away.

                       FERGUS
          Jude?

                       JUDE
          Yes?

                       FERGUS
          Who's the old geezer?

                       JUDE
          Some judge...

She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car.
Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes
inside; he follows.

                       FERGUS
          Why'd you follow me, Dil?



                                                              81.



                      DIL
          Was jealous, Jimmy.

She downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high.

                      FERGUS
          Shouldn't be, Dil

                      DIL
          Why shouldn't I be jealous?

There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand
and begins to wipe her face.

                      DIL
          Don't. My makeup.

She sits down; he joins her.

                      DIL
          She own you, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          Yes.

                      DIL
          She from Scotland too?

                      FERGUS
          You could say that.

                      DIL
          And you're not going to tell me more?

                      FERGUS
          I can't.

He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the
tissue in her drink and wipes some more.

                      DIL
          What you doing, Jimmy?

                      FERGUS
          I'm not sure.

                      DIL
          Do you like me even a little bit?

                      FERGUS
          More than that.

Dil's face, staring at him.



                                                            82.



                           FERGUS
             Come on, let's go for a walk.

She allows herself to be led out.

EXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window.

                           FERGUS
             You do something for me, Dil?

                           DIL
             Anything.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

                           DIL
             Afraid so.

                           FERGUS
             You got the keys to the shop?

They walk inside.

INT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.

Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness.

                           DIL
             You want another haircut, baby?

                           FERGUS
             No. Sit down.

He sits her down in one of the chairs.

                           FERGUS
             You'd do anything for me?

Dil nods.

                           DIL
             Anything.

Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head
leaps back.

                           DIL
             No way --



                                                             83.



                        FERGUS
          You said anything, Dil

                        DIL
          A girl has to draw the line somewhere --

                        FERGUS
          Want to change you to a man, Dil...

She stares at him.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          It's a secret.

                        DIL
          You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          And you wouldn't leave me?

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

She takes a breath.

                        DIL
          Go on, then.

Fergus begins to cut.

CLOSE-UP ON DlL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream
down her cheeks.

                        DIL
          You're no good at this, Jimmy.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry.

But he keeps cutting. He gives Dil a short, cropped military
cut like Jody's.



                                                              84.



                    DIL
          You want to make me look like him...

                    FERGUS
          No. Want to make you into something new.
          That nobody recognizes...

She looks in the mirror at it in the dark.

                    DIL
          Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the
light. He stops her hand.

                    FERGUS
          No.

She looks at her hand on his.

                    FERGUS
          Better in the dark.

Her fingers close around his.

                    DIL
          So it's true, then?

                    FERGUS
          What?

                    DIL
          You like me better like this.

                    FERGUS
          Yes.

She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His
hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons.

                    DIL
          Oh, Jimmy --

Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. She
falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.

                    FERGUS
          No. No. Dil... get up...

He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She
stretches languorously down on it.



                                                              85.


He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. She turns on
the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing
suspender-belts underneath her skirt.

                        DIL
          Baby...

But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe
where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns.

                        DIL
          What are you doing, honey...

We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with
Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --

                        DIL
          Sorry. What you doing?

Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.

                        FERGUS
          Try this on, Dil

He wraps the shirt around her.

                        DIL
          Why?

                        FERGUS
          For me.

                        DIL
          For you...

She kisses him.

EXT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down
the street and inside.

                        DIL
          Why are we going here, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Look on it like a honeymoon.



                                                              86.



INT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on
a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts
out the cigarette.

Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes.
Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on
his coat, and walks out.

EXT. SITE - EVENING.

A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel
in her hand.

INT. SITE - EVENING.

Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude.

                        JUDE
          You a handyman, Fergie?

                        FERGUS
          I take pride in my work.

                        JUDE
          I sincerely hope so.

Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something
from the bag.

                        JUDE
          Tools of the trade.

She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly.

                        JUDE
          And forget about the girl.

Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There
is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.

INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.

Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls.

                        FERGUS
          Dil?

No reply. He runs outside.



                                                              87.



EXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in
her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil
walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her.

                        FERGUS
          Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing
          here?

                        DIL
          I'm going home!

                        FERGUS
          Told you to stay in the hotel!

                        DIL
          Thought you was fooling me. Thought you
          was leaving me.

They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very
drunk.

                        FERGUS
          I had to go to work!

                        DIL
          Stayed all day in that room thinking
          every noise was you. There's something
          you're not telling me, Jimmy.

He takes her arm.

                        FERGUS
          Come on...

                        DIL
          No! I'm going home...

Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat.

                        DIL
          So tell me.

                        FERGUS
          I was trying to get out of something.

                        DIL
          No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.

Fergus looks at her.



                                                             88.



                       FERGUS
             You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.

                       DIL
             You mean that?

                       FERGUS
             Yes.

And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue.

                       FERGUS
             Stop it, would you?

There is no response. He shakes her.

                       FERGUS
             Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --

Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She
opens her eyes slowly.

                       DIL
             Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood
             condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy,
             then I'll be all right.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.

He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then
goes to the window to check the street outside.

She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey.

                       FERGUS
             You heard what I said, Dil?

                       DIL
             My pills...

She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the
bathroom.

                       FERGUS
             What pills?

                       DIL
             Prescription. For my condition.

                       FERGUS
             What condition?



                                                             89.



                         DIL
           My condition. Ennui.

He goes and gets the pills.

She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey
bottle.

                         FERGUS
           Are you supposed to take that many?

                         DIL
           Only in times of extreme stress.

She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down.

                         DIL
           See, they all say good-bye sometime.
           'Cept for him.

She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus.

                         FERGUS
           Are you all right, Dil?

                         DIL
           I will be.

She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands
between her knees.

                         DIL
           Go on, then.

Fergus walks slowly toward the door.

                         FERGUS
           Good-bye, Dil

                         DIL
           Jimmy?

                         FERGUS
           What?

                         DIL
           Don't go like that.

She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly
attractive about her.

                         DIL
           Can't help what I am.



                                                              90.



He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips.

We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus
looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic
haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his.

                       DIL
          Knew you had a heart...

Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it.

                       FERGUS
          Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your
          man.

                       DIL
          You knew which man?

                       FERGUS
          Your soldier.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred,
her eyes far away.

                       FERGUS
          Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast.
          Held him hostage for three days.

                       DIL
          You knew my Jody?

                       FERGUS
          Are you listening?

Dil smiles woozily.

                       DIL
          Yes.

                       FERGUS
          I got the order to shoot him. Before I
          could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and
          died.

                       DIL
          Died...

                       FERGUS
          Did you hear me?



                                                             91.



                        DIL
          You killed my Jody?

                        FERGUS
          In a manner of speaking.

                        DIL
          It was you...

She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere.

                        FERGUS
          You should scream. You should beat my
          head off.

She woozily tries to hit him round the face.

                        DIL
          You killed my Jody

                        FERGUS
          No.

                        DIL
          You didn't.

                        FERGUS
          I suppose I tried.

                        DIL
          You tried.

                        FERGUS
          Don't you want to kill me?

Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him.

                        DIL
          Bang...

He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepily

                        DIL
          Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me,
          too.

                        FERGUS
          Okay.

Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks
down at her, almost fondly.



                                                             92.



INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes.
She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a
chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the
gun.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties
them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties
them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to
wake him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties
that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is
drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking
so it is secure.

                       FERGUS
             What the fuck --

Dil speaks unnaturally quietly.

                       DIL
             So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.

Jude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and
slips it in her handbag.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.

Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand.

                       DIL
             Didn't really listen last night. I heard
             but I didn't listen.

Fergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings.



                                                              93.



                     DIL
          That won't do you no good. Dil knows how
          to tie a body.

She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus.

                     DIL
          Wondered why you came on to me like that
          when you gave me the look.

                     FERGUS
          He asked me to see were you all right.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jude on the street. Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she
gets inside.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

                     DIL
          See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me.
          Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

                     FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                     DIL
          Just don't kick Dil and she'll be
          touched. Be nice to her and she'll be
          yours forever.

She looks at him, tears in her eyes.

                     DIL
          See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I
          can't do that. Yet.

                     FERGUS
          Let me go, Dil

He drags at his bindings.

                     DIL
          Why?

                     FERGUS
          Got to be somewhere.

                     DIL
          Try and go, then.



                                                              94.



EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

The figure of the judge in the window. Outline of a woman.
Jude and Maguire are in the car, parked across the street.
They look toward a paper seller.

                       MAGUIRE
          Where the fuck is he? Christ --

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings.

                       FERGUS
          Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or
          they'll be here

                       DIL
          Let them come then.

IN THE CAR. OUTSIDE BROTHEL.

                       JUDE
          Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around
          once more --

He drives off.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus collapsed back on the bed, exhausted.

                       DIL
          Just want your company for a little while
          longer...

EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAY

Maguire's car driving round once more. No sign of Fergus.

                       MAGUIRE
          That fucker's dead --

                       JUDE
          No, we are.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus strains and roars from the bed.

                       FERGUS
          You don't know what you're doing, Dil --



                                                              95.



                        DIL
          Never did...

MAGUIRE'S POINT OF VIEW -- the brothel door opening. The
elderly judge comes out. The car with his security men guns
up.

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the shooter, Jude --

                        JUDE
          You're crazy --

                        MAGUIRE
          Give me the fucking shooter!

He grabs it from her pocket. Throws open the door and runs
across the street. Jude dives into the driver's seat.

INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Fergus, pulling at his bindings.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROTHEL.

The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open
by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The
goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three
times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls
an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other
goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the
pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead.

INT. DIL'S FLAT - DAY

Dil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like
a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck --
"The Crying Game" song. She comes to the bed, and points the
gun at Fergus's head.

                        DIL
          You like me now, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          I like you, Dil --

                        DIL
          Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.

                        FERGUS
          More what?



                                                           96.



                       DIL
          More endearments.

                       FERGUS
          I like you, DIl

                       DIL
          Love me.

                       FERGUS
          Yes.

                       DIL
          Tell me you love me.

                       FERGUS
          Whatever you say, Dil.

                       DIL
          Then say it.

                       FERGUS
          Love you, Dil.

                       DIL
          You do?

                       FERGUS
          Yeah.

                       DIL
          What would you do for me?

                       FERGUS
          Anything.

She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest.

                       DIL
          Say it again.

                       FERGUS
          I'd do anything for you, Dil.

She pulls on his bindings to release him.

EXT. STREET.

Two police cars, sirens wailing.



                                                              97.



INT. DIL'S FLAT.

Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound
his hands are nearly undone.

                        DIL
          And you'll never leave me?

                        FERGUS
          Never.

                        DIL
          I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice
          to hear it.

His arm is free. He strokes her hair.

                        FERGUS
          I'm sorry, Dil.

She shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the
background.

Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a
gun.

                        JUDE
          You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough.
          But twice.

Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude.

                        DIL
          You didn't knock, honey --

Dil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the
floor.

                        FERGUS
          Dil!

                        JUDE
          Get that thing off me, Fergus --

Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude.

                        DIL
          What was that she called you, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.



                                                             98.



                    DIL
          What's Fergus?

                    FERGUS
          It's my name, Dil --

                    DIL
          What happened to Jimmy?

                    JUDE
          I said get it off me, Fergus --

Jude, on the floor, reaches for her gun. Manages to grab it.

                    DIL
          What's she going to do, Jimmy? She going
          to blow you away?

Dil shoots again, like a child, playing with a toy. She hits
Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, the gun the
other.

                    DIL
          Was she there too? When you got my Jody?

Fergus screams


                    FERGUS
          Dil!!!

                    DIL
          I asked you a question, honey -- were you
          there too --

                    JUDE
          You sick bitch --

As she raises the gun, Dil shoots her repeatedly, saying:

                    DIL
          You was there, wasn't you? You used those
          tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?

Fergus screams from the bed. He rips free his other arm. Dil
shoots Jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in
blood. Dil turns the gun on Fergus.

                    DIL
          She was there, wasn't she?



                                                          99.



                        FERGUS
          She was --

                        DIL
          And she used her tits and that cute
          little ass to get him, didn't she?

                        FERGUS
          Yes.

                        DIL
          Tell me what she wore.

                        FERGUS
          Can't remember...

Dil points the gun at him, squeezing on the trigger. Then she
stops.

                        DIL
          Can't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.

She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front
of it.

                        DIL
          You won't let me, Jody --

She raises the gun and places it in her mouth. Fergus takes
it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. He lifts
her up by the shoulders.

                        FERGUS
          You've got to go now, Dil --

                        DIL
          Do I?

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Now.

                        DIL
          Am I in trouble, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Not if you go.

                        DIL
          Will I see you again?

                        FERGUS
          You will, Dil



                                                             100.



                        DIL
          Promise?

                        FERGUS
          I promise.

                        DIL
          Where am I to go, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          The Metro.

                        DIL
          Meet Col --

                        FERGUS
          Yes. Say hello to Col --

He leads her out the door. Fergus goes back into the room,
past Jude's body. Looks out the window to where he can see
Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have
gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches
Dil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees
the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the
house. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove
Dil's fingerprints. He turns to the picture of the soldier;
talks to it.

                        FERGUS
          You should have stayed at home.

He sits in the chair by the window, waiting.

                                                FADE TO BLACK.

INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

FADE UP to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in
the windows. Large barred doors open and a group of women
come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc. Among them
is Dil, looking resplendent. She walks past the rows of
convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where
Fergus sits, waiting.

                        DIL
          Got you the multivitamins and the iron
          tablets, hon --

                        FERGUS
          Don't call me that --



                                                        101.



                        DIL
          Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are
          magnesium supplement --

                        FERGUS
          Stop it, Dil --

                        DIL
          I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm
          counting the days. Two thousand three
          hundred and thirty-four left.

                        FERGUS
          Thirty-five.

                        DIL
          I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the
          leap year. What am I supposed to call you
          then, Jimmy?

                        FERGUS
          Fergus.

                        DIL
          Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life -
          -

                        FERGUS
          Please, Dil --

                        DIL
          Can't help it. You're doing time for me.
          No greater love, as the man says. Wish
          you'd tell me why.

                        FERGUS
          As the man said, it's in my nature.

                        DIL
          What's that supposed to mean?

She shakes her head.

                        FERGUS
          Well, there was this scorpion, you see.
          And he wants to go across the river. But
          he can't swim. So he goes to this frog,
          who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse
          me, Mr. Froggy..."



                                                           102.



CAMERA PULLS BACK, and as Fergus tells the story of the
scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your
Man."

                                                    FADE OUT.

    As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink
    open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN
    near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind
    blowing, rattling a window.

                            A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
              What are you looking at?

              The wind, Mother... They say a
              hurricane is on its way... You've
              been asleep... I was waiting to
              see you...

1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1

    Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white
    enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
    An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green
    turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her
    blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's
    connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
    drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a
    Southern lilt.

                            DAISY
              If it wasn't for hurricanes we
              wouldn't have a hurricane season.

                            CAROLINE
              I've forgotten what the weather
              can be like here. I've lived with
              four seasons so many years now.

    We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER,
    in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the
    window...

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              I saw on the news they're
              predicting trouble...

              firewood to close a hole in a
              levee.

    But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...

                                                                    2.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 It all runs together... like a
                 fingerpainting... I feel like I'm
                 on a boat, drifting...

                               CAROLINE
                      (tenderly)
                 Can I do anything for you, Mother?
                 Make anything easier?

                                DAISY
                 Hmmm. There is nothing to do,
                 Caroline. This is what it is...
                 I'm finding it harder to keep my
                 eyes open... my mouth all filled
                 with cotton...

    And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her
    nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take
    it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.

                               DOROTHY BAKER
                 There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll
                 scratch yourself to ribbons...
                      (to Caroline)
                 It's their way of letting go...
                      (the finality)
                 ...prob'ly today.

    Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her
    admonition of death being so close at hand, makes
    everything even more present...

                               CAROLINE
                 Do you want more medication,
                 Mother? The doctor said you can
                 have all you want.

    Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline,
    seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to
    cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter,
    comforting her.

                               CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                 A friend told me she never had a
                 chance to say goodbye to her
                 mother.
                      (grateful to have the
                       chance)
                 I wanted to thank you, Mother, for
                 bringing me into this world. For
                 raising me so well.

              I wanted to tell you how much
              you've meant to me. I'm going to
              miss you so much...

    They hold each other for some time... They separate...
    And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
    about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in
    their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal
    question...

                            CAROLINE (CONT'D)
              Are you afraid?

                             DAISY
              Curious.   What comes next...

    She winces at some physical pain.

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              The pain's coming more steadily...
              Her breathing will falter soon...
              No need for her to suffer..

    She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes...
    drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a
    sound, crosses her mind... and she says...

                            DAISY
              They built that train station in
              1918. Your father was there the
              day it opened... He said a tuba
              band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...

2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2

    And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
    ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
    TRAIN STATION...

                            DAISY
              Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The
              finest clockmaker in all of the
              South built that clock...

3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3

    We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless
    array of clocks and watches...

                            DAISY'S (V.O.)
              His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr.
              Cake.

                                                                3A.



4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4

    The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to
    herself again... "Mr. Cake..."

5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5

    We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small,
    delicate hands, "Mr. Cake," working in his downstairs
    workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a
    handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 He was married to a Creole of
                 Evangeline Parish and they had a
                 son.

    Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.

                               DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from
                 birth, absolutely blind.

6   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917              6

    ...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 And when their son came of age,
                 like boys will do, he joined the
                 army. They saw him off at the old
                 train station.

7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7

    An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his
    parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
    soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his
    hat goodbye to his son...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 Oh how he worked, for months he
                 did nothing but work on the clock
                 for the great train station.

8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8

    The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at
    work...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 One day a letter came...

    Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her
    hand... She reads to her blind husband...

                               BLANCHE DEVEREUX
                 "I am sorry to inform you that
                 your son was killed fighting for
                 his country, at the battle of the
                 Marne. In the death of Sgt.
                 Martin Gateau I lose one of my
                 most trusted men.

                  When I informed members of our
                  company he had fallen, on every
                  face could be seen the mark of
                  sorrow... ...we were in hope the
                  Lord would spare him to return
                  home together... Alas this was not
                  to be. I send along his pants,
                  shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and
                  haircomb."

                                DAISY (V.O.)
                  Mr. Gateau, done for the night,
                  went up to his bed.

     Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  And their son came home.

9    EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                9

     We see "Mr. Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding
     his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  They buried him where the Gateau
                  family had been buried for a
                  hundred and seven years...

10   EXT. NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1918                          10

     An old New Orleans cemetery, vines crawling the
     sepulchers.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Mr. Cake went back to work on his
                  clock... laboring to finish...

11   INT. THE CLOCK WORKSHOP, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1918        11

     Mr. Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up
     the clock back... finished at last.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  It was a morning to remember...
                  Papa said there were people
                  everywhere...

12   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918            12

     And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling
     of the clock. Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets
     alike...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                  6.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Even Teddy Roosevelt had come.

     And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt,
     in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders. We
     watch Mr. Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing
     the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape...
     He stands for a moment... and with a simple tug, releases
     the purple swath... People gasp at the magnificent
     clock... "Mr. Cake" winds the clock, which chimes a
     glorious chime... Pushed by an angel, the second-hand
     begins its eternal journey...going around... Everyone
     cheers... until they realize the clock is going the wrong
     way... traveling backwards in time... A man shouts, "It's
     running backwards!"

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  I made it this way... so that
                  perhaps, the boys who were lost in
                  the war might stand and go home
                  again...

13   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY, 1918                                13

     And we see just that... bullets leaving mens' wounds
     sailing back into the rifles from whence they came...
     limbs, whole again... cannon balls rocketing backwards
     into the cannons' breech... Fallen come to their feet, to
     live and breathe again.

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.)
                  ... home to farm, to work, have
                  children, to live long, full
                  lives...

14   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         14

     Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat...

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  Perhaps, my own son might come
                  home again...

15   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, ANOTHER TIME     15

     And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life
     hopping backward off the train to land where his journey
     started... back in the arms of his loving parents...

                                                                  7.



16   INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                  16

                             MONSIEUR GATEAU
               I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I
               hope you enjoy my clock.

     And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the
     terminal and exits... The crowd is motionless. They look
     to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance... but he simply puts his
     hat on, and with his guardians, is gone...

                             DAISY'S (V.O.)
               Mr Cake was never seen again.
               Some say he died of a broken
               heart. Some say he went to sea...

17   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - AT THE END OF A DAY             17

     Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing... away...

18   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT           18

                             DAISY
               He just rowed...rowed...away...

     The wind loudly rattles the window...they turn to look...

                              DOROTHY BAKER
               Do you mind if I make myself a
               call? I've got somebody watching
               my little boy.

                             CAROLINE
               No, please go call...

     It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying
     mother... with the wind knocking at the window... After
     some moments:

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               I hope I haven't disappointed you,
               Mother.

                              DAISY
               Oh honey, you could never
               disappoint me.

                             CAROLINE
               I wished I had more to show for
               myself. I know you would have
               liked to have had grandchildren.

                  normal...

     As if to say the pieces haven't all fit... trying to
     articulate it...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  I'm either a step ahead... or a

                  What's normal?     A hat full of
                  sand.

                                   CAROLINE
                  What?

                       (going on)
                  I need my brown suitcase... The

                                   CAROLINE
                  An envelope?

     Caroline doing what she's asked goes over to one of the
     suitcases by the bed... She opens it... and among the
     clothes and the keepsakes, there is indeed an old
     envelope.

                  This one?

                                DAISY
                  I tried to read it a hundred
                  different times... but I couldn't
                  bring myself...

                                CAROLINE
                  What do you mean?

                                   DAISY
                  Read it to me.

     Daisy closes her eyes... Caroline takes out a sheath of
     papers... It's a journal of some kind written in
     longhand... Pages have come undone... scraps of paper,
     even some napkins...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                       (murmurs)
                  Just the sound of your voice...

     And for her mother's sake she begins to read it... with
     no particular interest, like reading to someone a
     selection from a menu's choices...

                             CAROLINE
               It's dated "April 4, 1985." It
               says, "New Orleans."
                    (after a beat)
               "This is my last will and
               testament...
                    (which starts to
                     engage her)
               I don't have much to leave... few
               possessions, no money really... I
               will go out of this world the same
               way I came in, alone and with
               nothing.
                    (finding herself
                     engaged)
               All I have is my story... I'm
               writing it now while I still
               remember it..."

     She's interested. She looks over at her mother.    But her
     mother's eyes are closed...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "My name is Benjamin..."

     And Caroline's voice becomes a young MAN'S voice...

                             A MAN'S (V.O.)
               "Benjamin Button... and I was born
               under unusual circumstances."

19   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                                19

     THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               The war to end all wars had ended.

     We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with
     drunken, singing revelers... cars jamming the
     cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful... Another
     burst of fireworks.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I was told it was an especially
               good night to be born...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                9A.

19   CONTINUED:                                                 19

     And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his
     early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a
     fashionable town home. He nearly collides with a PRIEST
     who arrives there at the same time. Thomas runs past
     him, up the steps...

20   INT. BUTTON HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                20

     ...He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase...
     barging into the MASTER BEDROOM...

                                                                    10.



21   INT. MASTER BEDROOM, BUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 1918                 21

     ... where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed,
     frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the
     help of the small domestic staff... the PRIEST enters...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
                    (seeing him)
               Why are you here?

                             THE DOCTOR
               Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going
               to survive...

     And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty
     young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets,
     futilely start to change her bloody linens...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
               That's enough...! All of you!

     They move out of the way... and Thomas kneels beside his
     wife... She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes...
     He takes her hand...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               I came as quickly as I could...
               I'm sorry I took so long, the
               streets are filled with people...

     As if to underscore it, fireworks go off...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               You are going to be alright, my
               dearest darling... I will not let
               anything happen to you...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE
               Promise me, Thomas...

     And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY.    But
     Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONT'D)
               Promise me, he has a place...

     He doesn't understand... She looks up at him... holds his
     hand tight... then she slips away... The Doctor listening
     for her pulse... He covers her... it's quiet... the
     Priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids
     crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 11.

21   CONTINUED:                                                  21

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  She gave her life for me... And
                  for that I am forever grateful...

     Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go...
     When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is
     not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor,
     or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a
     deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all
     turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY
     continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to
     answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick
     blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to
     lift it, to see his son's face...

                                   MAID
                  Mr. Button...!

     He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has
     seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of
     sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh." And then he suddenly
     snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of
     the room... downstairs... outside...

22   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                              22

     ... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY,
     through the streets... Pushing through crowds...

23   EXT. A BRIDGE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                    23

     ... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the
     air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark...
     brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the
     black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when,
     despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it...
     Instead, cradles the newborn...

                                THOMAS
                  I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

     A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way...

                                POLICEMAN
                  What are you doing there!?

     The BABY starts to CRY...

                                POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                  What do you have there?

     Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas,
     carrying the CRYING BABY, running...

                                                                  12.



23A   EXT. NEW ORLEANS, GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1918             23A

      Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow
      streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the
      large old moldering antebellum houses...

24    EXT. THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918     24

      He comes to an old three-story house with a screened
      porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and
      LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light,
      by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops
      its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath...
      He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of
      VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
      porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has,
      tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can
      just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
      Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his
      decision made, he turns, moving away from the house,
      leaving his child behind.

                              A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                I could've sworn I heard somebody
                knockin'...

      When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto
      the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s,
      with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as
      QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR.
      WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the
      door, and not seeing anything...

                                 QUEENIE
                I guess not...

      She stands for a moment taking in the night air...

                              QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                The air smells sweet...

      And she sings to herself... a song from the time...

                              TIZZY
                You look very handsome tonight,
                Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever
                seen you... The green matches
                your eyes...

                              QUEENIE
                     (fingering dress)
                It isn't everyday a war's over,
                Mr. Weathers...
                              (MORE)
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                     13.

24   CONTINUED:                                                      24
                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have to mark it somehow... You
                  ain't no slouch yourself.

     He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert's back in town... came
                  home legless, but he home... we're
                  gonna throw a party for him...
                  help get himself situated...
                       (beat)
                  I know you was sweet on him one
                  time...

                                QUEENIE
                  Sweeter than I shoulda been...
                  Lost his legs you say? "You never
                  know what's comin' for you."

     And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head
     out...

                                OLD WOMAN
                  Ms. Simone messed herself...

                                QUEENIE
                  She got to stop doing that, or
                  it's diapers for her... I'll be
                  right there, Mrs. Jameson...

     The woman disappears inside.    Queenie, not anxious to
     go...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  It sure is nice out here, Mr.
                  Weathers...

                                TIZZY
                  Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come
                  out back for a moment... take your
                  mind away from things...

     He pushes open the porch screen door...

                                QUEENIE
                       (smiles)
                  Just a moment's time...

     He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of
     the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right
     on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles,
     nearly falls...


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 14.

                             TIZZY
               What in God's name...?!!

                                QUEENIE
               What is that?     A fish crawl out of
               the river...?

     She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               God in heaven!

     IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we
     see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it
     has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an
     octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it
     would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed
     old man...

                             QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               My Goodness, the Lord did
               something here...!

                             TIZZY
               Look like a milk wagon run over
               it... three times... and back...

     And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I didn't see it layin' there... I
               hope I didn't hurt it none...
               steppin' on it like that...

     The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               We best leave it to the police...
               I'll go --

     Queenie hesitates... a longing.

                             QUEENIE
               It's for sure nobody wanted to
               keep it...

     And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying
     baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering
     something, going in after her...

                                                                  15.



25   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918              25

     A piano's playing a standard, people singing.... There's
     a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and
     carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of
     those who have lived and died here over many years... and
     we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to
     ninety-five, in various stages of health... various
     contraptions to keep them "afloat". An Old Age Home. We
     see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the
     crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her,
     still anxiously whispering after her...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Where are you, Queenie...?

                             QUEENIE
               Hold your water...
                    (and to Tizzy)
               Go see to them.

     He does what she asks. She hurries the baby into a small
     room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...

26   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM, OLD HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918     26

     A small room tucked under the staircase...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Queenie Apple... she went and
               messed herself all over again...

                             QUEENIE
               Jane Childress start her a bath...
               and mind your business, Mrs.
               Duprey... You'll be messing
               yourself soon enough too!

     There's a KNOCK on Queenie's door.

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                    (whispers)
               Somebody stole my necklace...

                             QUEENIE
               I'll be right with you, Mrs.
               Hollister...

     She whispers to The Baby, soothing it. And looking for a
     place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                16.

26   CONTINUED:                                                 26

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  You may be as ugly as an old
                  pot... but you still a child of
                  God...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Queenie, Apple... she won't go
                  take a bath wit'out you...

                                QUEENIE
                  Mercy, I'll be right there.

     And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser
     drawer... with her unmentionables... and shuts it...
     leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe...
     Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost,
     looking in the room...

                                MRS. HOLLISTER
                  My sister gave those pearls to
                  me... I can't find them
                  anywhere... People are stealing my
                  jewelry...!

                                 QUEENIE
                  They're right here, Mrs.
                  Hollister, right 'round your
                  pretty white neck...
                       (moving her)
                  Come on now...

     There's a sound of a door chime...

                                A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                  Dr. Rose has arrived for his
                  visit...

     Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby, and
     closes the door... And we stay behind for a moment...
     inside Queenie's underwear drawer, with the smell of a
     lilac sachet... is the Baby with the face of an old
     man... looking up at the sliver of light coming into the
     dresser drawer...

27   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918        27

     We see the Doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has
     done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing
     examining one of the elderly boarders. He puts his
     things into his doctor's bag. Queenie comes beside him,
     saying something...

                                                                  17.



28   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT, 1918                       28

     The Baby is lying on Queenie's bed... Dr. Rose,
     stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink.

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               ... He's nearly blind from
               cataracts... I'm not sure he can
               hear... His bones indicate severe
               arthritis... His skin has lost all
               elasticity... His hands and feet
               are ossified... He has all the
               deterioration, the infirmities,
               not of a newborn, but of a man
               well in his eighties on the way to
               his grave...

                             QUEENIE
               You mean to say he's dying?

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               Of old age. His body is failing
               him before his life's begun.

     They're still, looking at the strange baby.

                             DOCTOR ROSE (CONT'D)
               Where did he come from?

                             QUEENIE
                    (after a beat)
               It's my sister's child... From
               Lafayette. She had an unfortunate
               adventure.
                    (whispers)
               The poor child got the worse of
               it... came out white...

                             DOCTOR ROSE
               There are places for 'unwanted'
               babies like these, Queenie...
               There's no room for another mouth
               to feed here... The Nolan
               Foundation, despite their good
               intentions, thinks this place is a
               large nuisance as it is... A baby
               here --

                             QUEENIE
                    (appealing)
               You said he don't have long.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                     18.

                                DOCTOR ROSE
                  Queenie -- some creatures aren't
                  meant to survive.

     She looks at the Baby, determined.

                                QUEENIE
                  He is a miracle, that's for
                  certain... just not the kind of
                  miracle one hopes to see...

29   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1918                     29

     The Old People are sitting around the parlor talking,
     playing cards... Queenie brings the baby bundle into the
     room.

                                QUEENIE
                  You all listen...

     And they stop what they are doing...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have a visitor that will be
                  staying with us for a little
                  while... My sister had a child but
                  couldn't see right by it... He's
                  known as...
                       (a hesitation naming him)
                  Benjamin...
                       (she likes the sound
                        of it)
                  Benjamin... He's not a well
                  child... so we need to take very
                  good care of him...

     We see Tizzy's come out of the kitchen , watching with an
     air of strong disapproval... And an OLD WOMAN says...

                                ONE OF THE WOMEN
                  I had ten children... there's not
                  a baby I can't care for... let me
                  see him...

     Queenie hesitates, and gives the Baby to her... The Old
     Woman pushes the blanket back from the baby's face...

                                THE OLD WOMAN
                       (startled)
                  God in heaven, he looks just like
                  my ex-husband...

     And there's laughter...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 19.

29   CONTINUED:                                                  29

                                QUEENIE
                  He's prematurely old... Doctor
                  Rose said he don't have much time
                  on this earth...

                                   A MAN
                  Join the club.

     They all laugh. Their laughter makes the baby seem to
     smile... the lonely smile of an old, dying man.

30   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT, 1918          30

     We see Queenie, unable to sleep, lying in bed, looking
     out a small window... there's a light KNOCK on the
     door... Tizzy...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert sends his remembrance to
                  you.

     She nods... The baby cries out... and then it's quiet...

                                TIZZY (CONT'D)
                       (meaning the baby)
                  Are you right out of your mind? I
                  know you don't got all the parts
                  it takes to make one of your
                  own... but this isn't yours to
                  keep... this isn't even human
                  kind...

     With nothing left to be said, he starts to go...

                                QUEENIE
                       (whispers)
                  Mr. Weathers. Stay with me
                  tonight.

     He slows.    She's quiet.     And she whispers:

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  "You never know what's comin' for
                  you."

     And as they move to be with one another, to make love; we
     look over at the dresser drawer -- open just a crack...
     Benjamin lying among the unmentionables, looking out at
     the world...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I found a home...

                                                                  20.



31   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           31

     Caroline with the "journal" on her knees. Daisy, eyes
     closed... the wind gathered in strength... furiously
     knocking...

                             CAROLINE
               Is any of this true?

                             DAISY
               You have such a lovely voice.

     Caroline shrugs.   She looks through the "book..."

                             CAROLINE
               Some pages seem to be torn out
               here...

     She discovers inside...

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               There's an old streetcar token.

     She gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it.
     But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window...

                             DAISY
               That clock... Just kept going,
               year after year after year...

32   INT. "NEW" TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1925    32

     And we see "Mr. Cake's" clock with its cherubs pushing
     the "hands of progress," still marking time backwards...
     The year is now, "1925..."

33   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM, NEW ORLEANS -            33
     EVENING, 1925

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               "...I didn't know I was a child.
               I thought I was like everyone else
               who lived there, an old man, in my
               "golden years."

     The boarders eating dinner. Queenie, in a white
     uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and
     apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient
     faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing
     eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come
     to know... the face of a very old man...



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                 21.

33   CONTINUED:                                                  33

     The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a
     six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small,
     shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with
     arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a
     hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one
     ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are
     sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the
     last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we
     watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might,
     banging it just for the hell of it making noise...

                                QUEENIE
                  Stop bangin' that fork...
                       (fixing it in his
                        arthritic hand)
                  It's for eating, not for playin'
                  with... And use your napkin,
                  please Mr. Benjamin...

     And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of
     the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man
     having dinner with his contemporaries.

34   EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925      34

     A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six-
     year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between
     them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough,
     sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making
     him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the
     other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking...
     Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children
     playing... people talking...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON
                  What's there?

     Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally
     curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself
     precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall
     is lower and he just sees the street... children running
     on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off
     for a party... He leans forward to get an even better
     view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...

                                QUEENIE
                  Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come
                  back here...!

     ...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the
     safety of the old people... out of sight of the street...

                                                                  22.



35   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925                            35

     The small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in
     a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I loved her very much. She was my
               mother.

     And he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes
     his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie
     in bed, her "son", the "old man" on the floor...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               Somedays I feel like I'm different
               from the day before...

                             QUEENIE
               Everybody feels different about
               themselves one way or another.
               We're all goin' the same way, just
               taking different roads to get
               there... You're on your own road,
               Benjamin.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON
               How much longer do I have to live,
               Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               Just be thankful you got what
               you're given. You already here
               longer than you supposed to be.

     We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Some nights, I would have to sleep
               alone.

     He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying
     him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy
     going back down into the room to be with Queenie...
     shutting the door...

36   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925            36

     An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a
     book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his
     wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house.

                  I didn't mind. I would listen to
                  the house breathing. All the
                  people sleeping. I felt safe.

     Be he still wants to know "What's over there?" He wheels
     himself over to sit at the window looking outside...
     looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate...
     trying to see what's dangerous...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  It was a place of great routine...
                  Every morning at 5:30, no matter
                  the weather... General Winslow,
                  U.S. Army Retired... raised the
                  flag...

37   EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                  37

     And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just
     that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's
     naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with
     a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING
     OPERA...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)
                  Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted
                  opera singer... well, she'd sing,
                  Wagner...

38   INT. MRS. WAGNER'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925              38

     We see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown
     at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the
     top of her lungs... while, down the hall we see Queenie
     giving Benjamin a bath... massaging his poor crippled
     legs...

                                 QUEENIE
                  We're gonna put some life into
                  these old sticks for you... get
                  you walkin'...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  Breakfast was served promptly at
                  six.

39   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                     39

     We see Benjamin in his wheelchair, under Tizzy's
     tutelage, learning to cook... and simultaneously, to
     read...

     Some staff come in getting platters of food...

     Tizzy smacks the back of his head.

40   INT. KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1925                      40

     Tizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him...
     putting away cans... reading from one of the labels...

                             BENJAMIN
               Tomato, brown sugar, salt,
               myasses...

     Tizzy swats at him with his dish towel...

                               TIZZY
               "Molasses"...

     And while washing the dishes...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I learned to read when I was five.
               My grandfather was a dresser for a
               famous actor. He'd bring home
               every play for me to read.
                    (Shakespeare)
               "Kind keepers of my weak decaying
               age, Let dying Mortimer here rest
               himself. Even like a man new
               haled from the rack. So fare my
               limbs with long imprisonment. And
               these gray locks, the pursuivants
               of death, Nestor-like aged in an
               age of care, Argue the end of
               Edmund Mortimer."

     Benjamin's mouth agape, awed, taken by him, his majesty.

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               You thought I was plain ignorant,
               didn't you?

     Benjamin never thought about it...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               The actor my grandfather worked
               for was John Wilkes Booth. He
               killed Abraham Lincoln. You never
               know...

     An old man looks in...

                             A MAN
               When's dessert...?

                  When it's served. Now sit your
                  wrinkly butt back down, Mr. Lee.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  On Saturday nights I would go to
                  Queenie's church...

41   INT. CHURCH TENT, NEW ORLEANS - A SATURDAY NIGHT, 1926           41

     A sweltering shout 'em up Negro gospel tent. Queenie
     pushes Benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people
     looking to be healed, bringing him face to face with a
     mountain of a PREACHER, pouring sweat and full of fire...

                                THE PREACHER
                  What can I do for you, Sister?

     And Queenie whispers something to him.

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Her parts are all twisted up
                  inside so she can't have little
                  children...

     He puts his hand on her stomach...

                                PREACHER
                  Lord, if you could see clear to
                  forgive this woman her sins so she
                  can bear the fruit of the womb.
                       (and shouts)
                  Out damnable affliction!

     He presses on her stomach... making Queenie nearly fall
     over... held up by a "NURSE" in a crisp white uniform.
     And once she's regained her balance...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (at Benjamin)
                  And what's this old man's
                  irrediction?

                                QUEENIE
                  He's got the devil on his back...
                  trying to ride him into the grave
                  before his time...

                                THE PREACHER
                       (touches Benjamin)
                  Out, Zebuchar! Out, Beelzebub!
                       (after a beat)
                  How old are you?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      27.

     And he says what is only true.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm seven, but I look a lot older.

                                   PREACHER
                       (laughs)
                  God bless you.    He's seven!

     The congregation laughs...

                                THE PREACHER
                  This is a man who has optimism in
                  his heart! Belief in his soul!
                  We are all children in the eyes of
                  God. Now we are going to get you
                  out of that chair... we're gonna
                  have you walk...
                       (his hands on Ben's
                        shoulders)
                  In the name of God's glory, rise
                  up!

     And Benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his
     legs akimbo, stands... The people all applaud...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Now God is going to see you the
                  rest of the way... He's going to
                  see this little old man walk
                  without the use of a crutch or a
                  cane...! He's going walk by
                  himself on faith and divine
                  inspiration alone...! We'll show
                  that Devil where to go...! Walk
                  on...!

     And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor
     arthritic legs give out... and he sprawls to the floor...
     The Aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but:

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Don't touch him!
                       (kneeling to Benjamin)
                  Rise up, old man!

     But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor... The Preacher
     comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him...

                                THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
                  Rise up like Lazarus!

     Benjamin still lies on the floor...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               I said rise up!!

     And Benjamin, slowly but surely, makes his way to his
     feet...

                             THE PREACHER (CONT'D)
               Yes, and say hallelujah!
                    (Hallelujah!)
               Now walk, my old friend...
               Walk on...!

     And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across
     the stage... The people urging him on... a string of
     "Hallelujahs...!" Queenie comes to join him... urging
     him...

                             QUEENIE
               Let the Lord carry you... ...

     ...The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance
     than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord... Queenie and
     The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage...
     Benjamin making it to the other end... to a roar of
     "Amens"!

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Now, when I look back on it, it
               was kind of miraculous... But you
               know the saying, "...the Lord
               Giveth and the Lord Taketh
               away..."

     ... That mountain of a Preacher... in full exaltation to
     God...

                             THE PREACHER
               Praise be to the Lord on the
               highest...!

     Suddenly pitches over, flat on his face... Having had a
     spontaneous coronary... lying center-stage, deader than
     the proverbial doornail... The crisp uniformed "nurses"
     running to attend to him, and poor "old" Benjamin
     haplessly looking around.

42   INT. THE PARLOR ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY 1926          42

     The people are gathered...

       A lit cake is being brought in celebrating General
       Winslow's birthday. He stares at the cake, unhappily
       gets up, mutters something... and leaves. The oldsters
       eye the cake, and without a moment's hesitation, dig
       in...

                    And mortality was a common visitor
                    to our house... People came and
                    went... Death was so frequent, I
                    was never afraid of it.

43     EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, ANOTHER MORNING, 1926                        43

                    You could hear when someone left

       A small funeral at   an old cemetery... And while "DIE
       VALKYRIE" PLAYS on   her crank VICTROLA, an old man bangs
       cymbals as a grand   finale to the music... while we see
       SYBIL WAGNER, laid   to rest to sing in another choir:

                    It was a wonderful place to grow
                    up. I was with people who had put
                    away all the inconsequences of
                    life, left in a state of purely
                    being...wondering about the
                    weather...the temperature of a
                    bath...the light at the end of the

47B   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY, 1927           47B

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                For everyone that died, someone
                would come to take their place...

      And we see Benjamin coming into the kitchen... Tizzy busy
      preparing lunch... Benjamin stops, seeing a tiny African
      man, his back to us, surrounded by old people standing on
      the lawn... He hears him telling them...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                ... My first wife and I are
                captured by neighbor tribe,
                cannibals...

      The old people shrink at the mention...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I escaped across the river...

                              AN OLD WOMAN
                     (wide eyed)
                You escaped cannibals?

                              NGUNDA OTI
                My wife, she can't swim, so she
                eaten.

                              TIZZY
                     (telling Benjamin)
                That's Mr. Oti... He's an
                acquaintance of an acquaintance of
                mine...he'll be stayin' with us in
                the staff quarters for awhile...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                     (telling old people)
                ...Second wife stepped on viper
                and dies... (jocular) It was bad
                luck to be married to Mr. Oti.

      They laugh.

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                I am captured with six others by
                Baschiele tribe. They sell us to a
                big white man...

      He instinctively turns and sees Benjamin standing in the
      window watching him. When Mr. Oti spots him he quickly
      moves out of the window out of sight.

                                                                   31.



47C   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME, 1927            47C

      We see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing
      with some metal army men... when Mr. Oti's distinctive
      laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs...
      Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... Mr. Oti,
      standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the
      help, telling them his life story... but it's a
      completely different tone... a mockery of white people
      and their insanity...

                              NGUNDA OTI
                The Big White Man brings us to St.
                Louis, where they make our village
                at the 1904 World's Fair... They
                have us livin' in these little
                huts like we're livin' in
                Africa... people behind bars
                staring at us... we told not to
                look at them... to just go about
                our normal lives... what the hell
                they talkin' about... ?

      They all laugh...

                              NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                At night we're done bein'
                "savages..." we go over the wall
                into The Rosebud... we drank and
                laughed until the sun come up...
                and then we savages again...

      They nod enjoying the idea... And as Mr. Oti senses
      Benjamin's presence, turning... Benjamin retreating on
      his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs...

47D   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1927            47D

      Benjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an
      oversized book of "Imaginary Beings..." He senses a
      presence... and Mr. Oti sits down across from him.

                              NGUNDA OTI
                I hear you not so old as you
                looking. You just foolin'
                everybody. What happen, you get
                Madjembe?




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's a madjembe?

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Worms.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't think so. This is just
                   how I am.

      Mr. Oti looks out at the street.

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   You want to get a cold root beer?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (an echo)
                   It's dangerous.

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Who said that?

      He gets up ready to go. Benjamin hesitates. He can see
      Queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a
      rug.

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                        (last chance)
                   ...Come on little man...

      Despite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes
      and follows Ngunda outside...

49    EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927       49

      They come outside. Children on the street playing.
      Seeing Benjamin, they come to a dead stop... staring at
      the freak from the old people's home, with another
      freak... Mr. Oti suddenly runs into the street...

                                    NGUNDA OTI
                   Hurry...

      Benjamin tries as best he can to keep up... Mr. Oti darts
      directly in front of a street car, waving his arms,
      making it come to an abrupt stop...




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                   ...Another white man come to my
                   country and say he want to talk to
                   me...

50    INT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927                 50

      We move along the aisle of a streetcar... the various
      people...

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   Then I am in the monkey house at
                   "Philadelphia Zoological Park."
                   Three thousand people show up my
                   first day...

      Benjamin and Ngunda siting in the back of the streetcar
      behind a moveable metal bar that has "Coloreds" painted
      on it... Mr. Oti taking a slug from a flask... A group of
      school children nearby can't take their eyes off the two
      of them... Mr. Oti takes his wallet out, taking out a
      folded piece of newspaper, showing it to Benjamin...
      "Bushman shares cage with park apes."

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What's it like living in a cage?

                                 NGUNDA OTI
                   It stinks. The monkeys, they do
                   some tricks... I throw spear... I
                   wrestle with Kowali, she is
                   orangutan... They have me file my
                   teeth like a cannibal...

      He shows him his teeth filed into points like a
      cannibal...

                                 NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                   When I'm not playing with monkeys -
                   - they want me to run to bars in
                   my cage with teeth to scare little
                   children...

      And he suddenly jumps up and does just that, charging
      with his teeth bared at the school children... They
      scream... Mr. Oti, taking his seat again, laughs with
      Benjamin...

50A   INT. (OR) EXT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY             50A

      Benjamin, ecstatic, his head out the streetcar window,
      Mr. Oti holding onto the back of his breeches from
      falling... Benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash
      over him...

                                                                 34.



51   EXT. THE PERISTYLE, NEW ORLEANS - PARK - END OF DAY, 1927   51

     Benjamin and Mr. Oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle
     of a park. Benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola,
     taking too big a hit, the coke pouring out of his nose...
     Mr. Oti gives him a handkerchief... after he's wiped
     himself up...

                             BENJAMIN
               Why didn't you go back home?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               War between English and Dutch
               people had broken up kingdom.

                             BENJAMIN
               What did you do?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I leave zoo. Go here. Go there.
               Everything okay. But I alone.

                             BENJAMIN
               You were all alone?

                             NGUNDA OTI
               You'll see little man, plenty
               times you be alone. You different
               like us, it's gonna be that way.
               But I tell you a little secret I
               find out. We know we alone. Fat
               people, skinny people, tall
               people, white people... they just
               as alone as us... But they scared
               shitless...

     He smiles a knowing smile...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               Not a thing wrong with being
               alone... no sir...

     He looks out...

                             NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
               I think about the river I grew up
               on. It would be good to sit by my
               river again.

     He looks at his watch.   He suddenly gets up...

                                                                 34A.



52   EXT. BOURBON STREET CORNER, NEW ORLEANS - DUSK, 1927         52

     Mr. Oti and Benjamin coming along the street, music
     pouring out... They reach a corner where a tall octoroon
     woman is waiting. She broadly smiles seeing Mr. Oti.

                             THE WOMAN
               There's my little man. You ready,
               sugar.

                  Always ready. Always ready.
                       (introduces)
                  Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

                                FILAMENA GILEA
                       (respectful of his
                        age)
                  It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                       (to Benjamin)
                  You can find your own way home,
                  can't you?

     Although he's not sure he can... he nods, yes.

                                NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D)
                  The St. Charles Avenue line to
                  Napoleon...

     And with that, his arm around Filamena's waist, the two
     of them laughing, walk off... Benjamin's left standing on
     the street corner... he looks around to get his
     bearings... he moves along Bourbon Street... A streetcar
     comes along, bell clanging, it rushes by him... he
     watches it go... Clasping his canes, determined, he
     starts walking... bent over, one cane after the other...
     making his way along the street...

53   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1927                53

     We see Benjamin coming back to the gate... and we hear:

                                QUEENIE (V.O.)
                  Where in God's name have you
                  been?!!

     And we see Queenie standing on the porch... She's worried
     sick... she sees his hands are bleeding from blisters.

54   INT. KITCHEN, QUEENIE'S SINK, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT               54

     Queenie cleaning his hands...

                                QUEENIE
                  Like to scare the Holy Hell out of
                  me! I was so worried about

55   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              55

     And the "caregiver," Dorothy Baker, comes back in.        She
     feels Daisy's pulse, straightens her pillow...

                                DOROTHY BAKER

     Dorothy nods.

                       (after a beat)
                  They're sayin' it's gonna reach us
                  late in the day... I'm goin' to
                  get my baby and take him to my
                  sister's... they said there's
                  nothin' to worry about here in the
                  hospital...Nurses are right here
                  if you need them...I'll see you in
                  about an hour if that'll be
                  okay...

                                CAROLINE
                  No, that's fine...please...

     She leaves. It's momentarily quiet, the wind knocking at
     the window... Daisy, ruminating...

                                DAISY
                  Was there just company?

                                CAROLINE
                  Dorothy had to go home...

     But Daisy's mind is elsewhere...gesturing for her to keep
     reading...

                                DAISY
                  Caroline...

     Caroline looks back at the book.       Daisy closes her

                  come and visit...

56   EXT. THE LAWN, THE NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1930                   56

     The boarders on the lawn with their loved ones... And we          *
     see an OLD MAN, walking with the aid of a cane coming out         *
     of the house onto the lawn... And as he moves through the         *
     people we see it's Benjamin... He has a single cane,              *
     standing more upright now, a distinctive shock of white
     hair, eyebrows... A distinguished looking man in his              *
     seventies, or, in normal years, a growing twelve-year-old
     boy...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met
               the person who changed my life
               forever.

     A chauffeured car has stopped... A Man is standing in the
     road, looking at the house through the gates... And we
     realize it's THOMAS BUTTON... looking for a glimpse of
     his son... Benjamin instinctively turns, but it's too
     late, his father's back in the car, being driven away...

                  Well, Benjamin...                                        *

     Benjamin, and Grandma Fuller turn to see a little girl,               *
     no more than eight, standing on a picnic table top doing              *
     pirouettes, one after another, for an admiring group of               *
     old people...she full curtsies, bowing --the way dancers              *
     do head to chest... then raising her head, laughing...                *

57   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THANKSGIVING, 1930           57

     The families, along with Ngunda and Filamena, are
     gathered in the dining room, their heads bowed in prayer.
     We see Daisy across from Benjamin... The prayer's
     finished, it's noisy...

                             NGUNDA OTI
               We pray to Bembe... the creator of
               all living things... she retired
               after all that work...

                             DAISY
                    (needing to top that)
               Did you know turkeys aren't really
               birds...?

                             BENJAMIN
               Why do you say that?

                             DAISY
               They're in the pheasant family.
               They can hardly fly. It's sad
               don't you think? A bird, that
               can't fly.

                             NGUNDA OTI
               I like birds that can't fly.
               They're easy to eat.

                             QUEENIE
                    (standing)
               I have something to tell you
               all...

     They're quiet.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  While we're giving thanks for
                  God's blessings... I've had a
                  miracle happen.
                       (she touches her
                        stomach)
                  The Lord saw fit to answer my
                  prayers.

     The people applaud the good news.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What does she mean "answered her
                  prayers?"

                                DAISY
                  She's going to have a baby, silly.
                  That's what my mother said when I
                  was going to have a little
                  brother. He didn't live long
                  though. He didn't breathe
                  right...

     And we can see Benjamin's heart beginning to break... he
     looks over, Tizzy, proudly smiling... And as Queenie
     accepts congratulations... Benjamin's old wrinkled face,
     watching her... looks like he's going to cry...

58   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1930                    58

     We see an ABSTRACT BLACK AND WHITE DRAWING.       And we hear
     a woman's voice...

     AN OLD FINGER comes in pointing to a drawing. We see                  *
     Benjamin and Daisy, sitting close together on a sofa, and             *
     Daisy's grandmother, arm encircling them, is reading to               *

                  o'clock, because Big God Ngog's                   *

59   INT. A ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT, 1930                 59

     We see Benjamin asleep in bed with one of the Old Men,
     MR. DAWS. The door opens. And Daisy, in her nightgown,
     has come inside... she slightly touches Benjamin...

                             DAISY
                    (whispers)
               Are you sleeping?

     He shakes "no."

                    (whispers)
               Come on...

     She moves quickly out of the room and Benjamin gets up,
     and with the aid of his cane, follows her...

60   INT. BACK STAIRWELL, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930            60

     The old house still. Daisy, moving quietly down the
     stairs. Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps,
     following her.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (whispers)
               Where are we going?

     She doesn't say anything. She leads him into the DINING
     ROOM... where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and
     pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and
     a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry...

                               DAISY
               Under here...

     And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table...
     Benjamin follows her into the "fort..."

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
               Nobody knows about this but us.

     They sit... The little girl, and the old man with the
     maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret
     lair... She takes a candle out of the folds of her
     nightgown... She tries to light it, but doesn't really
     know how to use matches...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Will you light it?

                  Don't be chicken...

     Despite his caution, he lights the candle... the
     candlelight making it feel more secret...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                  I'll tell you a secret then you
                  tell me one...
                       (whispers)
                  I saw mommy kissing another man.
                  Her face was red from it.

     Benjamin doesn't know what to say.

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Your turn to tell.

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm younger than I look.

                                DAISY
                       (whispers)
                  You don't seem like an old
                  person... like my grandma... Are
                  you sick?

                                BENJAMIN
                       (whispers)
                  I heard Tizzy and my mother
                  whisper. They said I was going to
                  die soon.
                       (smiles)
                  But I fooled them so far.

     Daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight.

                  You are different than anybody I
                  have ever met. Can I?


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                  43.

     She innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to
     see what it feels like... When suddenly a sheet is pulled
     back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there.

                             GRANDMA FULLER
               What are you doing under there?
               Who's idea was this candle?

     She angrily blows it out... and... to Daisy... taking her
     by the arm...

                             GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D)
               It's after midnight, you come
               right out here and get back up to
               bed...!
                    (and for Benjamin,
                     but saying it to
                     Daisy)
               You are not to be playing
               together! Play with people your
               own age...!
                    (moving her along)
               Now, you come back to bed, young
               lady...! You're too young to be
               wandering around in the night by
               yourself...
                    (and a last word to
                     Benjamin)
               You should be ashamed of yourself!

     And they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the
     sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in
     her nightgown, standing in the doorway...

                             QUEENIE
               You are a different child... a man
               child. People aren't going to
               understand how different you are.

                             BENJAMIN
                    (forlorn)
               What's wrong with me, Mother?

                             QUEENIE
               God hasn't said yet. Now, back to
               bed and behave yourself.

     He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane,
     and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the
     back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask.
     He looks at Benjamin as he goes by.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                  44.

                             NGUNDA OTI
                    (takes a drink)
               You get used to it...

                             QUEENIE (V.O.)
                    (shouts)
               You get back in that bed or I'll
               cane your old ass!

     Benjamin turns down the hallway and slips into the
     bedroom --

61   INT. BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930                 61

     Benjamin climbing back into bed with the Old Man.
     Turning his back to the old man. And Mr. Daws, unable to
     sleep...

                             MR. DAWS
               Did I ever tell you I've been
               struck by lightning seven times.
               Once, when I was fixing a leak on
               the roof.

     And we see just that, the old man on a roof getting
     blasted.

                             MR. DAWS (CONT'D)
               Once, when I was crossing the road
               to get the mail...

     And we see that, the man peacefully crossing a country
     road to get the mail, getting hit by lightning... But
     Benjamin just lays there looking out the window... all he
     can think about... despite everything...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I never forgot her blue eyes...

62   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           62

     The words linger. Daisy, her extraordinary blue eyes,
     lying on her death bed... the rattle of the window in the
     wind...

                             CAROLINE
               Are you alright, Mother?

     She nods "yes."

                  This man. He loved you from the
                  first time he saw you.

     She doesn't say anything.

                                CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                       (without complaint)
                  Nobody has ever loved me that way.

                                DAISY
                       (impelling her)
                  Go on.

                                CAROLINE
                  He crossed out something... and
                  then he's written... "When..."

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  "...When the baby came things were
                  different..."

63   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                     63

     We see Benjamin in his pajamas, quietly coming into the
     kitchen for something to eat... And he slows, seeing
     Queenie, taking a moment to herself, sitting at the
     kitchen table, peacefully breast-feeding her infant... as
     Benjamin slips back out unseen, closing the door after
     him...

64   INT. ATTIC, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1931                           64

     We see Benjamin lying on a small bed in the ATTIC...
     cluttered with years of accumulated things...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I moved into my own room in the
                  attic... I realized, despite a
                  house filled with people that I
                  loved, I was alone...

     There's a noise. And we see Ngunda Oti is at the door, a
     suitcase in hand.

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I come to say goodbye. I'm going
                  away.

                                 BENJAMIN
                  Going away?   Where?



                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  I don't figure that out yet. I
                  will send you a postcard when I
                  get to there.

                                BENJAMIN
                  What about your friend?   The tall
                  lady?

                                NGUNDA OTI
                  We're not friends anymore. That's
                  what happens with tall people.

     He starts to go...

                                BENJAMIN
                  Goodbye...

     And he's gone.   Benjamin gets up going to the window.
     He looks outside. He can see Mr. Oti come onto the
     porch. There's a full moon. And as he walks off, his
     arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the
     gate, Benjamin watches him disappear into the night.

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I spent a lot of time by myself
                  that year...

65   INT. FRONT ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1931                  65

     Benjamin sitting at a table, an old man to look at but no
     more than twelve, busy playing with magnets...

                                BENJAMIN (V.O)
                  Until...

     We see a refined, genteel OLD WOMAN, wearing a hat and
     gloves, a suitcase at her feet, flanked by an old DOG,
     just inside the front door...

                                BENJAMIN               (CONT'D)
                  Hello...

                                THE WOMAN
                  I'm moving in today.

     And just then Queenie appears, the baby on her hip...

                                QUEENIE
                  Welcome... we was expecting you...
                       (to Benjamin)
                  Could you show her upstairs?
                                (MORE)

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  She will be staying in Mrs.
                  Rousseau's old room. I'll be
                  right with you with some fresh
                  towels...
                       (frowning)
                  We don't usually let dogs in the
                  house.

                                THE WOMAN
                  He's as old as the hills. Blind
                  too. Can hardly get around, he
                  won't be a bother much longer.

     Benjamin, like any young boy, immediately pets the old
     dog...

                                QUEENIE
                  I guess as long as he stays out
                  from underfoot.

     Benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the
     stairs...the old dog dutifully following them...

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'm Benjamin...

     The woman starts to tell him her name... but we don't
     hear it because...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                       (after a beat)
                  As hard as I try, I can't remember
                  her name. Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs.
                  Hartford, or maybe it was Maple?
                  It's funny how sometimes the
                  people we remember the least, make
                  the greatest impression on us.

66   INT. THE OLDER WOMAN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1931     66

     Benjamin sits petting the dog while the Woman puts her
     things away...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I remember she wore diamonds...
                  and she always dressed in fine
                  clothing as if she was going out.
                  Although, she never did and nobody
                  would ever come to visit her.

                                                                    48.



67   INT. NOLAN HOUSE, PARLOR - VISITING DAY, 1931                  67

     We see the Woman dressed nicely, sitting in a chair
     reading a book. She takes a look out the window at the
     families on the lawn and bends back to her book.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               ...She taught me how to play the
               piano...

68   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1932                 68

     The Woman sitting with Benjamin teaching him how to play
     piano...playing a classical piece like Chopin...Benjamin
     trying his hand...sounding pretty bad...

                             THE WOMAN
               It isn't how well you play, it's
               how you feel about what you're
               playing. (whispers) Try this.

     And she plays a ragtime piece...New Orleans music...music
     for the other whole part of the soul... Benjamin tries
     his hand and actually plays it fairly well

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               You cannot help but put your
               entire self into the music.

     And he plays along with her...a piece he won't soon
     forget...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               There were many changes going on,
               some you could see... some you
               couldn't.

69   INT. A BATHROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1932                     69

     We see Benjamin taking a bath. An he notices a single
     gray hair floating on the surface...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               Hair, had started growing, in all
               sorts of places...

     And he sees some hair is under his arms... and as he
     looks downward...

                  I felt like I could do anything,
                  that I could sprout wings...

     And as he flexes his muscles, feeling like a man.

70   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT                  70

     It's started to rain, the wind blowing, splattering rain
     against the window. Knocking.

                                DAISY
                  Oh, darlin', the pain...

                                CAROLINE
                  I'll get the nurse...

     She hurries out of the room. Daisy looks out the window.
     The maelstrom of wind and rain. Caroline comes back with
     a Nurse.

                                THE NURSE
                  You're not feeling too good?

     She adjusts the morphine drip.      Daisy lays back.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  Nobody seems to know whether to
                  stay or leave. The roads are
                  filled from New Orleans to Baton
                  Rouge already. I think I'm gonna
                  ride it out.
                       (finishing with the
                        drip)
                  There, that should make things
                  easier.

     Daisy starts to feel the effects of the drip...

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                       (to Caroline)
                  Have you had a chance to say your
                  goodbyes?

     Caroline nods.    The Nurse nods.

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  My father waited four hours for my
                  brother to get here from Boger

                                THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                  She seems like a sweet woman.

     Caroline nods.

                  I haven't spent as much time as I
                  would have like with her the last
                  few years.

     Another NURSE looks in...

                                THE WOMAN
                  You busy?

     The Nurse quickly   goes out of the room. Caroline sits
     back down looking   at her mother...Daisy opens her eyes...
     they look at each   other... Caroline knowing Daisy wants
     to hear the sound   of her voice...

     The busy docks... Men waiting, hoping to find work...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               These were hard times... people
               were doing anything they could to
               find work...

     And we see Benjamin, with Mr. Daws, "the lightning man,"
     sitting on a bench with a line of other old men, "killing
     time," watching the boats going up and down the River...

                             MR. DAWS
               Did I ever tell you I was struck
               by lightning seven times? Once,
               when I was in a field tending to
               my cows.

     And we see just that, Mr. Daws, along with a cow of his,
     being hit by lightning.

               Anybody want to make $2 for a
               day's work around here...

     Benjamin turns... And he sees a man in his late 40s with
     his three man crew, standing on the deck of a TUGBOAT,
     and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron... The man,
     its Captain MIKE... Has a thick Irish accent... For some
     reason none of the able-bodied men needing work
     respond...

               What's wrong, nobody wants to get

     Benjamin suddenly springs up at the opportunity, waving
     his arms...

     And as Benjamin gets on the boat, heading out to sea...

72   EXT. TUGBOAT, MISSISSIPPI RIVER, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1932       72

     And we see Benjamin "learning the ropes..." Helping to
     tow the freighters, into and out of the River ports...
     Benjamin in this element, like a boy, his hair blowing,
     thrilled to be on the boat, thrilled by the adventure...
     willing to do anything...

                  "What the hell you think you can
                  do?" I tell him. "Well if you
                  askin' -- I want to be a artist."
                  He laughs. He says, "If God
                  wanted you to be an artist he
                  would made you one." "God wanted
                  you to work a tugboat just like
                  me, and that's what you goin' to
                  do?" "Now, if I ever hear you
                  mention art again, I'll throw you
                  overboard!" Well, I went and I
                  show him... I made myself an
                  artist...

     And he suddenly takes off his shirt, pulls down his

               education..."

75   INT. WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1932    75

     Captain Mike and Benjamin in a small parlor where girls,
     both black and white, are sitting around...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               It was a night to remember...

     Captain Mike knows just who he wants and moves off with
     her... Benjamin left standing, not knowing what to do...
     None of the women seem to anxious to be with the old
     man...

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                     56.

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN
                   He gives me the willies...

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN (CONT'D)
                   He's not for me, no ways...

      A thin Girl, maybe 19, of mixed ethnicity, decides to
      take a chance...

                                 THE GIRL
                   How are you tonight, Grandpa?

76    INT. A ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932         76

      And we see Benjamin and the girl sitting on a bed... And
      as she undresses him... First things first... tossing him
      a wash cloth...

                                 THE GIRL
                   Clean yourself up...

      He doesn't know what she means.. Taking the wash cloth he
      goes over to the sink and does what he knows how to do,
      wash his face...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Is that any better?

76A   INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932       76A

      She's pushing him down, hiking up her skirt, all
      business...

                                 THE GIRL
                   Let's go... Time's a wastin'...

      She climbs on top of him... And instinct takes over...
      But Benjamin being just a boy... and this being the first
      time, his excitement gets the immediate best of him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Ohhh...!

                                 THE GIRL
                        (hopping up)
                   Come by anytime...

      She starts to leave... But Benjamin, who likes this an
      awful lot...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Again?


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                    57.

                                  THE GIRL
                   Again?

      She looks and sees, sure enough... She climbs back
      on...the results are virtually the same if a bit longer

                                 THE GIRL (CONT'D)
                   My hat's off to you old timer.

      She gets up to go...she's made it to the door... when
      Benjamin says...

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Again?

                                  THE GIRL
                   Again?

      She slows, turns to look... And sure enough... He's as
      ready as he's ever going to be... As she looks at him, a
      look bordering on amazement...

77    INT. THE ROOM, WHORE HOUSE, FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT, 1932      77

                                 THE GIRL
                   What are you, Dick Tracy or
                   something? I've got to rest...

      And that's just what she's doing... trying to catch her
      breath...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (in heaven)
                   Again?

78    INT. PARLOR, WHORE HOUSE, THE QUARTER - LATER STILL, 1932     78

      And we see Benjamin, at the door, happily smiling...

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Thank you...

                                 THE GIRL
                        (hurting)
                   No, thank you...

      Benjamin, floating on air, hovering, never wants to
      leave...

                                 THE GIRL (CONT'D)
                   Have a nice night...

                                BENJAMIN
                  You'll be here tomorrow?

                                THE GIRL
                  Every night, but Sunday...

     And she's finally able to go...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  It sure made me understand the
                  value of earning a living... the
                  things it can buy you..

     Benjamin turns to leave... we hear footsteps... And we
     see a man, putting on a raincoat, coming downstairs from
     one of those other rooms... We see it's Benjamin's
     father... THOMAS BUTTON... Seeing Benjamin he slows...
     Benjamin, unaware of who he is, turns and goes out...

79   EXT. STREET, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932              79

     It's a rainy night. Benjamin, feeling like a million
     bucks, walks along the street, going home... A
     chauffeured car pulls alongside him, the window rolled
     down... And we see Thomas Button in the car...

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's awful wet out. Can I offer
                  you a ride somewhere...?

                                BENJAMIN
                  That's very kind of you, Sir.

     He gets into the car.

80   INT. THOMAS' CAR, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932            80

     They drive in awkward silence.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

                                  BENJAMIN
                  I'm Benjamin.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                       (saying the name to
                        himself)
                  Benjamin... Yes, Benjamin... It's
                  a pleasure to know you.

     They shake hands.

                  Would you like to stop and have a
                  drink, Benjamin?

81   INT. BAR, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932                    81

     A small old bar. Benjamin and his father sitting in the
     back... The waiter comes over, deferring to Benjamin's
     age...

                                THE WAITER
                  What will it be sir?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I'll have whatever he's having.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  A Sazerac for both of us...with
                  whiskey instead of brandy...

     The waiter leaves.

                                THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                  You don't drink do you?

                                BENJAMIN
                  It's a night for firsts...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  How is that?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I've never been to a whore house
                  either.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  It's an... experience...

                                 BENJAMIN
                  It certainly is.
                       (and honestly)
                  I'm not very experienced about a
                  lot of things.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  That isn't a bad thing.

                                BENJAMIN
                  There's a first time for
                  everything.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  True enough. I don't mean to be
                  rude... but your hands seem awful
                  bent... It must be quite painful?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I don't really know what I have.
                  I have some form of a disease. I
                  have a lot of catching up to do.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  What kind of a disease?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I was born old.

     Thomas is quiet.    And for many things...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry.

                                BENJAMIN
                       (guileless)
                  No need to be. Nothing wrong with
                  old age.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  I'm sorry about your disease.

                                BENJAMIN
                  My mother says we're all born with
                  something...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                  Your mother?

                                 BENJAMIN
                  I'm adopted.

     Thomas looks at him... They get their drinks... Tap
     glasses, and drink. Benjamin coughs at the taste... But
     forces it down... And as they laugh at his discomfort...

     Thomas and Benjamin deep in conversation... and both of

                  She died in childbirth.

     And there's a moment when it seems like Thomas might tell
     him, but despite the alcohol he thinks better of it...

                  What line of work are you in, Mr.

                                THOMAS BUTTON
                  Buttons. "Button's Buttons."
                  There isn't a button we don't
                  make. Our biggest competition is
                  B.F. Goodrich and his infernal
                  zippers...

                  If you'll let me pay for it, Mr.
                  Button...

                  I'm a tugboat man.

     Benjamin holding the railing for support starts up the

               I listened to some music.... I --

     He doesn't mention the whore... But generically says...

                  I met some people.

     And right on cue Benjamin, wobbles...

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  I think mama... I'm going to...

     And to finish the evening, he throws up.

85   EXT. LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1934                      85

     The family's on the lawn...

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  I loved the weekends when she
                  would come and spend the night
                  with her grandmother.

86   INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - DAWN, 1934                         86

     Daisy, nine now, asleep in bed with Grandma Fuller... We
     see Benjamin quietly enter... He gently nudges Daisy
     awake...

                                BENJAMIN
                       (whispers)
                  Do you want to see something?   We
                  have to keep it secret.

     Daisy, always willing, always brave, gets up...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                       (whispers)
                  Get dressed. I'll meet you behind
                  the kitchen...

     And he leaves the room as quickly as he came...

87   EXT. BEHIND THE KITCHEN - NOLAN HOUSE - DAWN, 1934              87

     Benjamin, in an old peacoat, holding another -- waits...
     Daisy comes out... as he stops the door from slamming...

                                BENJAMIN
                  Ssssh...
                       (whispers)
                  Can you swim?

                  Put this on...

     He gives her a heavy coat...she puts it on... It's two
     sizes too big for her...

                                BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                  We have to go fast...

     And she follows him between the houses... the two of them
     going quickly down the street...

88   EXT. THE DOCKS, MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAYBREAK, 1934             88

     Fog. The first light of dawn. A full compliment of
     boats tied up for the night... They scamper along the
     dock... to the "Chelsea" ...Benjamin helps her climb
     aboard...

89   INT. TUGBOAT, MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAYBREAK, 1934               89

     He goes downstairs to find -- Captain Mike sprawled
     across his bunk -- in all his naked tattooed glory, an
     empty bottle on the floor...

                                DAISY
                  What's wrong with him?

                                BENJAMIN
                  I think he has mejembe.
                       (shaking him)
                  Captain Mike... could you take us
                  out?

     Captain Mike opens one eye... sees them standing there...

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  You know what day it is?

                                   BENJAMIN
                  Sunday.

                                CAPT. MIKE
                  Do you know what dat mean?

     He doesn't.

                                CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                  It means I was very drunk last
                  night.

                                BENJAMIN
                  You're drunk every night.

               A close friend... I wanted to show
               her the River.

                             CAPT. MIKE
               I'm not supposed to be joy-ridin'
               with civilians... I could lose my
               license.

     That notion stops him for about a nanosecond.

90   EXT. THE TUGBOAT, THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - EARLY, 1934       90

     The tugboat making its way through the fog... Benjamin
     standing with Daisy on the prow... the wind in their
     faces... And suddenly out of the fog a HORN BLARES... As
     loud as anything they have ever heard... and moving out
     of the mist, horn still echoing, a huge ocean liner
     appears... With three other tugboats pushing it to sea...

                             CAPT. MIKE
               She put in for repair... a wounded
               duck... She's flyin' now...

     Captain Mike joins the tugs at the liner's side... the
     tugs sounding horns of their own... a symphony of a
     kind... What interests Benjamin...

                             BENJAMIN
               What does it take to build
               something like that?

     Passengers line the railing... continuing their
     adventure... And what interests Daisy...

                             DAISY
               Imagine all the places they're
               going to see...

     Daisy, thrilled, waves to them -- the passengers along
     the rail, waving back... Benjamin stands by Daisy, their
     hair blowing in the salty air....

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
                    (to Benjamin)
               I wish we could go with them...

     As they watch the liner, like a foggy dream, sailing
     away...

                                                                  66.



91   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           91

     The rain and wind knocking at the window...

                             DAISY
                    (murmurs)
               I wish we could have...
                    (the morphine)

                             CAROLINE
               Did you say something, Mother?

     And there's a hint of anxiety in Caroline now... anxiety
     coupled with exhaustion... Daisy doesn't say anything.
     Caroline worriedly looks out the window.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               It seems to be getting worse.

     Daisy doesn't respond.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               Are you hearing me, mother?

                             DAISY
               Look at that... time just seeped
               out of me...

                               CAROLINE
               What?

                             DAISY
               Somebody will come and mop it up
               and that will be the end...

     Caroline can only listen... She takes a deep breath,
     gathering her strength...And when her mother's settled
     again...

                             CAROLINE
               Do you want me to go on reading?

     She murmurs, "Hmmm?" as if she didn't know Caroline had
     stopped. Caroline looks back down at the book.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               "Things were changing quickly."

               I don't know how it's possible,
               you seem to have more hair...

                               BENJAMIN
                    (a   little arrogant)
               What if   I was to tell you I wasn't
               getting   older -- I was getting
               younger   than everybody else...

     And she then says, taking the wind out of his sails...

                             THE WOMAN
               Well, I'd feel very sorry for
               you... to have to see everybody
               you love, die before you.

     He's quiet, he hadn't thought of that...

                             THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
               That would be an awful
               responsibility...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had never thought about life or
               death that way before...

     He's still... And seeing he's upset, she says the most
     beautiful of things...

                             THE WOMAN
               Benjamin... We're meant to lose
               the people we love. How else
               would we know how important they
               are to us.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And one fall day... a familiar
               visitor came knocking on our
               door...

                             BENJAMIN
               Would you like to go for a walk?

     There's no response. He opens it, going inside... The
     Woman is sitting in a chair by the window, the dog at her
     feet, the familiar Victrola playing dance music... He
     comes around the chair. And he sees she's still...
     perfectly still... her soul moved on...

                                                                  68.



94   EXT. CEMETERY PLOT, NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1936         94

     We see an old New Orleans paupers' cemetery... Benjamin
     and the mourners, and because he can't remember her name,
     around an unmarked grave...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               She had taught me how to play the
               piano.

     As Benjamin watches the woman go to her final rest.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               And she taught me what it meant to
               miss somebody.

95   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, ATTIC - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937        95

     We see Benjamin taking some things out of a dresser
     drawer, packing a suitcase...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I had gone to a whore house, I'd
               had my first drink, I had said
               goodbye to one friend and buried
               another... In 1937, when I was
               coming to end of the 17th year of
               my life, I packed by bag.

     We see him putting some final things into the suitcase,
     closing it...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...and said goodbye...

96   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1937            96

     We see Benjamin moving through the parlor, one by one,
     saying his good-byes to the old people...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               I knew, life being what it was, I
               would probably never see them
               again...

     The familiar faces... And as we watch him affectionately
     touch or talk to each of them... we can just see out a
     screen window DAISY, almost thirteen now, leaning against
     the side of the house... Out of sight... as if she didn't
     say goodbye, he wouldn't leave...

                                                                    69.



97   EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1937                 97

     We see TIZZY on the porch holding Benjamin's suitcase for
     him... The woman's old dog lying beside him...

                             TIZZY
                    (shaking his hand)
               Good luck, son.

     And we see Queenie has come out onto the porch with her
     little girl... and he holds Queenie... tears running down
     her face...

                             BENJAMIN
               Goodbye, Mother...

     He bends to pet the old dog goodbye... He takes up his
     suitcase and starts off the porch... going down the
     walkway... he hesitates, and opens the gate... moving out
     onto the street... When suddenly Daisy is calling him...

                             DAISY
               Benjamin... Benjamin...

     She comes running.   He stops to let her catch up to
     him...

                             DAISY (CONT'D)
               Where are you going?

                               BENJAMIN
               To sea.    I'll send you a postcard.

                             DAISY
               From everywhere. Write me a
               postcard from everywhere...

     And with so much she wants to say, she can't say
     anything. So she runs away... He watches her go,
     watchers her thin legs running back down the street...
     and he turns and moves off along the street...

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
               And I went off to sea...

     We see him in the distance, the "old man", a 17 year old,
     suitcase in hand, going to find out who he is and what he
     is to become...

                  I think I should find out what's

                  There's a box of them... in a
                  velvet bag...

     Caroline, not sure what she wants, opens a red velvet
     bag... she finds a wooden cigar box...

                                CAROLINE
                  Is this what you're looking for?

                                 DAISY
                  Looking for?

                                CAROLINE
                  You said you wanted this?

                                 DAISY
                  Of course.

     She gives her the box... Daisy, opens it... It's filled
     with postcards... Daisy, going through them...

                                DAISY (CONT'D)
                  Can you imagine... He sent me
                  postcards from everywhere he
                  went... every place he worked...
                  Newfoundland... Baffin Bay...
                  Liverpool... Glasgow...Narvik...

     She takes one out, reading it... Taking up some others...
     looking... reading where they came from... reading off
     like an adventure...

     Daisy, the postcards, fond memories spread out on the bed
     around her...

                Captain Mike had contracted for
                three years with Moran Brothers
                Tug and Salvage... The old ship
                had been refitted with a diesel
                engine, and a new sea winch... We
                went around Florida and up the
                Atlantic seaboard...

                Tell me how's it happen you showed
                up you were no bigger than a
                bollard. Now either I drink a

                do, or you sprouted... What's your
                secret?

      And Benjamin, tired of explanations, and what comes first
      to mind...

                Well Captain, you do drink a

      There's a packed BAR off the lobby... We see Benjamin
      sitting with Captain Mike, their crew, and a mixture of
      other seamen, Russians and other ethnics, all speaking
      different languages, sitting and standing around tables
      cluttered with bottles and glasses... Captain Mike,
      drunk, his shirt off, is telling a Russian sailor,
      another interpreting for him -- about a tattoo he has
      over his heart... an upside down hummingbird...

                back in Singapore by Sakumoro, the
                greatest tattoo artist ever lived.
                I puts it on myself from mem'ry.

      And now we know why it's upside down...

                   they were drunk every single
                   night...

      Then there's a shout -- and as if to underscore things,
      the Brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other
      again...

      We see Benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to
      take him to his room. He gets in, the elevator operator
      about to shut the grill door...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her name was Elizabeth Abbott. She
                   was not beautiful. She was plain
                   as paper... But she was as pretty
                   as any picture to me...

      "Plain as paper," ELIZABETH ABBOTT... Directly behind her
      walks a tall, tired man, in his 50s... By the look of his
      ruddy face, and her silent mien... they're both drunk...
      Benjamin finds himself looking at her...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   What are you looking at?

      She has a distinctly English accent. Benjamin doesn't say
      a word.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   If you must know, we have a long
                   standing agreement never to go to
                   bed sober. Isn't that right
                   darling?

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her husband was Walter Abbott...He
                   was Chief Minister of the British
                   Trade Mission in Murmansk... and
                   he was a spy...

      They ride up. Elizabeth has her shoes off...She sees him
      noting her stocking feet... The elevator finally rattles
      to a stop, and George and Elizabeth get off... Starting
      down the hall...she abruptly turns to say to Benjamin...
      so that it's completely understood...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I broke the heel off of one of my
                   shoes...I don't usually walk
                   around in my bare feet...

      And as he watches her saunter along the hallway... the
      way drunks do... endeavoring to keep her dignity...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   They were long days there...

115   EXT. MURMANSK HARBOR, RUSSIA - DAY, 1941                    115

      Benjamin on the tug, but it's less fun now, not much
      adventure, just hard work... Fighting the snow and the
      wind, they tow a large freighter into port...

                                                                  76A.



116   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - NIGHT, 1941        116

      Benjamin, in his small room, cold air blasting through
      the windows, looking out the window into the snowy
      night...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And longer nights...

      He lays on his bed looking out at the dark sky... the
      snow falling...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   One particular night... when I was
                   having trouble sleeping...

117   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941                117

      Benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively
      into the empty lobby... He slows, seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT
      in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely... and it's
      not the first time for her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry... I can't sleep...

      She's quiet... She finally looks up... but doesn't say
      anything... There's an awkward moment...exacerbated by
      the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I was going to make some
                   tea...would you like some?

      She shakes her head no... He crosses through the empty
      bar, into an old KITCHEN... He looks for tea... Puts
      water in a kettle... As he watches the kettle boil...
      Elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she
      were chilled, stands by the door... Benjamin, without
      asking, takes a cup for her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Milk...? Honey...?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Some honey, thank you.

      He finds a large honey jar... and seeing some dead flies
      in with the sweet syrup he asks...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you like flies with your tea?

      She smiles...for the first time... A thin smile... He
      starts to stir the tea... Elizabeth stopping him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You must let it steep for a
                   minute...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Steep?




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       78.

117   CONTINUED:                                                      117

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Sit. There's a proper way to make
                   tea.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Where I'm from, they just want it
                   to be hot.

      She doesn't smile. He gives her a cup of tea... She
      cradles the cup... They're quiet, drinking their
      tea...two strangers... After some moments...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You're a seaman? I don't mean to
                   be rude...but aren't you rather
                   old to be working on a boat?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   There's no age limit... as long as
                   you can do the work...

      She nods... They're quiet again. She sits at an old wood
      counter.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You have trouble sleeping?

      It's an invitation to sit with her... He pulls a stool
      over sitting across from her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I didn't know I did... I usually
                   sleep like a baby. Something kept
                   me up.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I never sleep... Well, rarely
                   anyway...

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   My father, when he was in his
                   eighties, was so sure he was going
                   to die in his sleep... He would
                   only take naps during the
                   afternoon... so that death
                   couldn't catch him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Did he?



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                    79.

                               ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Did he what?

                              BENJAMIN
                Die in his sleep?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                He died sitting in his favorite
                chair listening to his favorite
                program on the radio.

                              BENJAMIN
                     (smiles)
                He must have known something.

      She smiles at the idea... Another one... that goes as
      quickly as it's come... And it's quiet again...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                My husband's the British Trade
                Minister. We've been here fourteen
                months... We were supposed to be
                going to Peking... but it just
                never did work out. It never does
                seem to work out. Have you been to
                the Far East?

                              BENJAMIN
                I haven't really been anywhere. I
                mean outside different harbors.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Where are you from?

                              BENJAMIN
                New Orleans, Louisiana.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                     (pure Elizabeth)
                I didn't know there was another
                one.

      Which escapes him.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I've never been to America.
                Everywhere else. But not America.
                Am I missing anything?

                              BENJAMIN
                     (simply, guileless)
                The Mississippi River.

                And she told me all the places she
                had been, and what she had seen...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I can tell you what bars look like
                in places all over the world...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                And we talked until just before
                the dawn...

118   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DAYBREAK, 1941       118

      The first hint of daylight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Thank you for the tea...

      She leaves as quietly as she entered... Benjamin remains
      standing for a moment...then shuts the light off behind
      him.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                ...And we went back to our
                rooms... to our separate lives...

      And as he goes back up the quiet stairs...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And every night... we would meet
                in the middle Of the night...

119   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941 119

      Benjamin padding downstairs... slowing... happy to see
      Elizabeth, in her bathrobe, sitting in the empty lobby,
      waiting for him...

120   INT. KITCHEN, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - BEFORE DAWN, 1941 120

      Elizabeth and Benjamin quietly talking...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                A hotel in the middle of the night
                can be a magical place...

      And we see the empty front desk and tiny silver bell...
      The vacant lobby, with its musty old rugs... The open
      elevator, waiting... The dining room, with its crisp
      white tablecloths.

                   stopping...

      A mouse crossing the lobby floor doing just that...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   A radiator hissing. A sink
                   dripping. A floor creaking. A
                   curtain blowing.

      We see and hear it all... All the little sounds, a
      symphony, that make up life in a hotel in the middle of
      the night... Benjamin and Elizabeth sitting quietly
      drinking their tea.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There is something peaceful, even
                   comforting, knowing that people
                   you love are asleep in their beds,
                   where nothing can harm them...

121   INT. VARIOUS BEDROOMS - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941                    121

      Queenie and Tizzy asleep together in her bed... Their
      child on the floor... The old people in their beds in the
      old house. Ngunda Oti asleep in a room somewhere. The
      unnamed woman's grave. A different kind of sleep. And of
      course Daisy, in a New York apartment loft with other
      dancers... sleeping peacefully.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

                   The wrong impression?

                   You must think I don't love my

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Why do you say that?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Married women don't usually sit
                   with strange men in a hotel in the
                   middle of the night. I certainly
                   don't.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (honestly)
                   I don't know what married women do
                   or don't do.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Let's get one thing straight. I
                   love him very much. I happen to
                   think he is one of the smartest
                   and most considerate men I ever
                   met. It is not his fault I decided
                   to spend my life in his shadow.

      And with that she gets up and leaves... Benjamin, left
      with that thought...

123   INT. DINING ROOM, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941         123

      Benjamin and Elizabeth in the empty dining room at a
      table with a white tablecloth... with some wine and
      cheese... She's laughing now, measurably loosened up...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   He started to take his pants
                   off... I'm afraid he misread me
                   completely...

      He laughs. She looks through her wine glass at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Do you notice how people look
                   better through a wine glass...

      He holds his up.... looking at her....She moves her glass
      just looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You're a good looking man with or
                   without a wine glass...

      She picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to
      his... She puts her finger over his making a cross...

                   We are all just crossing in the
                   night. Sometimes we intersect.

      She leaves her finger there for a moment... lingering...
      She abruptly moves it away...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   I should go to bed... he'll be up
                   soon.

      She hesitates... And she kisses him, and then hurries out
      of the dining room... As Benjamin sits in the empty
      dining room... the kiss left on his lips...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was the first time a woman had
                   ever kissed me. It's something you
                   never forget.

124   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT          124

      The wind and rain knocking at the window. Daisy silently
      lying in bed.

                                 CAROLINE
                   Are you upset, Mother?

      She doesn't say anything. Caroline, seeing her feet have
      come out of the covers, caring, fixes her blanket.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Would you like some socks?

      Daisy's quiet.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Do you want me to stop reading?

      Daisy's answer for her is...

                                 DAISY
                   It must have been very cold. I'm
                   glad he had somebody to keep him
                   warm.

      Which Caroline takes as her cue to read on...

                                 CAROLINE
                        (after a beat,
                         reading)
                   "I couldn't wait to see her
                   again."

                                                                  83A.



125   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER LATE NIGHT, 1941     125

      Benjamin comes hurrying down the stairs. Elizabeth is
      waiting, as she normally is, but this time she is
      dressed... Lipstick and hair done... wearing a fur.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (self-conscious)
                   I'm not dressed --

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   You're delicious just as you
                   are...

      She laughs, taking his arm, walking to the dining room as
      if going to dinner... They sit at a table... which she
      has set for them... Caviar and Vodka...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Don't bother with the cheese or
                   the wine here, they're quite
                   common... but the caviar and the
                   vodka are plentiful and sublime...

      She feeds him a spoonful of the caviar...Unaccustomed to
      it, he swallows it too quickly...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   Take your time... If you eat it
                   all at once there will be nothing
                   left to enjoy... savor it...

      She gives him another spoonful... and takes one
      herself... He takes his time... They both do... savoring
      it...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (pouring)
                   Now, a swallow of vodka...

      Which they do... She laughs... Looking at him...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You haven't been with many women
                   have you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. Not many. At least none on a
                   Sunday.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (smiles)
                   I feel like I'm with a virgin.

      She's not far off... And it's a lovely thought... and it
      makes her think of her youth.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                When I was nineteen, I tried to
                become the first woman to swim the
                English Channel...

126   EXT. THE ENGLISH CHANNEL ­ DAY, 1911                        126

      And we see just that....Young Elizabeth, in goggles, her
      body covered with grease, swimming with two escort boats
      across the English Channel.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                The current was so strong...that
                for every stroke I took... I was
                pushed two strokes back...

      And we see just that, Elizabeth fighting the current...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                I swam for 32 hours... I was only
                two miles from the French shore...

      Elizabeth in sight of the lights of Calais...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When it started to rain...

      And it starts to rain on her... Harder and harder... the
      shore is suddenly gone from sight...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                              (CONT'D)
                When I couldn't go any further,
                and I just stopped...

      And we see her being taken onto a boat, a blanket wrapped
      around her...

127   EXT. CALAIS, BEACH - NIGHT, 1911                            127

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.)
                They asked me whether I would try
                again...?

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                Why wouldn't I?

      She smiles, a young girl, full of life...

                                                                   86.



128   INT. DINING ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - LATE NIGHT, 1941        128

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                I never did. As a matter of fact,
                I have never done much of anything
                with my life after that...

      And it's quiet. She touches his rough hand.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                Your hands are very rough... you
                have grease under your nails...

      She runs her fingernail along his face...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I can feel the wind on your
                face...

      They look at each other. And this time, Benjamin kisses
      her. It lingers... She stops herself...

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                I'm afraid it's the witching
                hour...

      She quickly gets up... And she's gone. As Benjamin sits
      in the empty dining room.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                It took me a long time to go to
                sleep.

129   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER LATE NIGHT, 1941      129

      We see Elizabeth nicely dressed, a bottle of champagne in
      her hand, sitting anxiously waiting. The elevator doors
      open. Benjamin in a suit and tie, as handsome as we've
      seen him steps out. She stands, takes his arm.

                              BENJAMIN
                Do I look okay? I borrowed it from
                one of the men. It's his church
                suit.

                              ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                You take my breath away.

      She walks with him, champagne bottle in hand, through the
      empty lobby...

                   The thing about clothing is, it
                   should make you feel comfortable,
                   then you will be comfortable...
                   Come, let's take a walk...

130   EXT. MURMANSK, RUSSIA - DEAD OF NIGHT, 1941                    130

      Their arms in each other's, their breath showing in the
      night, they walk through the sleeping Russian town, their
      shadows in the moonlight. They stop to share a drink from
      the champagne bottle. They laugh.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I feel so much younger when I'm
                   with you...

      And it seems he's about to go on... But Elizabeth,
      flattered, takes it metaphorically...

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   That's such a nice thing to say.
                   You make me feel years younger,
                   too. I wish I was. I would
                   change so many things. I would
                   undo all of my mistakes.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   What mistakes?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   I kept waiting, thinking I would
                   do something to change my
                   circumstance... Do something...
                   But I never did... It's an awful
                   waste, you can never get it
                   back... wasted time...

      They're quiet.    She looks at him.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                        (abruptly)
                   If we're going to have an affair,
                   you're never to look at me during
                   the day, we must always part by
                   sunrise, and we can never say "I
                   love you..."

      He's quiet...

                   And when it is over I will send
                   you a card that will simply say
                   goodbye... Those are the rules...

      They stand in the cold. His answer is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Are you as cold as I am?

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                        (laughs)
                   My god, colder.

      They stop to finish what's left of the champagne,
      Elizabeth hurling the bottle. The bottle falling silently
      into some fresh snow.

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D)
                   You can't even break a bottle
                   here.

      They look at each other and they kiss. And without
      anything else needing to be said, they start back...

131   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941      131

                                 ELIZABETH ABBOTT
                   Get a key.

      Benjamin goes behind the registration desk, taking an
      empty room key off a hook... They cross to the
      elevator...

132   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941 132

      They stand in the elevator as it ascends. Anticipating
      what's to come...

133   INT. HALLWAY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941    133

      They move along a dark hallway. He quietly unlocks an
      empty room door... And as he follows her into the room...
      the door closing.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She was the first woman who ever
                   loved me.

                                                                  89.



134   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER DAY, 1941            134

      Benjamin, in his peacoat, and stocking cap, snow on him,
      hurries into the hotel from work... He runs to the
      elevator, the doors just closing.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Hold it...

      It opens. He goes inside.      And Elizabeth's husband is
      standing in the elevator.

135   INT. ELEVATOR, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE DAY, 1941     135

      They silently ride up, not a word exchanged. The
      elevator stops. Elizabeth's husband gets out. As he
      quietly walks down the hall...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   We saw each other every night...
                   we always used the same room...

136   INT. HALL "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT TO DAWN, 1941     136

      We see the key going into the door... Benjamin and
      Elizabeth going inside closing the door behind them...
      leaving us with the quiet hallway.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   But each time seemed new and
                   different...

      And we see them as dawn creeps along the hallway,
      Benjamin and Elizabeth, leaving the room, not wanting to
      part, passionately kissing, and as they start to go their
      separate ways...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispering)
                   Elizabeth...

      She turns.

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (whispers)
                   You should swim the English
                   channel again.

      And as she laughs to herself and hurries off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Until one night...

                                                                   90.



137   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1941           137

      We see Benjamin coming down the stairs, into the lobby to
      meet Elizabeth. And he slows...Elizabeth isn't there. He
      looks into the bar...the kitchen....the dining room... He
      goes back to the lobby, sitting on a lone sofa, waiting
      for her... A mouse runs across the marble floor, stops,
      looks at him and runs off... And he sits and waits.

138   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - EARLY MORNING, 1941 138

      Snow shrouds the windows. We see Benjamin has fallen
      asleep on the sofa... There's the distinctive BELLOW of
      Captain Mike's VOICE. Benjamin wakes... He follows the
      bellowing to find Captain Mike with the tugboat CREW in
      the bar...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Roosevelt says we all got to do
                our part! After them Japs
                attacked Pearl Harbor everyone's
                got to! The Chelsea's been
                commissioned to serve in the
                United States Navy, to repair,
                tow, salvage and rescue... Anybody
                don't want to go to war, now's the
                time to say so... Once you set
                foot on that boat again, you're in
                the Navy friend!

                              BENJAMIN
                     (right away)
                I'll go captain!

                              CAPT. MIKE
                Easy old timer.
                     (to the men)
                I'll hold it against no man. But
                speak up now or forever hold your
                water.

      And the Cook, Prentis Mayes...

                              THE COOK
                I was planning on talking to you
                Cap'n Mike... My wife's doing
                poorly. I'd like to see her one
                more time...

                              CAPT. MIKE
                     (understanding)
                You're free to get home any way
                you can Mr. Mayes.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                       91.

138   CONTINUED:                                                      138

      And the cook walks off.

                                 JOHN GRIMM
                        (always dour)
                   Who do you intend to have cook
                   then? One of the leading causes
                   of death at sea is food poisoning,
                   right after inadequate safety
                   equipment.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I grew up cooking, sir. I'll take
                   the job, if I'm not too old to
                   serve.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You a real Johnny on the Spot,
                   Benjamin. I'll take any able
                   bodied mens who wants kick shit
                   out of the Japs and the Huns.

      And with no one dissenting...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Then that's it! We's goin' to
                   war, gentlemen!

      And filled with fervor, they give a cheer.

139   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, "WINTER PALACE" LATER, 1941               139

      Benjamin unlocking the door to his room. An ENVELOPE has
      been left under the door, he opens it.

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                   She had left a note. She wrote,
                   "it was nice to have met you."
                   That was it.

      And as he stands holding the letter in his room at the
      small Russian hotel:

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And so, I went to war.

140   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN, SOMEWHERE - NIGHT, 1941           140

      The men on the tug on a dark gray sea....

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It wasn't the war we expected. We
                   would tow crippled ships... scraps
                   of metal...
                                 (MORE)

140   CONTINUED:                                                     140
                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   across the high seas... If there
                   was a war, we didn't see it...

      And what seemed exciting, the idea of war... is
      tedious... The "Chelsea" towing a strange hulking shape
      on the dark, empty sea...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   There was a man assigned with
                   us... The Chief Gunner loved the
                   Navy, and most of all, he loved
                   America.

                                 THE MAN'S (V.O.)
                   There is no other country in the
                   world...! When YOU spell America,
                   A.M.E.R.I.C.A. You're spelling
                   freedom...!

      We see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen...
      sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun...
      ready to kick some enemy ass...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   His name was Dennis Smith and he
                   was a full blooded Cherokee... His
                   family had been in America for
                   over five hundred years.

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                   You have these pacifists. They
                   say they won't fight on
                   conscience. Where would we be if
                   everybody decided to act according
                   to their conscience?

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (out his Window)
                   Keeps it down, would you chief!

      He goes back inside... And as they settle into their
      tasks..

                                 DENNIS SMITH
                        (on his gun, to
                         himself, the last
                         word)
                   Where else can you shoot white
                   people and get away with it...

      Benjamin's the only one around to hear him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I worked in the kitchen...

                                                                   93.



141   INT. THE TUGBOAT KITCHEN - DAY, 1941                         141

      Benjamin busy preparing a meal in the galley kitchen. The
      Perpetually silent Pleasant Curtis, on kitchen duty,
      helping him with the preparation... while they work...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (trying to make
                      conversation)
                You're from the Kentucky mountains
                aren't you? It must be pretty
                there..

      Pleasant Curtis doesn't say a word. Benjamin shrugging,
      puts the pie in an oven.

142   INT. THE GALLEY - TUGBOAT - NIGHT                            142

      The men; including Dennis Smith, Pleasant Curtis, John
      Grimm, the "fighting" Brody twins, Benjamin serving them,
      silently eating dinner, rolling with endless rolling
      Ocean. Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves.

                              JOHN GRIMM
                There's something not normal about
                him.

      As they silently eat, mostly bored...

                              DENNIS SMITH
                     (looking outside)
                Whoever said "War is hell,"
                doesn't know shit from shinola.

143   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN -- ANOTHER NIGHT, 1942          143

      We see "Chelsea," a steel tow line splayed out from its
      winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the
      ocean...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We were towing a British
                freighter, that had gone dead in
                the water, 800 miles to Halifax
                for repair...

      We see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow
      line run out some thousand feet behind them...

144   INT. CREW QUARTER, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942     144

      We see Benjamin awake in his bunk, Dennis Smith asleep in
      the bunk above him.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      94.

144   CONTINUED:                                                     144

      Pleasant Curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him...
      Benjamin looking out at the black sea... and out of the
      silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks...

                                  PLEASANT CURTIS
                   I've been watching you. You seem
                   trustworthy. If something happens
                   to me... could you see this gets
                   to my wife...?

      He hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   He had given me all of his pay...
                   he hadn't spent a dime of it...

                                 PLEASANT CURTIS
                   If anything happens I want my
                   family to know I was thinking
                   about them, and if I could have,
                   I'd have come back home.

      And that said he turns back over... And as Benjamin looks
      at the dark foreboding sea... suddenly:

                                 CAPT. MIKE (OVER)
                        (calls)
                   All hands on deck!!!

      They bolt from their bunks... Going outside...

145   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     145

      Captain Mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking
      at the ocean... They see bodies of men, dead men,
      floating by them... One and two at first... then three
      and four... and then more and more until they are moving
      through a carpet of bodies...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   The war found us.

      As they move through the water... their propeller
      literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to
      veritably shut their engines down...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   A transport carrying 900 men had
                   been hit by a torpedo. We were
                   first to arrive at the scene...

      And as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT
      VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking
      quickly... Fuel oil burning on the water...
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                       95.

145   CONTINUED:                                                      145

      It's then we see the true horror of the men in the
      water... in the burning black oil... The transport boat
      silently slips into the water, disappearing under the
      sea...

146   EXT. TUGBOAT - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     146

      As the tug moves through the thick black smoke...
      Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the
      rails...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   There wasn't a sound...

      Except for the   lapping of water, and the tugboat's
      engines, there   isn't... just the silence of death...
      Something else   appears, doming onto the surface like a
      spectre... the   U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc...
      looking to see   the results... Captain Mike sees the
      sub...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                        (mad as hell)
                   We can't run from the fucker and
                   we can't hide...! There's only one
                   thing we can do...!
                        (and he shouts)
                   Battle Stations...!!!

      They run to their battle stations...

147   INT. PILOT HOUSE, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942         147

      Captain Mike at the wheel in the pilot house, turning the
      tug, furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine...

148   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                      148

      A German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the
      Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the
      tugboat... Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead
      cut open, bleeding... Despite the strafing the tug is
      relentless... The submarine, seeing it is about to be
      rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat
      ramming the submarine... severing the U-Boat in half. The
      concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in
      the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo
      exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process,
      blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men
      on the stern blown to pieces... Benjamin's literally
      thrown against the wheel house... He manages to get to
      his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... There's a
      man's voice...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      96.

      And he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body
      covered with blood... Benjamin bends to him... Captain
      Mike trembling as he lays dying...

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   Look at what they did! They shot
                   holes in me! They shots the hell
                   out my paintin'!

      His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is
      riddled...

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   You've seen a lot of things. Tell
                   me it's going to be alright.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're going to heaven Captain
                   Mike. You're going to heaven.

      Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying.
      And a light comes in Captain Mike's eyes... an
      understanding.

                                 CAPT. MIKE
                   You can be mad as a mad dawg at
                   the way things wents... You can
                   swear, curse the fates, regret
                   every'ting you ever dids... but
                   when it comes to the end... You
                   have to lets go...

      He looks in Benjamin's old eyes....

                                 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D)
                   Give me a hand, old man...

      And as he holds Benjamin's hand ready to meet his
      maker...

149   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATE AFTERNOON, 1942            149

      There are two destroyers and a hospital ship in the
      battle zone flow... Planes circling... The water still
      speckled with debris, and bodies...

150   EXT. A LIBERTY SHIP, THE NORTH ATLANTIC - DUSK, 1942           150

      We see Benjamin at the railing of a Liberty Ship.. He
      watches the "Chelsea" sink, disappearing under the sea...

                   736 men died that day... I said my
                   goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis
                   Smith, John Grimm who was right,
                   he was going to die there... I
                   sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his
                   money... I said goodbye to the
                   twin, Vic Brody...

      He instinctively turns, and sees Rick Brody looking out a
      porthole, lost without his twin brother...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   And to Mike Clark... Captain of
                   the tugboat "Chelsea."

      A storage cabinet is opened, a sailor taking out a
      wreath, from a supply of just such wreaths...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You mind...

      The Sailor shrugs, giving him the wreath...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I said goodbye to all the other
                   men... who had dreams of their
                   own... All the men who wanted to
                   be plumbers or singers or
                   insurance salesmen or doctors...
                   or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

      And suddenly, angrily, he throws the wreath into the
      water...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Out here, death didn't seem
                   normal.

      Benjamin standing at the rail of the ship... no longer a
      boy... And a SAILOR standing beside him....

                                 THE SAILOR
                   This don't get fixed...

      Benjamin's quiet. When suddenly a HUMMINGBIRD comes
      flying across the water... It circles the wreath, the way
      Hummingbirds do... and then flies off...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   ...I'd never seen a hummingbird
                   that far out to sea before...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                In the spring of 1945.... when I
                was 26 years old... I went home...

151   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            151

      We see Benjamin, suitcase in hand, going up the walk to
      the old house. We're struck by the difference... the old
      man who had left to see the world has returned a
      strikingly handsome man in his fifties. The old blind
      dog, smelling ham, ambles off the porch to meet him.
      Nothing seems to have changed. An old woman we don't
      know is rocking on the porch. A black girl, just 14... is
      hanging out wash...

                              BENJAMIN
                Is your mother home?

                              THE GIRL
                She's gettin' supper ready....

      He goes up the porch, inside....

152   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT, 1945            152

      Some old folks are in the front room... Nobody we know...
      He moves by them into the kitchen... the stovetop smoking
      and gurgling... He goes into the dining room... Queenie
      is busy setting the table... He watches her for a
      moment...

                              BENJAMIN
                     (quietly)
                Queenie...

      She turns, seeing him... she drops a plate...

                              QUEENIE
                Lord have mercy....you're home...

      She runs to embrace him... We see she's aged... the eight
      years he's been gone... and the 25 years or so since
      we've known her... now in her fifties...

                              THE GIRL'S (V.0.)
                     (asks)
                Who is that mama?

      The Girl comes inside... curious...

                                 QUEENIE
                   Your brother, Benjamin...

                                 THE GIRL
                   I didn't know he was my brother.

                                 QUEENIE
                        (laughs)
                   There's a shit load of things you
                   don't know...

      But her interest is in Benjamin....

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (studying him)
                   You look like you've been born
                   again... you're younger than the
                   springtime... I think that
                   preacher laid the hands on you
                   brought you a second life... I
                   knew the moment I saw you -- you
                   were special... Every night I got
                   on my knees asking the Good Lord
                   to bring you back safely. Remember
                   what I told you...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You never know what's comin' for
                   you.

      And they both share a good laugh at her homily... glad to
      be together once again.

                                 QUEENIE
                   Did you learn anything worth
                   repeating?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I saw a lot of things.

      She touches the scar, from the bullet, on his forehead.

                                 QUEENIE
                   You seen some pain.

      He nods.

                                   QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                   Some joy too?

      He nods, that too. And she holds him again.

                Where's Tizzy?

                              QUEENIE
                Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one
                night last April. He's sleeping
                comfortably now in the cemetery on
                St. James street, God rest his
                soul...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm so sorry...

      She turns from him so as not to cry....

                              QUEENIE
                There's only one or two of them
                left now... They all just about
                new... waitin' their turn like
                everybody else... I am so glad to
                have I you back. Now we got to
                find you some proper work and get
                you married right...

      And as she goes about readying the table for dinner,
      humming to herself...

      Benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters. And feeling out
      of place, out of time, he gets up and goes inside.

154   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER, 1945                 154

      We see Benjamin playing the piano in the parlor, the
      particular tune the Woman had taught him... an old man
      sitting nearby, seemingly listening... Queenie, looking
      in...

                              QUEENIE
                You're wasting your time... he's
                stone deaf... You'll be staying in
                what was Mrs. DeSeroux's room now,
                you're too much of a man to stay
                in the attic anymore.

      She goes about her business... And as Benjamin goes back
      to playing the piano for the deaf man... playing for
      himself...

155   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                    155

      We see Mr. Daws, much older now, asleep in an easy chair.

                   It's a funny thing about coming
                   home. Smells the same. Looks the
                   same. Feels the same.

      Mr. Daws awakens.    Seeing Benjamin.   As if he never left.

                                 MR. DAWS
                   Did I ever tell you I've been
                   struck by lightning seven times.
                   Once I was sitting in my truck
                   listening to the radio.

      And we see just that Mr. Daws sitting in his truck
      getting belted by lightning.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   You realize what's changed, is

                   And one evening, not long after I
                   had been back...

156   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ONE EVENING, 1945                 156

      We see Benjamin, coming down the stairs. He happens to
      glance out a casement window... He slows... He can just
      see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate. He moves
      to the next landing...where he can see a figure is
      getting out of the cab... The figure of a young woman,
      wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots... She
      strides through the gate... It takes us a moment to
      recognize her... the leggy thirteen year old girl is
      gone... replaced by a confident woman in her early
      twenties... with her red hair and her blue eyes she could
      be no one else but DAISY. Benjamin follows her progress,
      moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened
      windows... She moves gracefully past the porch with its
      swings... The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her,
      comes to greet her... Daisy going around to the back of
      the house... Benjamin moving to the back door, and just
      as Daisy starts to knock... Benjamin opening it...
      Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him.... and
      asks...

                   Benjamin...Oh my God it's you...
                   Of course it's you...

      They embrace, and there's a moment when the touch is not
      just of old friends, but something different... and they
      both, in that moment recognize that things will never be
      the same... Daisy, over-hugging him... the way young
      people do...

                                  DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin, how are you? It's been
                   such a long time... There's so
                   much I want to know... When did
                   you come back?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Just a few weeks ago...

                   I spoke to Queenie...she told me
                   you were in the war...somewhere at
                   sea... I was so worried about
                   you...

                        (simply)
                   I'm okay.

                   When I had left she was a girl...
                   and a woman had taken her place...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I can't get over you -- You are so
                   lovely...

                                 DAISY
                   You stopped writing.

                                 BENJAMIN

      Daisy's still. She touches her old face.

                                DAISY
                ...Beautiful.

                              CAROLINE
                He said, "The most beautiful,"
                Mother.

                              DAISY
                What else did he say about...

                                CAROLINE
                He said...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                "...Everything, in that moment,
                had changed between us..."

158   INT. BACK STAIRS, NOLAN HOUSE - TWILIGHT, 1945                 158

      Benjamin and Daisy going up the back stairs...

                               DAISY
                I can't get over you're home...
                I've been planning to come by for
                awhile... my grandmother, you
                remember Grandma Fuller... of
                course you remember her... she
                passed away...

                              BENJAMIN
                I heard that... I'm sorry...

                              DAISY
                I've been wanting to get some of
                her things...

      ...They go into her grandmother's room...

159   INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - TWILIGHT, 1945                    159

      Her grandmother's things are in boxes neatly stacked in a
      corner, waiting to be taken away... Daisy starts to go
      through them... Benjamin gives her a hand... As they go
      through things...

                                 DAISY
                   I can't believe I open the door,
                   and you're actually standing
                   there...It must be fate... What do
                   they call it, "Kismet"? I read a
                   book about a man named Edgar
                   Cayce, a psychic, everything is
                   predetermined...I like to think
                   it's fate. What do you think,
                   Benjamin?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't know how it works, but I'm
                   sure glad it happened...

      They inadvertently touch... the electricity of
      friction... both aware of the closeness... they move ever
      so slightly apart...

                                 DAISY
                        (nervously)
                   Have you been to New York...? It's
                   just across the bridge from me...
                   I can actually see the Empire
                   State Building if I stand on my
                   bed... Where have you been? Tell
                   me everything. The last time you
                   wrote you said you were in Russia?
                   I always wanted to go to Russia...
                   Is it as cold as they say...? You
                   wrote you met somebody... did it
                   work out...?

                                  BENJAMIN
                        (holding out)
                   Remember this?

      He's comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to
      them, Rudyard Kipling's "Just So." She sits on the bed...
      Benjamin sitting beside her... the two shoulder to
      shoulder... Daisy looking through the book... and
      reading....

                                 DAISY
                   ...This is the picture of Old Man
                   Kangaroo at five in the
                   afternoon..."

      She looks at him.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                You don't look like an old man
                anymore...You always said you were
                different... I think you must
                be...

      He doesn't say anything. The two of them sitting with
      their backs to us like the old friends they are...They
      touch... acutely aware of their proximity and before it
      can go any further...

                              BENJAMIN
                Are you hungry? Would you like to
                get something to eat?

                              DAISY
                I would love that...

      And the moment's gone...

160   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT                           160

      ...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion...
      and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man
      helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting
      out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked,
      elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear
      Daisy's voice, from somewhere else...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...I danced for a man named
                Ballenchine...He's a famous
                choreographer. He said I had a
                perfect line. They asked
                Ballenchine to describe what he
                did. He said, "I'm a carpenter."
                Isn't that amazing? In one of his
                rehearsals a dancer fell. He put
                it into the production. Can you
                imagine that in a classical
                ballet? A dancer intentionally
                falling? He isn't the only one,
                Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein,
                Richard Pleasant, Lucia
                Chase...There's a whole new word
                for dance now, it's called
                abstract..."

      The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another
      man showing her inside... Benjamin forgotten for the
      slightest of moments at the door... going after her.

                                                                   106.



161   INT. NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT, 1945                    161

      A crowded New Orleans restaurant. Daisy as a maitre d in
      slow motion is showing her to a table... Men's, and even
      women's, eyes following her...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                ...They have torn up all the
                conventions... the straight up and
                down style, all the things that
                bound dancers...It's not about the
                formality of the dance...the
                classical structure...it's about
                what the dancer's feeling...there
                are no rules; the movement can be
                tense or relaxed, abrupt or
                flowing, carefree or somber, it
                may suggest love or hate,
                attraction or repulsion. The
                unexpected shifts of weight or
                energy -- not just to shock but to
                reinvent tradition...putting the
                familiar form to new and
                unexpected uses. It's so basic
                Just you alone with your body...

      They reach a table... A chair in slow motion swept out
      for her to sit... another man in slow motion putting a
      napkin in her lap...

                              DAISY (V.O)
                They understand America's vigor
                and physicality -- they understand
                the freshness of the American
                people at their most modern, at
                their best.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                And she told me about this world
                that she was so attracted to...
                names that didn't mean a thing to
                me...I didn't really hear very
                much of what she was saying.

      We watch them at the table... Benjamin listening,
      appreciating her... her face aglow with the intensity and
      the passion of youth... Caviar is brought over...
      vodka... She screws up her mouth not wanting to eat... We
      can sense he's telling her, what he's learned from
      Elizabeth Abbott, how to savor it... He feeds her a
      spoonful... They drink the vodka washing it down... she
      laughs, delighted... And we now hear what she is
      saying...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      107.

                                 DAISY
                        (realizing)
                   Oh my god, I've been just talking
                   about myself...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm enjoying listening...

      She takes out a cigarette... He instinctively looks for
      matches, a man gets there first, lighting her cigarette
      for her... he watches the smoke curl around her...
      appreciating her...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I didn't know you smoked...

                                 DAISY
                   I'm old enough. I`m old enough
                   for a lot of things....

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Yes you are...

162   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS PARK - NIGHT                                 162

      We see Benjamin and Daisy, their silhouettes walking
      through the park... She puts her arm around his
      shoulder... being close to him...

                                 DAISY
                   I have to go back tomorrow... I
                   wish I could stay...

      They reach a GAZEBO... Not a soul around... They stand
      for a moment in the silence...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In New York we stay up all
                   night... I eat breakfast in a
                   diner on Houston with red booths
                   and watch the sun come up over the
                   buildings... there's always
                   something to do...

      Which is in stark contrast to Benjamin's life... Daisy,
      takes off her shoes...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Dancers... don't need costumes or
                   scenery.

      And showing him what she's been telling him about, she
      does a dance for him...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

162   CONTINUED:                                                      162

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I could imagine dancing completely
                   naked...

      Daisy, dancing for him... While she dances...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Have you read "D.H. Lawrence," his
                   books were banned... The words are
                   like making love....

      He stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her... she
      moves closer to him... She comes next to him and she
      kisses him... and when he doesn't respond... she tries a
      different tact...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   In our group... you have to trust
                   people... not be afraid... Sex...
                   is a big part of it... A lot of
                   the dancers... are lesbians... A
                   woman wanted me to sleep with
                   her....

      He's quiet.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Does that upset you?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Which part?

                                 DAISY
                   That someone wanted to sleep with
                   me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   People should want to sleep with
                   you... You're very desirable...

                                 DAISY
                   Let's go back to the house... or
                   get a room somewhere... we can put
                   down your coat...

      She takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the
      park... There's nothing he'd like more... but...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's not that I don't want to... I
                   just can't... not tonight....Its
                   just not...

                              DAISY
                I'm old enough.

      And despite how available she is, how desirable she is...

                              BENJAMIN
                Go back to New York, Daisy... Be
                with the people you are so fond
                of... You can only be young
                once...

                              DAISY
                Do you think you are too old for
                me... I've been with older men...

      And when he still doesn't respond...   Daisy, rejected,
      takes up her shoes... And she starts   off... Benjamin
      coming beside her... but they're not   really walking
      together anymore... and the time for   them, this time, has
      gone away...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                You only get so many chances to be
                with someone... I let her go...
                and I missed it...

163   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT            163

      Daisy, caught in the distant time...

                              DAISY
                You look so handsome in that
                suit... your hair...

      A Nurse looks in...

                              THE NURSE
                They're sayin' the hurricane's
                going to miss us... blow right on
                by...

                              CAROLINE
                Oh, that's great.

      The Nurse goes off down the hall, her voice telling

                   Isn't that good news, Mother?

      But Daisy is in still another place and another time...

                                    DAISY
                   Good news?

                                    CAROLINE
                   The hurricane.     It is going to
                   miss us.

                                 DAISY
                   I'll just stay under the blankets
                   with my mother. She said nothing
                   would happen to me.

      She looks at the book.

                   Benjamin?

                   Would you like me to keep reading?

      Daisy nods.

                   He said, "Things were becoming
                   different for me..."

164   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                 164

      Benjamin lying on his bed, his glasses on, reading...
      "D.H. Lawrence"... We see he's squinting... We see his
      POINT OF VIEW, the print, is blurred... He takes off the
      glasses, looks at the print... and it's clear as a
      bell...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I didn't need glasses anymore...

      And we see Benjamin, naked, standing in front of a full
      length mirror, looking at himself, studying himself....

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   My hair had very little gray and

                   My sense of smell was keener... my
                   hearing more acute... I could walk
                   further and faster...

      He can see outside an ambulance has arrived... to take
      away another of the old people...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   While everybody else was aging...
                   I was getting younger... all
                   alone...

      And as he quietly looks at himself... There's a KNOCK on
      the door..

                                 A MAN'S (V.0.)
                   Benjamin...

      He puts something on, and opens the door. And as if to
      underscore what he's just said, he sees THOMAS BUTTON in
      his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet
      bandaged, standing in the doorway...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Hello, Benjamin... Do you
                   remember me?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Of course, Mr. Button... What
                   happened to you?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   My foot was infected... I'm afraid
                   they had to remove it...
                        (beat, without irony)
                   Welcome home, my friend.

165   INT. DELMONICO'S STEAK HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945         165

      The bar and restaurant crowded with men, many with
      various kinds of handicaps from the war, drinking away
      their demons... And we see Benjamin and Thomas sitting at
      a table... thick steaks, baked potatoes, drinks at their
      elbows...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still drinking Sazerac with
                   whiskey instead of brandy.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I'm a man of habit.

                   Are you still visiting the house
                   on Bourbon street?

                        (smiles)
                   Not for a long time.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I told him about my life... about
                   my time at war... and he told me
                   how he had devoted his business to
                   making buttons for the war
                   effort...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   The war has been kind to the
                   button industry... we had gone
                   from making forty thousand buttons
                   a day to making two hundred and
                   fifty thousand... We employed ten
                   times the number of workers... We
                   were operating around the clock...

      And he quiets... the sound of the busy restaurant... And
      after some moments Thomas tells him...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I don't know how much longer I
                   have to live...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'm sorry to hear that, Mr.
                   Button.

      And it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire
      truth... but he can't bring himself and instead...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I don't have any people. I keep to
                   myself. I -- I'm frightened. I
                   hope you won't mind... but
                   whenever it's possible... I would
                   enjoy your company...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'll do what I can, Mr. Button.

      They quietly eat.

                "bouton," meaning a bud, or any
                round object...

      They come into a corridor. Thomas unlocking another door.

                They were originally decorative,

      They walk through the quiet factory...

                              THOMAS BUTTON
                The practice of buttoning
                originated in the 13th century...
                when baggy clothing was replaced
                with more form-fitting clothes...

      Thomas, on his crutches...past the lines of work
      benches... Mannequins in uniforms of the armed
      services... with their various gold and silver buttons...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Button's Buttons has been in our
                family for one hundred and twenty-
                four years. My grandfather was a
                tailor. He had a small shop in
                Richmond. After the Civil War he
                came to New Orleans.

                   My father saw the wisdom of making
                   our own buttons. The tailor shop
                   grew to this... And today...
                        (a smile)
                   I can't sew a stitch.

      Benjamin is interested, but the obvious question is...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   It's all very interesting.   But
                   what do you want from me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I said, our family has been in the
                   business for a hundred and twenty-
                   four years.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Our family?

      And it's as if he has opened a flood gate...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   You are my family. Benjamin, you
                   are my son.

      And tears run down his anguished face... Benjamin's
      still...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I am so sorry not to have told you
                   before...

      Benjamin hasn't moved. The words ring in his ears.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   You were born the night the great
                   war ended... Your mother died
                   giving birth to you... I
                   thought... I thought you were a
                   monster... I left you on the back
                   steps of a house... I promised
                   your mother I'd make sure you were
                   safe... I should never have
                   abandoned you...

      Benjamin's dead quiet... He looks at this man, his
      father...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My mother?

169   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, THE GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1945       169

      We see Benjamin and Thomas in a hallway leading to the
      kitchen of the large house... The hallway filled with:
      photographs of the Button Family. Thomas pointing out
      relatives... Family photographs...

                               THOMAS BUTTON
                ...A great uncle, from Germany.
                      (and a group picture)
                All of the men in the family at
                the Lake House...
                      (notices the date on
                       it)
                1915, three years before you were
                born.

      A photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair
      on the dock of a lake.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                Your grandfather at the summer
                house on Lake Pontchartrain. When
                I was a boy I would love to wake
                up before anybody else and run
                down to the lake to watch the day
                begin. It was as if I was the only
                one alive.

      And they've come to a young Woman's photograph... who
      could only be Benjamin's mother. He stops...

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I fell in love with her the first
                time I saw her.
                     (beat)
                Your mother's name was Caroline
                Murphy. She was 20. She worked in
                your grandfather's kitchen...She
                was from Dublin... Her father,
                your maternal grandfather, was a
                chimney sweep... He died in the
                flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline
                came with her mother, two sisters,
                and four brothers in 1903 to live
                in New Orleans.

      They stop at the kitchen door.

                              THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                I would find reasons to go to the
                kitchen... just to look at her...

      He does just that... Looking through the round window
      into the empty kitchen... as if she was there those years
      ago... as if she was still there...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   The happiest day of my life was
                   April 25th, 1918 the day I married
                   your mother.

      They move along the hallway... Benjamin looking at the
      photographs... his bloodlines... After some moments:

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Why didn't you tell me?

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   I made a mistake.

      Benjamin looks at him.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   Come and take your rightful
                   place... with your family... with
                   me...

      When Benjamin doesn't say anything...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   We can catch up for all the lost
                   time...

      And when he still doesn't answer...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
                   I'm planning on leaving everything
                   I have to you...

      His "bribe" strikes a nerve.

                                  BENJAMIN
                   I better go.

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Where are you going?

                                  BENJAMIN
                   Home.

      Benjamin turns his back and walks out.

                                                                   117.



170   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1946                            170

      Benjamin standing by the door, Queenie sitting up in her
      bed...

                              QUEENIE
                     (unforgiving,
                      angrily)
                He's what?! All those years he's
                creeping around here, and never
                tells us who he is?!! I thought he
                was just queer or somethin' comin'
                around here... always askin' for
                you... He left us $18 that night
                you was found... Eighteen ratty
                ass dollars and a dirty diaper...!
                Now he wants to be your father? He
                wants you to sit at his side...!
                He wants your forgiveness! I won't
                ever forgive him for any of it...
                God's the only one that can
                forgive him!
                     (finished)
                Now I got to get up early with
                Mrs. Hamilton... or she gonna
                drown...
                     (but not finished)
                ...He thinks he can just show up,
                and everything gonna be fine and
                dandy, everybody gonna be
                friends... He got another thing
                coming...

      And with that she turns over, to go back to sleep,
      Benjamin quietly leaves the room.

171   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - BACK STAIRS, HALLWAY - NIGHT          171

      He climbs the back stairs to his room, as if he's
      carrying a terrible burden... as he comes onto the
      hallway, Mr. Daws is sitting on a bench in the hall...
      Seeing Benjamin...

                              MR. DAWS
                Did I ever tell you I was struck
                by lightning seven different
                times. Once, I was walking my dog
                along a country road.

      And we see just that, when suddenly he's struck by
      lightning. The dog, unharmed, licking his face.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      118.

171   CONTINUED:                                                      171

                                 MR. DAWS (CONT'D)
                   I'm blind in the one eye...I can't
                   hardly hear...I get twitches and
                   shakes out of nowhere... I lose my
                   line of thought... but you know
                   what... God, for some reason,
                   keeps on sending me a wake-up...
                   It's His way of reminding me I'm
                   lucky to be alive...
                        (a beat, sniffs the
                         air)
                   Storm's comin'.

      And   gets up and pads off into his room. Benjamin, left in
      the   hallway...He goes over to look out the window, like
      the   boy we remember looking out at the street lights...
      the   street...

172   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                172

      We see Benjamin being let in by a Butler into the
      fashionable home.

173   INT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                173

      Benjamin in the dark hallway, quietly walking among the
      photographs of "his" family. He goes up the staircase. He
      goes to his father's room. He quietly opens the door. The
      room's dark, his father asleep. He goes to his father's
      bed. His father's frail figure.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (whispers)
                   Thomas...

      Thomas awakens...seeing Benjamin...

174   EXT. THOMAS BUTTON'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT                174

      We see Benjamin wheeling his father in a wheelchair out
      of the house...And...

175   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - SUNRISE                    175

      The endless lake. And we see Mr. Button's chauffeured car
      driving along the lake.

176   EXT. THE BUTTON SUMMER HOME, LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN - SUNRISE 176

      The car's stopped at a chain across the driveway of an
      old summer home. Benjamin helps to put Thomas into his
      wheelchair. He wheels him up the long drive to the house.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                     119.

176   CONTINUED:                                                     176

      All closed up. Shuttered. There are steps that lead down
      to the lake. He starts to wheel his father down the
      steps. The steps are too steep for the wheelchair.
      Benjamin reaches, picking his father up out of the chair.
      He carries him down the steps, but that too is arduous...

      And he puts his father on his back...His father holding
      onto his son, as Benjamin carries him on his back down
      the steps to the dock. There's an old wooden deck chair.
      He helps his father sit in the chair. And as his father
      sits for the last time, watching the lake...

                                 THOMAS BUTTON
                   Thank you, Benjamin.

      Benjamin sitting at a distance behind him...Both of them
      watching the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   You can be mad as a mad dog at the
                   way things went...You can swear,
                   curse the fates, regret everything
                   you ever did... but when it comes
                   to the end... You have to let
                   go...

      And as his father shuts his eyes, sitting in the sun.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   I buried him in the Button family
                   plot.

177   EXT. AN OLD CEMETERY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                  177

      We see Benjamin standing at his father's gravesite in the
      family plot, with ornate headstones...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   I had a tailor sew onto his best
                   coat -- a button for every year of
                   his life....fifty-five of them...
                   all different, pearl and silver,
                   brass and wood... in case he lost
                   one along the way...

      And as he stands at the gravesite... He hears something.
      Queenie has come to be with him...to comfort him...

                                 QUEENIE
                        (why she's here)
                   Don't you suffer alone for it.

      She takes his arm, always there for him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                      120.

177   CONTINUED:                                                      177

                                 QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                        (looking around)
                   It's a beautiful cemetery... And
                   buried here right next to your
                   mother.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (looks at her)
                   His wife.

      And as they stand at the gravesite...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I went to pay a visit to the
                   button factory.

178   INT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1946                    178

      We see Benjamin with an elderly woman, MS. SANDERSON,
      standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory
      work floor... looking down upon the workers, exclusively
      women, and exclusively white women, making buttons...The
      women, seeing him, look up, and there's a sudden hush...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   My name is Benjamin, Benjamin...
                        (for the first time)
                   Button...

      They stare up at him...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   As you know, my father...

      It still sounds strange to him.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   ...My father, Thomas Button...
                   recently passed...

      After a moment:

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   He asked that I take over the day
                   to day operation of Button's
                   Buttons.

      They silently stare up at him....

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Well, I don't know the first thing
                   about buttons...and I don't know a
                   thing about business...
                                 (MORE)

178   CONTINUED:                                                  178
                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                        (after a beat)
                   Button's Buttons has been in my
                   father's family for over 100
                   years. It could not have survived
                   without people like you. My father
                   asked me to tell you how much he
                   appreciated the hard work you put
                   in for him and his company for so
                   many years.

      Dead still... And after a moment;

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I have decided that all of you --
                   his loyal employees, will have a
                   share, depending on your length of
                   employment, in the ownership of
                   this factory, his legacy.

                                 ONE OF THE WOMEN
                   We're the owners now?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That's about it.

      They're literally dumbfounded.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Mrs. Sanderson will explain how
                   everything works and will answer
                   any of your questions...

      And with that he turns, walking away...Having "given away
      the store"... the workers in disbelief looking up at
      him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I went to New York.

179   EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT, 1947                           179

      We see a cab pull up and Benjamin, in a nice suit,
      flowers in hand, daisies, gets out, hurrying into The
      Majestic Theater, the marquee telling us "CAROUSEL," is
      performing.

180   INT. THE MAJESTIC THEATER, NYC - NIGHT, 1947                180

      Benjamin, coming in late, being shown to his seat. And we
      see the production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical
      "Carousel," with Mielziner's seminal stage design, as
      choreographed by Agnes De Mille... And we see the dancer
      is Daisy...dancing with the man of her dreams, the "bad
      boy" carnival barker... while Benjamin watches her.

                                                                   122.



181   INT. BACKSTAGE, THE MAJESTIC THEATER - NYC - NIGHT, 1947     181

      We see Benjamin, flowers in hand, making his way through
      a crowded backstage corridor filled with friends and well-
      wishers giving cast members congratulations. He comes to
      the door... to the attention of a STAGEHAND...

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm a friend of Daisy's...

      The man matter-of-factly opens the door... A dressing
      room crowded with dancers changing out of their
      Costumes... He calls out...

                              THE MAN
                Daisy has company...

      We can hear Daisy's name being said...Benjamin waiting...
      He sees Daisy, in a robe, coming through the room....

                              DAISY
                Somebody's looking for me?...

      ...And she sees it's Benjamin. And rather than excited to
      see him... She's startled he's there... and not
      altogether pleased about him showing up...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Benjamin... What are you doing
                here?

      And he realizes, as most of us have in one love affair or
      another, whatever his expectations may have been, his
      fantasy, is not the reality...

                              BENJAMIN
                I thought I'd come visit... spend
                some time with you if I could...

                              DAISY
                I wish you would have called...
                You caught me by surprise.

      He gives her the flowers, the daisies.

                              BENJAMIN
                I couldn't take my eyes off of
                you... you were mesmerizing...

                              DAISY
                That's so nice of you to say...
                These are lovely... Thank you...

      There's an awkward moment... and...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I better get changed... a group of
                   us are going to a party... would
                   you like to come...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Somebody told me about a
                   restaurant I thought you might
                   enjoy... I made a reservation...
                   Just in case --

                                 DAISY
                        (awkwardly)
                   ...all the dancers go out together
                   after the show... You're welcome
                   to come with us... There'll be all
                   sorts of interesting people... Let
                   me get changed.

      And she runs back inside the dressing room... Benjamin
      left to stand in the hallway....

182   INT. A NEW YORK LOFT - NIGHT, 1947                              182

      A loft elevator opens depositing Benjamin and Daisy along
      with a bunch of people into a large loft... crowded with
      her friends, dancers and show people, musicians,
      predominantly young people, straight and gay, beatniks
      before there were beatniks, bohemians... Music playing...
      People pressed together, having to shout to talk...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I met her friends...

                                 DAISY
                   I'll get you a drink...

      As she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink, she is
      startled as a young man, DAVID, suddenly grabs her,
      kissing her, a kiss that's not intended to be platonic...
      Daisy obviously involved with him... but embarrassed by
      the intimacy in front of Benjamin and not wanting to hurt
      his feelings... she pulls awkwardly away from him...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   This is my friend David... David
                   dances with our company too...
                   This is the man I've told you
                   about, Benjamin...

      They shake hands... Daisy, wanting to escape.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      124.

182   CONTINUED:                                                      182

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'll get you that drink. - -

      ...she goes into the kitchen...

                                 DAVID
                   You were her grandmother's friend
                   or something like that...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Something like that.

      And Daisy comes back out with a drink for him... and one
      of her own... But before she can give him his drink, a
      woman takes it from her... and starts to dance with
      her... but not with her... the way dancers do... and many
      of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like
      it... David, comes to dance with Daisy... Benjamin
      standing watching Daisy dancing with him... as only
      dancers can... in complete control of their bodies and
      yet totally uninhibited... Benjamin sees David kiss
      her... and his jealousy getting the best of him, he turns
      and leaves...

183   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              183

      Daisy in her turban... listening to Caroline read..

                                  DAISY
                        (whispers)
                   I knew I'd hurt you... Maybe I
                   intended to...

184   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT, 1947                              184

      Benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the
      street. Daisy running after him...

                                 DAISY
                   I did what you told me to... enjoy
                   my life... I'm only going to be
                   young once... I had no idea you
                   were coming. What did you think I
                   was going to do...? You can't
                   expect me to just drop everything,
                   Benjamin... this is my life...

      And we see DAVID and a group of her dancer friends have
      come outside down the way into the street... looking for
      cabs...

                                 DAVID
                        (to Daisy)
                   There's a party downtown we're
                   going to...

                                 DAISY
                        (conflicted, to
                         Benjamin)
                   Why don't you come with us,
                   Benjamin... There'll be a lot of
                   musicians, interesting people
                   there.... You'll have a good
                   time...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I came here to tell you I made a
                   mistake before...A day doesn't go
                   by that I don't regret it...It's
                   not the way I felt...I should have
                   never let you go...I came because
                   I hoped I could be with you...

                                 DAVID
                   Daisy, you going to come...?

      Cabs have pulled up... She's torn... between her life and
      some other life... Benjamin, recognizing her conflict...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Do you love him?

185   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              185

      Daisy in bed...

                                 CAROLINE
                   Did you Mother?

      Daisy snaps back to the reality of the room... Starts to
      put the pieces together...

186   EXT. THE MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT, 1947                         186

                                 DAISY
                   I think so. I think I do.

      We see the dancers scrambling getting into the taxis...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (understanding)
                   Okay. Okay... I'll see you in New
                   Orleans...

186   CONTINUED:                                                  186

      He turns to go... she's motionless, caught between the
      two worlds... And we expect her to yell after him, to
      stop him... But instead, she does what we all do in these
      moments, what feels good at the time... She runs to be
      with her friends... She gets into a taxi... The cab
      drives by him as they leave... Daisy turned to look out
      the back window... looking back at him... He waves...
      letting her go... And another chance for them is
      missed... The street's quiet. And hands in his pockets, a
      middle-aged man going on 26... he walks off into the
      night...

187   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          187

                                  DAISY
                         (remembers)
                   He came to tell me his father had
                   died.

                                 CAROLINE
                   You couldn't have known.

                                 DAISY
                   I was 23...I just didn't care...

      She's quiet with her thoughts... and, remembering, she
      hums to herself some distant memory of music...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...There are some photographs I
                   think... the zipper part of the
                   large bag...

      Caroline goes to the suitcases... she comes back with a
      manila envelope... Daisy dumps them out...and we see
      they're photographs of Daisy dancing at the height of her
      abilities...

                                 CAROLINE
                   I've never seen these... You never
                   talked about your dancing very
                   much...

      Daisy looks at the photographs...

                                 DAISY
                   I was as good as I was ever going
                   to be. For five years... I danced
                   everywhere... London, Prague,
                   Vienna, and I was the only
                   American invited to dance with the
                   Bolshoi... It was glorious...

                                                                   127.



188   EXT. MOSCOW STREET - NIGHT, 1952                             188

      And we see Daisy, five years older, her arm inside a tall
      young blond Russian dancer's, ANITOLY, crossing a snowy
      street in Moscow...

                              DAISY (V.O.)
                But Benjamin was never far from my
                thoughts...

189   INT. MOSCOW APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1952                          189

      Daisy in bed, the young Russian dancer Anitoly lying
      beside her, asleep... Daisy, looking off...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                I'd find myself saying...

                              DAISY
                Goodnight, Benjamin...

190   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1952              190

      We see Benjamin in bed, turning off the light...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                I'd find myself saying...
                     (a beat, saying)
                Goodnight, Daisy.

      And as they both lie in their beds... thinking of the
      other...

191   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT       191

                              DAISY
                What did he say?

                              CAROL
                "Life wasn't very complicated..."

192   EXT. THE BAYOU, LOUISIANA - DAY                              192

      We see Benjamin on Tizzy's old motorcycle riding along
      the backroads of the endless swamps known as the bayou -

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                If you want you could say I was
                looking for something...

      As he rides away...

193   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - AN EARLY EVENING, 1954                   193

      Benjamin in work clothes on a ladder, painting some old
      window shutters... Queenie opens the window... to tell
      him...

                                 QUEENIE
                   Mrs. La Tourneau just passed away.

      Benjamin nods. Queenie shuts the window.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   Until one day...

      A Messenger on a bicycle rides up...

                                 A WESTERN UNION MESSENGER
                   I have a telegram for Mr. Benjamin
                   Button...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   That would be me....

      He comes down the ladder. The Messenger gives him the
      telegram and getting his tip, rides off, Benjamin opens
      the telegram.

194   EXT. A STREET IN PARIS, FRANCE - DAY, 1954                      194

      We see Benjamin, carrying a suitcase, running along a
      street in Paris... looking for an address... He stops, in
      front of an old HOSPITAL... runs up the stairs...

195   INT. A HOSPITAL, PARIS, FRANCE - DAY, 1954                      195

      Benjamin crosses an old tile floor to a reception desk...
      He asks for Daisy... a Woman calls up for him...

                                  THE WOMAN
                   It will just be a minute... please
                   have a seat...

      Benjamin sits in the waiting room.

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   Sometimes we are on a collision
                   course and we just don't know
                   it... Whether it's by accident or
                   by design, there's not a thing we

                going shopping... who had missed
                getting the earlier cab...

      We see the Woman riding in the taxi of the now familiar
      cab driver... the taxi, has to stop for a man running
      across the Street.

                for work five minutes later than
                he normally did... because he
                forgot to set his alarm...

                a package... which hadn't been
                wrapped yet because the girl who
                was supposed to wrap it... had
                broken up with her boyfriend the
                night before and forgot to...

                And her leg was crushed...

      She's still, her eyes closed. Sensing him, she stirs. And
      then she sees him.

                              BENJAMIN
                Hello, Daisy...

                Who told you?

                              BENJAMIN
                Your friend wired me.

                               DAISY
                That was very kind of you... to
                come all the way here, to see that
                I was alright.

                              BENJAMIN
                You would have done the same for
                me...

      And her first reaction, to how young he is...

                My God, look at you. You're
                perfect....

      Which she isn't... She's quiet, and she suddenly says:

      She turns over... as if she didn't see him he wouldn't be
      there... Before he can say anything... A Nurse comes in
      saying something in French... She pulls the curtains
      around the bed... Benjamin waits...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   Her leg had been broken in five
                   places.... and with therapy, and
                   time, she might be able to
                   stand...maybe even walk...

      The Nurse leaves... Benjamin comes into the circle of
      curtains... It's reminiscent of when they sat under the
      table... the sheets over them... in their private
      world... But this time she lays in the hospital bed her
      back to him...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I'll get a room... and once you
                   can leave you'll come home with me
                   to New Orleans. Where you can be
                   with people who love you.

      She suddenly turns...

                   What home? Who's we? I'm not going
                   back to New Orleans. New Orleans
                   is your home... I don't have a
                   home... I haven't been home for
                   five years... I'm not going
                   anywhere with you...

                   Alright, I'll stay here in
                   Paris... I'll help you with
                   anything you need...

                               BENJAMIN
                 You'll change your mind.

                 We're not little children playing
                 under the table... Remember, when
                 you came to New York. You didn't
                 belong there. I didn't want to be
                 with you then, I don't want to be
                 with you now! I want you to leave!
                 I'm not going anywhere with you! I
                 want you to stay out of my life!

       And she turns away from him again...It's dead still...
       and we look at her staring at the curtains... And after
       some moments she turns back to look at Benjamin... And
       there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze...
       Benjamin is gone...

       room... Caroline behind her... times her pulse.

                 Let's get you comfortable.

       covers...she stops before she leaves...motions to
       Caroline...Caroline going over to her.

       and leaves...Caroline stands, her arms protectively
       across her chest, watching her mother...Daisy hums the
       particular ragtime song that Benjamin would play on the

                 life... about people... about
                 home... until I fall asleep.

       She looks at Caroline as if to say, "What happened to
       him...?"

                         (reading)
                    He said, "I went back..." But then
                    there are a whole lot of pages
                    torn out...

       She looks at a loose piece of paper...

                                  CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                    "...I listened to the sound of the
                    house..." I think I already read
                    that...
                         (looking)
                    The next thing he wrote... he
                    spilled something on it... It's
                    hard to read... Something about
                    "sailing." Does that make sense?

                                  DAISY
                         (in her own reality)
                    A man would go up and clean it.
                    Try and fix what was broken.

198    INT. THE TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS- DAY, 1960                 198

       A man up on the clock doing just that. Closing its face.
       The cherubic angels pushing the hands on its way
       backwards... "1960."

199    EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - ANOTHER DAY, 1960         199

       We see a SAILBOAT out on the lake...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
                    I learned to sail on an old boat
                    of my father's from the Lake
                    House...

       And we see Benjamin, the wind in his hair, sailing an old
       sailboat... And the change in his appearance is
       startling... His hair is without a trace of gray... His
       face with barely a wrinkle, chiseled...He is a healthy
       man in his 40s now...

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I can't lie, I did enjoy the
                    company of a woman or two...

                                                                   137.



200    EXT. A NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT                       200

       Benjamin and a Woman standing on the sidewalk outside a
       restaurant, in the middle of an ardent kiss... As a taxi
       pulls up...

200A   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - DAYBREAK                         200A

       Benjamin at the door kissing another Woman
       goodbye...going home

200B   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ANOTHER           200B
       MORNING, 1960

       Benjamin's door opening...Another Woman, disheveled,
       coming out of his room...

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                 ...Or maybe three...

       Benjamin seeing her to the stairs...And as she starts
       down the stairs to leave...we see a cluster of old
       people, ready for the day, looking up at them...the woman
       making her way awkwardly down the stairs and out the
       door...Benjamin gives a little self conscious wave to the
       old timers and starts back into his room...He slows at a
       second story hallway window...looking outside at the
       walkway...the familiar street beyond...If we didn't know
       any better he seems to be waiting for someone to come
       home

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                 And in the spring of 1962...

201    EXT. THE STREET, BY NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962      201

       We see Benjamin riding the old motorcycle along the
       street on his way home... leaves the motorcycle out in
       front...

202    EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962                 202

       He comes to the gate, opening it, coming into the yard,
       shutting the gate behind him, going up the walkway. An
       Old Man is on the porch, quietly rocking. And Queenie,
       for some reason is standing just outside the front door
       on the porch... an apron in her hands... She nods to
       Benjamin... talking to the Old Man in the rocking
       chair... but she seems to be watching Benjamin, as he
       walks around the house -- to the back door. He takes off
       his dirty work boots, leaves them on the porch.

202   CONTINUED:                                                        202

      He hops the back steps, and starts to open the kitchen
      door, when it opens... And DAISY, now 36, but still with
      her unmistakable blue eyes, is standing before him...

                                    BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She came back.

      They look at each other in silence...and they simply
      smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing
      years... They embrace...for some time... and kiss... As
      people who haven't seen each other, and have thought
      about each other... for a very long time... And it just
      is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two
      people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives...
      and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and
      breaks your heart.

203   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962                  203

      A radio plays... they sit at the kitchen table, eating
      dinner... the conversation muted... They don't know
      really where to begin, where did they leave oft...so they
      don't begin until they can....

                                 DAISY
                   Don't you want to know where I've
                   been?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   No. I don't care where you've been
                   -- I'm just happy you're back.

      And we see Queenie has come into the kitchen... in her
      nightgown now...

                                  QUEENIE
                         (pure Queenie)
                   How come you didn't write or
                   nothin'? Just disappearing like
                   that?

                                 DAISY
                   It was what I needed to do for
                   myself.

                                 QUEENIE
                   I never took you to be selfish. I
                   hope I'm not wrong. I'm not
                   usually wrong about people.

      And Queenie leaves the kitchen...

                                 DAISY
                   She's still taking care of you.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                   139.

203   CONTINUED:                                                   203

      Benjamin slightly smiles. They look at each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're not talking. You haven't
                   said more than two words to me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I don't want to ruin it...

      And they sit quietly in the kitchen, looking at each
      other, silently eating...

204   INT. BACK STAIRWAY - NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962          204

      Benjamin carries her bags upstairs. They reach the third
      floor.

205   INT. HALLWAY, NOLAN HOUSE - 3RD FLOOR - THAT NIGHT, 1962     205

      All the years seem to surround them. They walk along the
      corridor to Daisy's room. What was her grandmother's
      room. She opens the door.

206   INT. THE BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962             206

      He sets her bags down. Queenie despite her reservations
      has left some clean towels on the bed for her... There's
      an inept quiet. The two of them with nothing left to
      say... And they listen to the quiet... The house with its
      symphony of night noises...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight.

      He is just at the door... when she says...

                                    DAISY
                   Sleep with me.

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Are you sure?

                                    DAISY
                   Yes.

      He turns to her. They look at each other. And they kiss,
      A kiss that has waited for thirty years. A kiss that has
      waited a lifetime. And yes, there is passion... and
      need... but most particularly, the awkwardness of people
      discovering each other for the first time... While he
      gently, tenderly, kisses her, undresses her..

206   CONTINUED:                                                     206

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure you don't want to
                   know?...

      While they kiss and caress each other.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I lived in Lyon...

      Benjamin and Daisy undressing one another, touching,
      kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I learned to walk again

      Daisy and Benjamin, naked, passionately kissing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I worked in a flower shop...

      They lay on the bed, kissing, caressing...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   ...I went to American movies a
                   lot.

      They kiss more and more passionately...And Benjamin about
      to make love to her hesitates...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You won't hurt me...

      He kisses her scarred crooked leg. Kisses her body.     And
      as they make love in the old bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I asked her to come with me...

      What follows feels like a HOME MOVIE...without any sound.

207   EXT. THE FLORIDA GULF COAST - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                207

      And we see the small sailboat out on the gulf coast...

                                 BENJAMIN SUTTON'S (V.0,)
                   We sailed into the Gulf... along
                   the Florida coast...

208   EXT. THE FLORIDA COAST, A COVE - DAY, 1963                     208

      Daisy and Benjamin on the sailboat at a cove on the
      Florida coast. They watch a ROCKET, soaring into space
      from Cape Caniveral.

      As they watch it roar overhead, Benjamin marvels at its
      power...leaving its trail across the sky...Daisy, not so
      much interested, taking his arm, taking him back down
      below...

209   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - DAY, 1963                   209

      Daisy washing her hair off the side of the boat.

210   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - NIGHT                       210

      The boat anchored. Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the
      deck having a picnic with just a single lamp for light.

211   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN, ANOTHER COVE - NIGHT, 1963                 211

      The boat in still another cove. Daisy and Benjamin in
      the water. Just their eyes above the dark water looking
      only at each other.

212   EXT. THE BOAT - CARIBBEAN -    NIGHT, 1963                     212

      Under millions of stars. Benjamin and Daisy making love

214   EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                         214

      The boat out on the water, Daisy sitting on the deck, the
      wind in her hair... Benjamin at the wheel...threatening
      clouds on the horizon...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I'm so glad we didn't find one
                   another when I was 26... I'm glad
                   we missed...

                                 BENJAMIN'S (V.0.)
                   Why do you say that?

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   It wasn't right...

215   INT. A CARIBBEAN HOTEL, BAR - DAY, 1963                        215

      A small Caribbean hotel. We see Benjamin and Daisy
      sitting at a table drinking, talking in a nearly empty
      bar... wind and rain lashing the hotel... waiting out a
      tropical storm...

                                 DAISY
                   We wouldn't have this... We
                   wouldn't be here... It happened
                   when it was supposed to happen...

      They look at each other...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Relationships have a time and a
                   place.

                                 DAISY
                   Don't say that.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   What I mean is... You don't
                   usually get more than one chance.
                   If you miss it, it's too late...
                   and it's gone... We're lucky... we
                   had more than one chance.

                                 DAISY
                        (laughs)
                   That's easy for you to say...
                   You'll have plenty of chances.

      She tenderly touches his hand... They look at each
      other... And dedicating herself...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm going to enjoy every moment I
                   have with you...

      The waiter's come over.

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Have you ever had a Sazerac with
                   whiskey not brandy?

                                 DAISY'S
                        (smiles)
                   I'm with you, aren't I?   I'll try
                   anything.

      And the wind changes direction, the rain coming in
      through the open windows of the bar, getting them wet...
      people run for cover...

                                 DAISY
                   Bet I can stay out here longer

                                 BENJAMIN
                Bet you can't.

      And as they both sit doggedly in the rain...

216   INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CARIBBEAN HOTEL - NIGHT, 1963           216

      A white hotel room... The storm shutters closed... The
      wind and the rain banging at the shutters... Daisy and
      Benjamin lying together on a bed out of the storm... She
      touches his face as if for the first time...

                              DAISY
                You barely have a line, a crease,
                or a wrinkle... Everyday I have
                more wrinkles you have less...

      He touches her face.

                              BENJAMIN
                I love your wrinkles.

                              DAISY
                What does it feel like growing
                younger?

                              BENJAMIN
                I don't know... I'm always looking
                out of my own eyes...

      They're quiet, just the sound of the rain and the
      chattering shutters... She lays closer to him...
      warmly... She smiles...

                              DAISY
                Will you still love me when I
                can't stand straight... when my
                skin grows old and spotted...

      Benjamin laughs.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                Will you still love me when my
                step gets slow... when I sleep too
                much... when you have to push me
                in a chair...

      And his answer is...

                              BENJAMIN
                Will you still love me when I have
                pimples. When I think it's funny
                to make fart noises...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                  144.

216   CONTINUED:                                                  216

      She laughs...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Will you still love me when I
                   think all girls have cooties...
                   Will you still love me when I wet
                   my bed at night... Will you still
                   love me when I'm afraid of things
                   that aren't real...

      They hold each other... And Benjamin says... from what
      he's seen...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Nothing lasts...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe some things last...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I've never seen anything not come
                   to an end...

                                 DAISY
                   Maybe it's something you can't
                   see...

      And a shutter slams open... the rain and the wind coming
      into the room... Benjamin gets up to close it... He comes
      back into bed... And Daisy, suddenly afraid...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm cold, Benjamin...

      And as he holds her in the white room with the wind and
      the rain trying to get in, banging on the shutters...

217   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT, 1963 217

      The storm's died down... Benjamin and Daisy falling
      asleep...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And you said...

                                 DAISY
                   Goodnight, Benjamin.

                                   BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And I said...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Goodnight, Daisy...

                                                                  145.



218   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          218

                              DAISY
                     (that she's stopped)
                Caroline?

                              CAROLINE
                     (after a beat,
                      slightly confused)
                I don't understand. When did you
                meet Dad?

                              DAISY
                Dear Robert... some time after
                that...

                              CAROLINE
                Did you ever tell him about this
                Benjamin?

                              DAISY
                He knew enough. He loved me as I
                was. I loved him for who he was.
                What more was needed?

      She trails off... she's quiet... and wanting to know
      what's next, reading on...

                              CAROLINE
                "That night, in the Caribbean I
                had a visitor..."

219   INT. HOTEL ROOM, CARIBBEAN HOTEL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT, 1963    219

      Benjamin and Daisy sleeping... the shutters quietly
      talking on a breeze... when one of the shutters SLAMS
      open as if somebody's come in... Benjamin wakes up... And
      he literally sees QUEENIE is sitting on the side of the
      bed beside him...

                              QUEENIE
                I wanted to tell you I love you
                and your mama's gone...

      And she bends, sweetly kissing him...

      And Benjamin rolls over... His eyes come open... Daisy
      sensing he's awake, awakening, murmurs...




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                  146.

                                 DAISY
                   Is anything wrong?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   Queenie came to tell me she loved
                   me... and that my mother was gone.

                                 DAISY
                   ...go back to sleep...

      As she caresses him... falling back to sleep... the
      shutters talking...

220   EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       220

      We see Daisy and Benjamin, with their few belongings,
      returning home... They go up the walkway... Benjamin
      trots up the steps, opens the screen door and goes
      inside...

221   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1963       221

      Benjamin comes inside... Daisy's just behind him... The
      front room is empty... The house still...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (calls)
                   Hello... Queenie... we're back...

      He looks into the parlor... The piano... He goes down a
      hallway into the kitchen...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Queenie...?   Mama?

      Nobody... He goes down the hall looking in Queenie's
      small room under the stairs... Nobody's there... He moves
      back into the front room... calling...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Hello... Anybody here?

      When finally an old Woman, who's been sleeping, comes out
      of her bedroom...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   It's Benjamin, Mrs. Carter...
                   Where is everybody?

                                 THE OLD WOMAN
                   Benjamin... your mother died.

                                                                   147.



222   INT. A BLACK BAPTIST CHURCH, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963         222

      The church crowded... And we see Benjamin and Daisy
      coming in the back as the service is ending... They are
      the only white people there. Benjamin walks to the open
      casket... standing by his mother's side as the choir
      sings a Hallelujah chorus...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We buried her beside her beloved
                Mr. Weathers...

223   EXT. AN OLD NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1963                 223

      A predominantly African-American cemetery... overgrown
      and old... The mourners, almost all of them old white
      people, standing at Queenie's gravesite alongside her
      beloved Mr. Weathers. We see Queenie's daughter among
      the mourners... in her early 30s herself now... And
      Benjamin, standing over his mother's grave... saying his
      goodbyes...

                              BENJAMIN
                We are meant to lose the people we
                love. It's how we know how
                important they are to us.

                              BENJAMIN'S (V.O.)
                And so we could have memories of
                our own I sold my Father's house
                on Blaine Street...

224   EXT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, GARDEN DISTRICT - DAY, 1963           224

      The old house, in a now decaying New Orleans
      neighborhood... but despite the faltering area, the house
      retains a dignity of its own...

225   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                    225

      We see a young pregnant Woman, a renter, being shown by
      Benjamin along with a Real Estate Agent, around the old
      house.

                              THE WOMAN
                ...It's such a lovely place... You
                must have a lot of fond memories.
                It must be hard for you to give it
                up.

      Benjamin doesn't say anything. There's a knock on the
      door. Benjamin opens it, to let an OLDER MAN in... quite
      a bit older...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                148.

225   CONTINUED:                                                225

                                 THE MAN
                   Is Mrs. Williamson here yet... I'm
                   sorry to be late...

      And he sees his wife... pleased to see her... hugging
      her... tenderly kissing her... and their age difference
      readily obvious... Benjamin acutely aware of it...

                                 THE WOMAN
                   It's a wonderful old place,
                   darling... I think we will be so
                   happy here...

      They go into the hallway lined with the family
      photographs... She's taken by them...

                                 THE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                   Oh, what a long family history you
                   have...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   They come with the house...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   And we bought a house of our
                   own...

226   EXT. A SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963        226

      Benjamin and Daisy sitting on the front steps of a
      suburban New Orleans townhouse, a small screened front
      porch with a tree in front...

227   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT            227

                                 DAISY
                        (murmurs)
                   I loved that house... it smelled
                   like firewood... The chimney
                   leaked smoke... We didn't care...
                   Oh don't stop dear... don't
                   stop...

      She closes her eyes...

                                  CAROLINE'S VOICE (OVER)
                   "It was one of the happiest times
                   of my life..."

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   We had no furniture to speak of...
                   we would have picnics in the
                   living room...

                                                                    149.



228   INT. THE SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1963          228

      Benjamin and Daisy having a picnic on the virtually empty
      living room floor.

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0,)
                We slept on a mattress...

229   INT. BEDROOM, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS DAY, 1963       229

      We see Benjamin and Daisy sleeping on a mattress on the
      floor in the bedroom...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                We vowed never to go to bed or
                wake up at the same time. We
                lived on that mattress...

      And we see just that, a short film of two people who
      can't get enough of each other living on a mattress...
      Daisy and Benjamin at various times, while they are
      either sleeping, or talking, or eating, or reading, or
      making love, ON THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a
                physical therapist...

230   INT. PORCH, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1953       230

      We see Daisy in the screened-in front porch, exercising
      her leg under the supervision of an older woman... MRS.
      VAN DAM...

                              BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                We lived four blocks from a public
                pool...

231   INT. A PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL, YWCA - DAY, 1963                 231

      We see Daisy in a bathing suit, resting from swimming,
      holding on to the side of the pool, watching a young,
      well conditioned girl, 18, with nothing but her life
      ahead of her, completely in tune with her body, swimming
      laps... And as it comes to all of us, painfully aware of
      the years passing, her own physical mortality, she starts
      to cry... And we see that Benjamin, come to meet her, is
      standing above her.

                              BENJAMIN
                You're crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

231   CONTINUED:                                                      231

                                 DAISY
                   It's just the chlorine...

      Looking at the young girl... looking at her...
      understanding...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You chose something to do...
                   something so special... so
                   unique... there was such a short
                   period of time that you could do
                   it... Even if nothing had happened
                   ... Sooner or later you would be
                   in the same place you are now...

      She's quiet... she knows what he's saying is true...

                                 DAISY
                   I don't like getting old.

232   EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - DAYBREAK, 1964             232

      Benjamin, Daisy holding onto him, riding the old
      motorcycle along the lake...

233   EXT. THE DOCK AT THE LAKE - DAYBREAK, 1964                      233

      Daisy sits in the familiar deck chair his father had sat
      in looking out at the lake... Benjamin brings her a cup
      of coffee... He sits on the deck on his heels beside
      her...

                                 DAISY
                   I promise you, I'll never lose
                   myself to self-pity again...

      And as they watch the day begin...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   And I think, right there and then,
                   she realized none of us is perfect
                   forever.

234   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          234

      The window has started to rattle again... the wind
      knocking.

                                 CAROLINE
                   I thought the wind had shifted
                   away...

      Daisy doesn't say anything, lying still, staring off...
      her breathing shallow, laboring...

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   Mother?

                                 DAISY
                        (agitated)
                   I don't remember if I turned the
                   lights off. Did I leave the
                   heater on?

      The Nurse, on her way by, seeing her distress... coming
      in...

                                 THE NURSE
                   Let's get you comfortable...

      She gently covers her... Daisy quietly lies back...

                                 THE NURSE (CONT'D)
                   She's getting ready to leave...

      She looks at Caroline and turns and leaves the room.
      Caroline quietly looks at her mother. Their eyes meet.

                                 DAISY
                   You have the most beautiful eyes.

      Caroline reaches to hold her thin hand. Daisy says
      something to herself. Caroline looks at her...she looks
      down at the book...

                                 CAROLINE
                   He said, "She found peace."

                                 DAISY
                        (says to herself)
                   Peace.

235   INT. A DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1967                   235

      A small dance studio... a scratchy phonograph record
      playing music... young girls learning how to dance...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   She opened a dance studio...

      And we see Daisy, in a long skirt over a long sleeved
      leotard... wearing slippers...




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                      152.

      The first time we've seen her dressed like this in many a
      year... happily teaching young girls how to dance...

236   INT. DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1967                    236

      We see Daisy alone... cleaning up... music playing on the
      record player... and for a brief moment she stops, and
      dances... the smallest, most tentative of steps... she
      sees in the studio's mirrors Benjamin's been silently
      watching her...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You're still beautiful to watch...

      She looks at herself in the dance mirror... just what
      happens...

                                 DAISY
                   Dancing is all about the line...
                   the line of your body...after
                   awhile... you lose the line... and
                   you can never get it back...

      They look at each other in the mirror...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I figured out if you were born in
                   1918... 49 years ago... I'm 43...
                   we're almost the same age... In
                   three years we'll meet in the
                   middle...

      And what she doesn't say, what they both know, is she's
      going one way and he's going the other...Benjamin
      affectionately...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        (smiles)
                   We finally caught up to each
                   other...

      She smiles, starts to turn...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   Stay just like that... I want to
                   remember what we look like right
                   now.

      They stay like that for a moment longer... She turns to
      get her things... She shuts off the lights... She takes
      his arm...



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                 DAISY
                   I thought I was far too old... I'm
                   pregnant...

      He stops... They look at each other, she smiles, nodding
      "yes," it's true. And deeply moved he takes her in his
      arms... grateful...touching her face... holding her...

237   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              237

                        (stopped)
                   You were pregnant? You never said
                   anything, did you? I mean, what
                   happened to the child?

                                 DAISY
                        (wistful)
                   The child...

      We're not sure what more she is about to say, her
      breathing rasps... she's having some difficulty
      breathing...


                                 CAROLINE
                        (getting up)
                   They said if you needed oxygen...

                                 DAISY
                   I want to breathe on my own...
                   Please...(and) sit down, my
                   darling...

      Caroline respects her wishes...

      And Caroline wanting to know what happened herself...

                   "She flourished..."

                   I thought I heard the nurse slip,
                   and say "he..."

      As they ride Benjamin looks over watching a father
      sitting with his child... Daisy notices his look...

      Daisy with a hot Fudge sundae and a tuna sandwich...
      Benjamin just some coffee... They're quiet... And Daisy
      says...

                              DAISY
                I know you're afraid.

                              BENJAMIN
                I'm not hiding it.

                               DAISY
                Okay.   What's your worst fear?

                              BENJAMIN
                What if it has...what if its like
                me?...

                              DAISY
                Then we'll love it all the more...

                              BENJAMIN
                I want to be father... not a
                little brother... I don't want to
                be picked up from elementary
                school by my kid... I don't want
                anyone babysitting me...

                              DAISY
                I'm going to make this work...
                This is what I want, and I want it
                with you...

                              BENJAMIN
                You know, there's nothing I
                wouldn't do for you...

                              DAISY
                Would you tell a blind man he
                can't have children? You will be
                a father for as long as you can.
                I know the consequences. I
                accepted that. Your love, loving
                you, is worth everything to me.

      He smiles... She gets up and goes to the restroom. He
      sits with his thoughts... and he notices a television's
      on... a news report... something catches his eye...
      someone swimming? He gets up moving to the television...
      where he hears...

                   The oldest woman to ever swim the
                   English Channel arrived in Calais
                   today... having made the swim in
                   thirty-four hours, twenty-two
                   minutes and fourteen seconds...
                   the sixty-eight year old
                   Englishwoman, Elizabeth Abbott...

      And we see dear ELIZABETH ABBOTT, coming out of the
      water, completing the English Channel swim.

                   Anything's possible.

      And as she smiles, after a lifetime of waiting,
      triumphant... And Benjamin smiles for her, and for
      himself, too... where anything is possible... Daisy's
      come beside him...

                   Yes.

      He leaves some money. He takes her arm... and as they go
      outside, moving along the street...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

      Paramedics are there... tending to Daisy, Benjamin at her

243   INT. THEIR BEDROOM - SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - DAY, 1968               243

      We see, lying on Daisy's chest, is a newborn baby...
      Benjamin, standing beside her... And a young Woman Doctor
      that's there... packing up her things...

                   You're sure there's nothing wrong

                   She's a normal, healthy baby in
                   every way...

      her...

                   Benjamin was my father?

                    It doesn't change for a moment who
                    you are. You were a gift.
                    Sometimes the gifts we are given
                    are not free.

                                  CAROLINE
                    You never said a word to me...

       Caroline, upset, gets up...

                    I need to go for a minute...

       She leaves the room...

                    My dearest darling, we were both
                    deprived of him...

       Daisy lying still... in her turban... her blue eyes...
       her breathing rasping...

244A   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT          244A

       Caroline stands in the hall. The bustle of the hospital,
       the exigencies of life going on about her. The Nurse,
       seeing her...

                                  THE NURSE
                    It can get to you...

       And Caroline, unable to hold it in, can't stop bitter
       tears from running down her face... The Nurse is called
       for... She goes off down the hallway... Caroline takes
       another moment and goes back into the hospital room...

244B   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          244B

       Daisy, seeing her come back in...

                    I was worried you weren't coming

       Caroline hesitates, then sits back down, and quietly
       takes up the "book."

245    INT. THEIR BEDROOM, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS -        245
       NIGHT, 1969

       The room's dark. We see Benjamin in bed, the baby
       sleeping between him and Daisy... And as Benjamin watches
       them sleep... he looks at his reflection in a wall
       mirror... his 51st year on this earth... 34 years old...
       a young man... He looks at his baby... he looks at
       Daisy... in her mid 40s... her hair's begun to gray...
       her face begun to show the natural touches of age... His
       stare awakens her... She looks at him sensing he's deeply
       troubled... He shuts his eyes... she watches him sleep,
       Daisy as troubled as he is... but for very different
       reasons...

246    EXT. A PARK - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969                        246

       Benjamin is sitting with Caroline while she plays in a
       park's sand box... Caroline helping herself to a mouthful
       of sand... Benjamin, trying to get the sand out of her
       mouth...

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Don't eat sand...

       Daisy comes over to sit with them...

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                    She's going to have a really
                    attractive diaper.

       As they sit watching Caroline playing in the sand...

                   I think you should find a real
                   father for her...

                                 DAISY
                   What are you talking about?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs someone to grow old
                   with...

                                 DAISY
                   She'll learn to accept whatever
                   happens... She loves you...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   She needs a father not a playmate.

                                 DAISY
                   Is it that my age is starting to
                   show...? Is that what you are
                   telling me? Have you lost your
                   desire for me...?

                                 BENJAMIN
                   You don't need another child to
                   raise...

                                 DAISY
                   You're going to leave me, aren't
                   you?

      He doesn't say anything.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't leave me.

      He's silent.

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You can't do this to me...!

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   It was your first birthday. We
                   had a party... the house was
                   filled with people...

                                                                   159.



247    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969           247

       The birthday party. A cake with a big number "1" candle.
       One-year-olds not having a clue.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                 The fathers and mothers were
                 there...

       He looks at the age appropriate mothers and fathers with
       their children...

                               A MAN
                 Before you look around they'll be
                 in High School dating.

       Benjamin manages a smile.

                 I remember your first birthday
                 like it was yesterday.

248    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATER IN THE DAY, 1969            248

       The house is empty, the guests gone... Daisy busy
       cleaning up from the party. She stops to look outside,
       at the backyard. Benjamin is sitting on a lounge
       chair... the baby, in her party dress, sitting on his
       chest... As Daisy stands at the window watching him with
       their baby...

249    INT. THEIR BEDROOM - SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT,    249
       1969

       Benjamin, dressed, watching Caroline in her crib, asleep.
       Daisy in bed, asleep.

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                 I sold the summer house on Lake
                 Pontchartrain... I sold my share
                 of Button's Buttons... I sold the
                 sailboat... I put it all into an
                 account for your mother... And
                 before you would ever remember
                 me...

       And he bends to kiss his sleeping daughter, whispering to
       her...

                               BENJAMIN
                 I want you to know I love you...

      He stops to put a bank book on the dresser, along with a
      house key... the sound of the key is just enough for
      Daisy to stir. He starts to leave... He turns to go...
      and he sees Daisy is looking at him... A look not so much
      of anger, or hurt, not of resignation, but a look of
      acceptance... that this is what her life is now... He
      crosses out of the dark room silently closing the door
      behind him...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.)
                   I left, so that you and your
                   mother could have a life.

250   EXT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1969              250

      He takes the old motorcycle out of the garage.

                         (after a beat)
                   I left with just the clothes on my
                   back.

      He starts the motorcycle, and with just the shirt on his
      back he rides away...

251   INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT,           251
      1969

      Daisy still lying in bed, the sound of the motorcycle
      driving away. She gets up. She takes the baby out of
      her crib and into bed with her, holding her baby in the
      bare light...

252   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              252

      Daisy, in her regal turban, silently looking out the
      window... the wind knocking loudly again...

                   I almost wish I didn't know any of
                   this.
                         (she's quiet, after a
                          beat)
                   I feel odd, reading...it...

      She looks at the book...

                   I don't know.    I never heard from
                   him.

      Caroline, distant, picks through the book...She comes
      upon...

                                 CAROLINE
                   There are postcards...

      Looking through them...

                   They're all addressed to me...
                   They're from all sorts of

      And she realizes...

                   They're for my birthday.

                   Nothing I ever did will replace
                   that..."

      Daisy murmurs... Which brings Caroline back to the

       And Benjamin's voice comes in... WHILE WE SEE HIM IN
       VARIOUS PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD, A MONTAGE, A FILM
       WITHIN A FILM, OF THE ROAD HE'S TAKEN...

                               BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                 "...What I think is, it's never
                 too late...or, in my case, too
                 early, to be whoever you want to
                 be...There's no time limit, start
                 anytime you want...change or stay
                 the same...there aren't any
                 rules...We can make the best or
                 worst of it...I hope you make the
                 best...I hope you see things that
                 startle you. Feel things you
                 never felt before. I hope you
                 meet people who have a different
                 point of view. I hope you
                 challenge yourself. I hope you
                 stumble, and pick yourself up. I
                 hope you live the life you wanted
                 to...and if you haven't, I hope
                 you start all over again."

263    INT. THE DANCE STUDIO, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER NIGHT, 1980    263

       A record's playing piano music. Classes are done.
       Parents taking their children. We see Daisy, in her long
       skirt... helping pick up with her hands and her nimble
       toes, errant clothing, the jackets, the sweaters...




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                    165.

      It takes us a moment to recognize her... in the some
      twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her
      hair's cut short... and it's gone mostly gray... and,
      although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's
      posture, her head held high... carrying herself with
      grace... and one thing that will never change, are her
      unforgettable blue eyes... We hear the door opening...
      Daisy, busy gathering, saying her goodnights... glances
      toward the door across the studio... And she sees a young
      Man has come in, a young man in his twenties... standing
      silently, a stranger, standing by the door... Daisy, as
      she closes up the studio, makes her way toward him,
      saying goodnight to people... she bends to pick up a
      ballet slipper...

                                 DAISY
                   Somebody left their slipper...

      Daisy looks over, the young Man hasn't moved... the
      studio has all but emptied... she walks toward him...
      he's wearing worn trousers, a coat that's seen better
      days...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you here to pick someone up?

      He shakes "no." Coming closer....

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I'm sorry, we're closed now.

      She moves to open the door to show him out... when she
      gets a good look at him. She stops, realizing who it
      is...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin?

      ...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are...
      sixteen years younger... in his 20s now... it's at once
      staggering and heartbreaking... what age can do... And
      she realizes, at that very moment, he was right all
      along...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   You're so young.

      They look at each other... When she's able to find the
      words...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Why did you come back?


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                   166.

                              BENJAMIN
                I wanted to see you both.

      She stares at him... just the piano music. And despite
      the gulf of time... there's a terrible aching they have
      for each other... and before they can say anything... the
      door swings open and Caroline, 12, comes hurrying in...

                              CAROLINE
                You ready, Mom?

      Benjamin stares at her appearance... And Daisy, can't
      help herself, and seeing Caroline, Daisy, overcome by it
      all, starts to cry.

                              CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                Is something wrong, Mother?

                              DAISY
                No... He was telling me a very sad
                story about a mutual friend we
                hadn't seen in a long time... This
                is my friend, Benjamin... you knew
                him when you were... just a
                baby...

                              CAROLINE
                Hi...

                              BENJAMIN
                Hello...

      He reaches, taking her hand... needing to touch her...

                              A MAN'S    (V.O.)
                Hello...

      And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in...

                              THE MAN
                I'm sorry... I thought you were
                done...

                              DAISY
                This is a friend of my family's...
                Benjamin Button... this is my
                husband... Robert...

      They shake hands... There's an awkward quiet...

                              ROBERT
                It was nice to have met you...
                We'll be in the car, darling...

                              DAISY
                I'm just closing up...

      And Robert and Caroline go outside to wait for her...

                              BENJAMIN
                She's so lovely... she looks like
                you... Does she dance?

                                 DAISY
                Not very well.

                              BENJAMIN
                I suppose that would be from my
                side of things.

                              `DAISY
                She's a dear sweet girl... she
                seems a little lost... But who
                isn't a little lost at 12?
                There's a lot of her that reminds
                me of you.

      And she shuts off a set of the lights.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                My husband. He's a doctor... was
                a widower... He's an incredibly
                bright, adventurous man...

      Benjamin smiles.

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                He's been a terrific father... and
                a great partner and friend...

      And she shuts off the record player and another set of
      lights... and for a moment they stand in the dark
      studio... and they look at their reflections in the
      mirror... seeing who they are now...

                              DAISY (CONT'D)
                You're so much younger.

                              BENJAMIN
                Just what you can see.

      She looks at him, and after all these years... she now
      understands completely... she looks outside at her
      daughter standing by the car with her "father,"
      waiting...

                               DAISY
                 You ware right. She needed a
                 father. I couldn't have raised
                 both of you. I'm not that strong.

      He's quiet.   They both are.   She looks at him.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 I never thought how it must have
                 broken your heart, too.

      His silence is enough.

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 Where are you staying? What are
                 you going to do?

                               BENJAMIN
                 I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on
                 the avenue. I have no idea what
                 I'm going to do.

      And it seems like they want to hold each other. But they
      can't. It's still. And aware of the car's headlights
      waiting at the curb... she turns, holding the door open
      for him...

                                 DAISY
                 I have to go.

      He nods.   He walks by her, going out.

264   EXT. A STREET, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980                         264

      She stops to lock the door. She turns, getting into the
      car... and leaves... Benjamin stands on the corner, hands
      in his pockets, the car driving by him... and Daisy can't
      help but look at him... and then the car's gone... and as
      he crosses the street and walks off into the night...

265   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT               265

                   Is there anything we need to do?

                                 THE NURSE
                   Arrangements are being made to
                   move people if we have to. I'll
                   let you know as soon as we know
                   anything.

      She leaves hurriedly.

                                 DAISY
                   Please tell me what he says?

      Caroline looks at the book.       And Benjamin's voice comes
      in...

                                 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                   "That night..."

266   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980            266

      Benjamin, sitting on the end of the bed, not sure why he
      came there at all... There's a sound at the door...as if
      somebody was there...

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Hello?

      Its quiet...a hesitancy...He starts to get up and there's
      a knock on the door...He opens it...and Daisy's there.
      He's startled to see her...

                                    DAISY
                   May I come in?

                                    BENJAMIN
                   Please...

      She comes inside...an awkward quiet...

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
                   I don't know what I'm doing
                   here...What I expected...?

      It echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not
      knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly...

                                    DAISY
                   Nothing lasts.

      He puts a finger to her lips. He shakes "no."       And what
      he's come to know, that some things do last...

                                 BENJAMIN
                   I never once stopped loving you...

      He affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead...

                                 DAISY
                   I'm an old woman now, Benjamin.

      And he helps her off with her coat... She's still.

                                   DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Benjamin...

      He kisses her... and she's quiet... and he undresses
      her... undressing himself... and they stand momentarily
      naked... the young man and the older woman.

                                   DAISY (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure?

                   Some things you don't ever
                   forget... the feel... the taste...

      And he kisses her again...

                   ... the smell...

                   ... the touch...

                   Of someone you love...

      We see Benjamin standing at the window watching as Daisy
      gets into a taxi... the taxi starting to drive off... and
      Daisy turning... to look back... waving to him. Benjamin
      waving to her... what they both somehow know, is a last
      goodbye...

      ...the taxi going down the street and out of sight... for
      the last time... Despite losing sight of her he still
      hasn't moved... standing by the window...

268   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT             268

      Daisy, breath raspy, sitting silently in her bed looking
      out the window... We realize Caroline's stopped
      reading...

                                    DAISY
                   Please read...

                   That's the last thing he wrote...

      Daisy's quiet... they both are... alone with their

                   What happened to him after that
                   last time with you, Mother?

      The wind has picked up considerably, rattling the window
      even harder..

                                 DAISY
                   Hello?... Yes?... Speaking -- I
                   don't understand? Where was that?

270   INT. A TAXI, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990                       270

      We see Daisy riding in the back or a taxi.

                                 DAISY
                   It's the last house...

      She looks outside, and we see up ahead of her, the Nolan
      House standing like a monument to time...

271   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE - DAY, 1990                             271

      Daisy gets out. The taxi drives off. Daisy stops for a
      moment before she opens the gate. The house has fallen
      into disrepair. A solitary old man sits on the porch
      rocking and rocking. She goes up the walk and out of
      habit goes around the back porch... to the kitchen...
      going inside...

272   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 1990                               272

      She comes into the kitchen. She moves down the hallway
      into the living room... The interior has also fallen on
      hard times. Some old people are still in residence --
      predominantly African Americans now... Queenie's
      daughter, now in her fifties herself, stands in the
      living room... Along with a plain Man in a plain suit...

                                  DAISY
                   I'm Daisy...

      The Man turns...

                                 THE MAN
                   Thank you for coming... I'm David
                   Hernandez with the Orleans Parish
                   department of Child Welfare
                   Services.

      Queenie's daughter turns on a lamp... it doesn't work...
      she crosses the room to turn on another...

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   He was found living in a condemned
                   building off of east Lamont... the
                   police found this with him... this
                   address... and your name...

      And he gives her the journal...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                      173.

272   CONTINUED:                                                      272

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   He was in very poor health... he
                   was taken to the hospital... He
                   doesn't seem to know who or where
                   he is... He's very confused... The
                   doctors who looked at him think he
                   may be autistic.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   I told Mr. Hernandez about
                   Benjamin bein' one of us. I told
                   him if he needs a place to stay...
                   it's alright... he can stay
                   here... he is blood after all...

      And just then we hear a PIANO playing... as if it were
      being played by a child... with no skill... banging as
      much as anything... And Daisy follows the sound of the
      piano into the parlor...

273   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1990                            273

      And she sees his back... just a boy of 12 now... hunched
      over... trying to play the piano... trying to play the
      tune the woman had taught to him...

                                 DAISY
                   Benjamin.

      He turns at the sound of her voice. There is no
      indication he recognizes her at all.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Do you know this song?

      And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is
      nothing more than a child playing random notes.

                                 DAISY
                   You play really beautifully.

      She comes and touches his back... He shrinks from her
      touch.

                                 THE MAN
                   He doesn't seem to like to be
                   touched.

      And while he tries to play...

                                                                      174.

273   CONTINUED:                                                      273

                                 THE MAN (CONT'D)
                   The doctors said if they didn't
                   know any better, he goes in and
                   out of states of recognition, as
                   if he had the beginnings of
                   dementia...

      Daisy's looking at the boy, who was once the man she
      loved... who she still loves... She looks into his
      eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   Do you remember me?   I'm Daisy.

      He looks at her.    No sense of recognition.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   Daisy is a very pretty name. I'm
                   Benjamin.

                                 DAISY
                   It's good to meet you Benjamin.
                   Do you mind if I sit with you? I
                   would love to hear you play.

      He doesn't say anything. She sits down beside him on the
      piano bench. He stops to look at her.

                                 BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
                   There's something about you...
                   There's something about your eyes
                   I remember from a long time ago...

      He looks at her eyes. She looks at him... And as she
      sits with him on the piano bench... as he tries to
      play... Daisy and Benjamin, "together again..."

274   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              274

                                 DAISY
                   Queenie's daughter saw to it that
                   he was taken care of...

275   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1994                   275

      And we see Benjamin, just eight now... coming into the
      kitchen... Queenie's daughter cleaning up after
      breakfast.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   I want some breakfast.

                                                                       175.

275   CONTINUED:                                                       275

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   You just ate breakfast.

                                    BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   No I didn't...

                                 AN OLD WOMAN
                   You just finished eating, Mr.
                   Button.

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                   You think I don't know what you
                   are doing?

      And like an eight year old, or an old man old with onset
      Alzheimer's -- which makes him nearly a helpless child,
      he starts to rage... throwing things...

                                 BENJAMIN AT EIGHT (CONT'D)
                   You are all fucking liars!

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   And every day I would stop by...
                   and make sure he was
                   comfortable...

      And just then Daisy comes into the kitchen.       She sees him
      raging.

                                 QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER
                   He doesn't believe he's already
                   had his breakfast.

                                 DAISY
                   Let's see if we can find something
                   else for you to do.

                                  BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                         (upset, meaning
                          lapses)
                   I can't help it. I can't help
                   this.

                                 DAISY
                   I know you can't.

      And as she puts her arm around him, taking him out of the
      room, understanding...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   Many times he would simply forget
                   who and where he was at all...

                                                                   176.



276   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY                      276

      We see Daisy sitting on a bed with Benjamin in his room
      on the second floor of the old house... And he's oddly
      lucid...more articulate than his age would indicate...

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                I get the feeling there's a lot of
                things I can't remember...

                              DAISY
                What do you mean?

                              BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
                It's like there's this whole life
                I had and I can't remember what it
                was...

      He's frustrated by it...

                              DAISY
                It's alright... It's alright to
                forget things...

      And as she sits on his bed with him... in the upstairs
      room...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                It wasn't easy...

277   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1996                                 277

      And we see Benjamin, no more than six now, standing on
      the ROOF... Daisy standing on the ground down below
      him...

                              DAISY
                     (nervous)
                I wish you'd come down...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX
                     (a little boy)
                I can see everything.

      And he points out...

                              BENJAMIN AT SIX (CONT'D)
                I can see the big river... all the
                boats... I can see the graveyard
                where mama's buried and all those
                other people... I can see the
                city... where you have your
                dancing place...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                      177.

277   CONTINUED:                                                      277

      And tears fill Daisy's eyes...

                                 DAISY
                   You're right, you can see
                   everything sweetheart...

      And he can... he can see all the way across to the
      Mississippi River... the old graveyard... the city... his
      whole life...

                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                   I think you better come down...

                                 BENJAMIN AT SIX
                   What if I could fly?

      And it looks like he might just try...

                                 DAISY
                        (stopping him)
                   I knew a man who could fly. Come
                   down and I'll tell you all about
                   him.

      He's quiet, thinking about that. And acquiescing, he
      turns up the roof out of sight... some short
      moments...and he comes running out the front door... his
      hands in his pockets like the brave little man he is...
      Daisy bends down... and as he runs into her arms... Daisy
      holding him...

278   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              278

      Daisy propped in her bed looking out the window...

                                 DAISY
                   And I went to take care of him...

279   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1997                                    279

      And we see Daisy, in her seventies now, carrying a
      suitcase, coming up the walkway, and onto the porch...
      old people sitting in the porch chairs...

                                  DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   He was five, I think, when I moved
                   in... the same age I was when I
                   had met him...

      And we see Benjamin, 5 now, sitting on the porch swing,
      staring off... and he drools like a helpless old man.
      Daisy stops, taking out a handkerchief, wiping the drool
      off his chin...

      Daisy, unpacking her suitcase with Benjamin's help,
      taking out an alarm clock, a quilt, some photographs...
      The "Just So Book.." Her personal things... moving in...
      Benjamin, playing with the alarm clock, making the alarm
      go off... again, and again...

281   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1997                 281

      Benjamin in a small child's bed. Daisy, sitting on his

                   This is the picture of old Man

                   when he got his beautiful hind
                   legs just as Big God Ngong had
                   promised.

      And we see Benjamin, just three or so now, holding
      Daisy's hand, walking with her in some autumn leaves...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.)
                   I watched as he forgot how to

284   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, FALL, 2001            284

      And we see him, just like a toddler, barely able to
      stand... Daisy there to catch him from falling...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                I watched him sleep...

285   EXT. PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 2002                      285

      Daisy, sitting on the porch on a rocking chair. Benjamin,
      just a baby now, some months old, sleeping in her lap...

                              DAISY'S (V.0,)
                In 2002, they put a new clock on
                the train station wall...

286   INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY 2002                    286

      And we see a workman on a ladder taking down the old
      clock of "Mr. Cake's"... handing it down to another
      workman...and putting up a new clock... a digital
      clock... The time moving... the way it's meant to be...
      going forward...

287   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT            287

      Daisy in her hospital bed... the wind howling at the
      window...

                              DAISY
                In the spring of 2003...

288   INT. BENJAMIN AND DAISY'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 2003       288

      Shadows dapple the room. Daisy sitting in    an old chair
      in the middle of the room... with daylight   streaming in
      on her... holding Benjamin on her lap... a   tiny thing
      now... nearly newborn... he can almost fit   in her two old
      hands...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.)
                He looked at me...

      And we see him looking up at her...

                              DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                He looked into my eyes...

      And we see him looking into her eyes...

                   with his little thumb he held my
                   thumb...

      ...and that's just what he does... looking into Daisy's
      eyes...holding her thumb with his tiny hand...

                                 DAISY'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   And as he had said... no matter
                   what age he was... he was the same
                   person behind his eyes... and, at
                   that moment I knew... he knew who
                   I was...

      The baby staring into her blue eyes...

                   And then he closed his eyes like
                   he was sleeping...

      And we see his eyes flutter and softly close... forever.
      And as he lays in his beloved Daisy's lap... completely
      still...

289   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              289

      The wind a full out hurricane.    The lights flicker.   Stay
      on.

                                 CAROLINE
                   I'm going to see what they want us
                   to do...

      And as she gets up, the "book" drops on the floor.      And a
      card's fallen out. Caroline picks it up.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   It's a train schedule.

      She turns it over.    There's writing.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                   "I'm on a train in India filled
                   with people."

290   INT. A TRAIN SOMEWHERE IN INDIA - LATE AT NIGHT                 290

      An overcrowded train car... people sitting and standing
      and lying on the seats and on the floor, in every
      available space, nook and cranny, asleep.

                   I'm the only one who isn't
                   sleeping...

      Now we see Benjamin sitting on the floor among all of the
      people, the only one awake, writing on the back of the
      train schedule.

                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D)
                   "I figured out one thing. If

                   younger it really doesn't make any
                   difference. Whichever way you're
                   going you have to make the most of
                   what this is."

      He looks at all the people sleeping around him...
      strangers on a train...

      She gently puts the card back.

                   planning to do...

      Daisy nods. Caroline goes out of the room... It's quiet.
      Daisy's alone now... looking out the window... at the
      howling, hurricane... a hundred mile an hour fury... And
      fighting against the wind, trying to reach the window is
      a hummingbird... it almost makes it and is pushed back by
      the gale... but undaunted, its wings doing a figure
      eight... the symbol for infinity... it fights its way
      through the wind to the window... tapping at the
      window... and the hummingbird flies away... she watches
      it go... and after some moments she says...

                                 DAISY
                   Goodnight, Benjamin...

      it's dark... where it's peaceful, even safe...

      A storage room. Old track signs. Old waiting room
      chairs. The discarded, and forgotten. And lying on its

          FADE IN:

          INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes
          sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.
          In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his
          mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of
          WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he
          finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA
          FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.

                         PHIL
          Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the
          one who told me not to mess up the
          precious picture piles!
          he gives him a long, slow kiss.

          PHIL (CONT ' D )
          Minty fresh.

                         CLARA
          That was nice.

                         PHIL
          It was nice.

                         CLARA
          Hey from now on when you change the
          toilet paper, could you just make sure it
          is out?

                         PHIL

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's
          over!

                         CLARA
          Oh, believe me, we're just getting
          started, Phil.

                         PHIL
          (reaches into picture pile)
          Look at this one of your Mom with me. I
          mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!

          ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands
          stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle
          deep in a manure bin.

                         CLARA

                         (LAUGHS)
          She just takes a while to warm up. You
          guys are gonna be best buddies. You
          picked a favorite of us yet?  

                         

          2.
          Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          That's exactly the one I picked!

          Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.
          It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look
          joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front
          of them.

                         PHIL
          Man, I wish I was them.
          Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades
          as she stares at the picture. He notices.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

                         WHAT IS

                         CLARA
          I just... when I was growing up my Mom
          and Dad had a picture just like this.
          Now they can't even acknowledge each
          other.
          Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Let's always remember to have some time
          that's just for the two of us. No matter
          what else comes up in our lives - if it's
          work or friends or when we have kids-

                         PHIL
          We're having kids? With an "S"?

                         (CLARA LAUGHS)
          OK fine. But I promise you it's never
          gonna happen to us.

                         CLARA
          Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that
          when I'm long in the tooth.

                         PHIL
          You'll be even hotter long toothed.
          Right now to be honest Clara they're a
          little stumpy.

                         CZ

                         (GIGGLES
          Oh really?
          As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and
          turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of
          pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.

                         PHIL
          wasn't the pictures.

                         CLARA
          You know how long that took?

                         PHIL
          We'll fix the picture piles, Clara.
          We've got all the time in the world.
          From now on everything's gonna be just
          about us.
          Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.

          OLLIE (V.0.)

          MOM!
          The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING

          Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an
          ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.

                          E

          OLLIE (O.S.)
          Mo-om!
          It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan
          in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER
          while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a
          T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each
          side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite
          directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the
          hall and Phil to the bathroom.

          OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Mom! Mom! Mom!

                         CLARA
          I'm coming, Ollie!

          INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's
          bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil
          showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the
          doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack
          of PAPERS in his hand.

                         CLARA
          Uh Phil?

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.

                         PHIL
          Yep?

                         CLARA
          I need to switch. I've got an open
          house.
          Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but
          contains it.

                         PHIL
          Really?

                         CLARA
          Yeah. Really.
          As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands
          together.

                         PHIL
          OK, so I say today we go for the slacker
          look - cool yet approachable.

                         OLLIE
          Yeah, well Mom says that.
          Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.

                         PHIL
          Oh. Well... that's cool too!

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME

          The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly
          through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin
          SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.
          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then
          stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing
          a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.
          As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as
          well.

                         CLARA
          Ech. Mine.
          She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of
          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.
          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to
          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and
          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5
          Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the
          holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.
          As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad

          NT. KITCHEN
          Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as
          Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits
          at the table. Phil finally notices.

                         PHIL
          What?

                         OLLIE
          Breakfast?

                         PHIL

                         (HOPPING UP)
          Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob
          today. What's it gonna be?
          Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign
          of his tom.

                         OLLIE
          How about... some Captain Crunch?
          Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.

                         PHIL

          Captain Crunch?The cereal?

                         PHIL
          Uh... yeah. Sure.
          Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
          cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed
          in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.

                         CLARA
          Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a
          bowl yesterday.

                         IE
          But Dad already said yeah sure.
          Clara glances at Phil.

          A week.

                         PHIL
          One bowl a day a week.
          Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already
          in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          This is not for you today!

                         CLARA

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Yeah right.

                         PHIL

                         (SHRUGS)
          Worth a try.

                         CLARA
          Did you get his lunch together?

                         PHIL
          Oh. Whoops.

                         CLARA

                         (SIGHS)
          You just get his breakfast and I'll do
          it.
          As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie
          and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking
          back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the
          phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He
          stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly
          returning the carton to the fridge.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but
          I'll be there as soon as I can.

                         PHIL
          Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this
          Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today.
          You know how he freaks me out with all of
          his mixed animal metaphors that I don't

                         UNDERSTAND-

                         CLARA
          (focusing on Ollie's lunch)
          Ollie, do you want a banana?

          Did you hear me?

                         CLARA
          (not looking at him)
          Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed
          animal metaphors that you don't
          understand. Banana Ollie?

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          So I should probably get going. With the
          highway construction it takes forever to
          get downtown these days.

                         CLARA
          OK. Have a good day.
          Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
          off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly
          kisses Phil on the cheek.

          CLL. -- (CONT ' D )
          Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.

                         PHIL
          Sorry for the milky mouth.
          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1
          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,
          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her
          head, she tosses the carton in the trash.

          EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
          a newspaper off his lawn.

          CHAZ (O.S.)
          Well, well! We're up bright and early,
          aren't we!

                         PHIL
          Yes we are!
          (under his breath)
          ike you say to me every morning.
          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'
          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING
          STUCK halfway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         8

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

          OW! OW! OW!
          Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and
          peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.
          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger
          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
          front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear
          and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's
          seat.

          HONKING.

          EXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER

          The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD
          CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of
          it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his
          window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in
          slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR

          DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR
          HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his
          watch.

          EXT. STREET


                         E
          Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her
          30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW
          SIGNS on the sidewalk.

                         JANE
          His name's Juan and he's some kind of
          Spanish, I think. He knows all these
          exclusive, underground places downtown.
          It's so exciting. And in bed...

                         (WHISPERS)
          I never knew I could still get my leg
          back that far.

                         CLARA
          Too much information, Jane.

          INT. OPEN HOUSE

          Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each
          move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,
          cleaning and inspecting.
          The divorce was the best thing that ever
          happened to me. Seriously. You know
          that great nervous feeling in your
          stomach? Where you don't know what's
          going to happen next?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9
          On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on
          the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out
          a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a
          SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she
          passes.

          JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          With Larry, I lost that. Everything had
          just become routine, you know? Boring.
          Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through
          the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a
          weird, loud buzzing noise.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!

                         CLARA
          Good for you, Jane.
          Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki
          the side and silencing it.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Good for you.

          T. FRONT HALLWAY - A LITTLE L
           Clara and Jane sit on the floor, together
          prospectuses.

                         JANE
          There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we
          went to the ot__ar night that you guys
          would love. _"st amazing view of the
          city. You guys should check it out on
          your next date night.

                         CLARA
          (focusing on stapling)
          Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have
          those that much anymore.

                         JANE
          't have date nights:

                         CLARA
          (shrugs),
          You know, we're pretty tired all the time
          between work and Ollie. And some of the
          shows on TV these days are really great.
          Ah. I see.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         1Ï¿½1
          They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look
          at each other.

                         CLAM
          I know that's really lame.

                         JANE
          So it's Phil?

                         CLARA

                         (SIGHS)
          No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us.
          I don't know. It just... happened.

                         JANE
          So why don't you change it? All you have
          to do is stir things up and have one
          great, sexy, exciting night again.

                         CLARA
          I guess. Maybe.

                         JANE
          Not maybe. Tonight.

                         CLARA
          Nah. Tonight's no good.

                         Â¢

                         JANE
          Why not? Seriously think about it.
          What's really gonna be more important
          tonight than that?
          Clara takes this in. Jane's right.

          INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE

          Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes
          through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile
          Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS
          scream out their orders.

          the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's,
          GEORGE, quietly goes through a binder with MR. RIVERS,
          60, at the older man's desk. As Phil bursts in they both
          look over.

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on
          the highways is insane these days!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          MR. RIVERS
          Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine.
          Catch your breath.
          George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then
          heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods
          back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch
          into his report.

          MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)
          Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start...
          I've been thinking... this next quarter
          we need to venture into open tundra.
          Start really ripping the meat.

                         PHIL
          (beat, trying to decipher)
          Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a
          more high risk direction?

          MR.
          Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid.
          Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some
          higher risk options and come back
          tomorrow.

                         Â¢

          MR. RIVERS

                         (CLEARS THROAT)
          OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want
          George to give me his thoughts on where
          we need to be hunting too.

                         PHIL
          Oh.

          MR. RIVERS
          s nothing personal.

                         (BEAT)
          So let me get this straight. You're
          telling me that tomorrow I'm going to
          have to interview for the job I already
          have? Against George?

          MR. RIVERS
          I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need
          our pack leader to be more like... like a
          momma kangaroo. Ya get me?

                         PHIL
          Kinda.

                         (BEAT)
          Actually, no. Not really at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          MR. RIVERS
          The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth
          and knows its momma's teat is just always
          there, ready to suckle. But at the same
          time, momma kangaroo's still a wild,
          dangerous creature.

                         PHIL
          Sorry. Still not totally getting you.

          MR. RIVERS
          I've had a wife and a family. Three of
          them. It's hard to stay the fastest
          cheetah when you need to mind the pack,
          Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't
          have a family to worry about. He can rip
          the meat.

                         PHIL
          Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to...
          I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat
          and eating them like tartare when George
          was still... in the jungle!

          MR. RIVERS

                         (BEAT)
          What does that mean?

                         PHIL
          I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just
          can't.

          MR. RIVERS
          Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta
          say that lately your leadership on this
          has felt a little... well... tame.

                         PHIL

                         (GETTING UP)
          That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers!
          I'll see you tomorrow.
          Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.

                         SCHOOL
          Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from
          school.

                         CLARA
           So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our
          reservation's at 7:45.
          She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a
          Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and
          hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini-
          bottle of Purell and cleans her hands.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.

          FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Mrs. Foster?
          Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned
          MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot.

                         CLARA
          Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you
          later.
          Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a
          warm smile.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          I've been meaning to tell you that you
          can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries
          matter.

                         CLARA 1Ï¿½1

          OK...

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          Can we speak a moment? Alone?

                         CLARA
          Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car.
          As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Is everything OK?

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been
          antagonizing the girls in the class a
          great deal lately. Especially Jenny
          Diggs.

                         CLARA
          Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's
          happening?

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          I'm going to leave that to you and your
          nd to figure out. But beyond that,
          ,i: overall attitude these days is
          just... sub par. E

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)
          His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks
          motivation and tries to just "get by" o
          assignments. You know, this is a very
          competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my
          opinion, maybe you should consider
          whether this is really the right
          environment for him.

                         CLARA
          (beat, stunned)
          Uh... wow. OK.
          Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car,
          watching Mrs. Cardigan.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          (under her breath)
          Wow. What a bitch.

                         OLLIE
          Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?

                         CLARA
          (remembering Ollie's in the

                         BACK)
          No.

                         OL LIE
          Yeah you did.

                         Â¢

                         CLARA
          I didn't. I really didn't.
          Clara quickly pulls out.

          CAR PORT - LATER
          Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full
          of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he spots the
          TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes
          his head.

                         PHIL
          Unbelievable!

          INT. OLLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Still carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who
          packs a suitcase.

                         PHIL
          Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta
          tell you it's about time.

                         OLLIE

                         0
          I'm going to Nana's tonight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         PHIL
          On a school night? Why?

                         OLLIE

                         (SHRUGS)
          Mom says you guys are going out.

                         PHIL
          Tonight? What? No.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Clara?

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Phil marches into the bedroom.

                         PHIL
          Clara? Cl-
          He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an
          evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara
          looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Wow. Wow.
          Clara tns and smiles.

                          IS

                         CLARA
          I thought I could take you out to
          celebrate you finally getting that report
          in. A romantic dinner downtown like the
          old days, and teen...
          (raises :,er eyebrows)
           Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have
           the house all to ourselves. All night.

                         PHIL
          Wow... It sounds... great.

                         CLARA
          Great!
          She turns back and continues getting ready.

                         PHIL
          It's just... is there any chance we coul
          take a rain check?

                         CLARA

                         (TURNS)
          A "rain check"?

                         PHIL
          Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do
          a bit of work tonight. E

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         CLARA
          I thought all the cramming was for this
          report today. Did something go wrong?

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just
          decided I could play with it a little
          more. Make it a little better.
          Clara takes him in a moment.

                         CLARA
          Oh. OK.
          Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry
          back in the case.

                         PHIL
          Listen, I'm sorry...

                         CLARA
          You don't need to apologize, Phil.

                         PHIL
          Listen, if I had more warning-

                         E C
          Then something else would have come up.
          You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We
          used to do things on the spur of the
          moment all the time. Even after Ollie
          was born. Now we never do anything
          together.
          They stare at each other, then Phil breaks

                         PHIL
          Listen... any other night.

                         CLARA
          OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get
          out of this and call my Mom then.
          As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her,
          feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around
          the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their
          romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his
          hand and sucks in, conflicted.

          INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

          As Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past
          her, humming to himself. She looks over to see him
          choosing a tie and jacket from his side. Clara looks
          him, still unsure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         PHIL
          That dress really wasn't playing fair,
          Clara.
          With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Well get a move on, girl!
          She zips her dress back up.

          A DOORBELL RINGS.

          INT. RUTH'S FRONT DOOR

          RUTH, Clara's mother, opens her front door and brightens.

                         RUTH
          (to Clara and Ollie)
          Hey sweeties.

                         (SUDDENLY COLD)
          Phil.

                         PHIL
          Ruth.

                         RUTH
          Nana rented us a special treat tonight
          before bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz!

          PHIL,
          Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don't you think
          that's a little scary for a 5 year old?

                         RUTH
          (not looking at him)
          No, Phil, I don't.

                         PHIL
          OK... not so sure about that.

                         RUTH

                         PHIL
          Clara? What do you think?

                         RUTH
          (putting her pressure on)
          Yeah, Clara. What do you think?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE

          Phil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door
          towards Phil's car.

                         CLARA
          I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's
          doing us a favor tonight.

                         PHIL
          fine. Fine.
          oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.

                         CLARA
          You know, I should pee before we go.

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          OK. Sure.
          As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in
          the driver's seat.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          I'll just wait in the car as you go back
          E inside to pee. Again.

          EXT. EISENHOWER PARKWAY - SUNSET

          As the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in BUMPER TO BUMPER
          TRAFFIC. It extends for MILES toward the center of the
          city.

          CAR - S
          Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents.

                         PHIL
          You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor
          Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways
          to get reelected, but all everyone's
          going to remember when it's time to vote
          is all this mess.

                         CLARA
          You're hot?

          Yeah. That's why I turned on the air.

          Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes AIR to
          GUST out of Phil's vents, into his face. He glances at
          Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the
          air.

          You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today
          that Ollie's been antagonizing his
          daughter.

                         PHIL
          Antagonizing? How does a five year old
          "antagonize?" I'm sure she wouldn't have
          mentioned it if it wasn't "the Mayor's
          daughter."

                         CL
          She also went on that Ollie's
          penmanship's sloppy and he's not
          motivated enough.

          He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,,
          not responding - a response in itself. He sucks in.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          I think he's fine.

                         CLARA
          She actually had the gall to suggest we
          should think about sending him somewhere
          else.

                         PHIL
          Maybe she's right if the school has that
          kind of attitude.
          Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a
          breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil's
          hair.

                         CL RA
          You know what? All we ever end up
          talking about is Ollie or work. Let's

          Right now? Traffic.

                         CLARA
          Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable
          story from Jane today.

                         PHIL
          Yeah?

                         CLARA
          She has this old classmate who went into
          labor with her second child the other
          day. She's totally healthy and
          everything's normal with the pregnancy.
          So she goes into labor and walks into the
          emergency room, and the second the nurses
          and attendants see her come in, they go
          into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!

          AMA!

                         PHIL
          What's AMA?

                         PHIL
          That's unbelievable!

                         CLARA

          Beat. Clara looks out the window.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          The funny thing is she's my age,
          actually.
          Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible
          ulterior motive.

                         PHIL
          Huh.

          Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's
          thinking. A bit flustered, she opens her vents again.
          Phil looks over at her.

                         PHIL (CONIT'B)
          I thought you were cold.

                         CLARA
          I was, but then you turned it down and I
          got hot.

                         PHIL
          But I turned it down because... you see
          when you open and close your vents it
          makes my... never mind.
          Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping
          his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up,
          suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding
          toward the exit.

                         CL AAA
          What are you doing?

                         PHIL
          I'm just gonna take a shortcut.

                         CLARA
          Phil, please don't. You think they're
          shortcuts but they always take longer.
          And we're already-

                         PHIL
          Clara, please just trust me, OK
          They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated,
          Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST
          OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just
          leaves it blowing on him as they drive.

          INT. THE SIGNATURE ROOM

          Phil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the
          Signature Restaurant on the 95t Flcor of the John
          Hancock Center, with dramatic s- Lng views over
          skyline of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.

                         PHIL
          I promise you it wouldn't have been any
          faster. I promise!
          OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we're
          here? I'm gonna go pee.

          What?

                         PHIL
          Nothing.
          As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his
          way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL HOSTESS.

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          Good evening. Welcome to the Signature
          Room.

                         PHIL
          Thanks. The name is Foster.

          Foster... Oh, I'm sorry. We just had
          give away your table.

                         PHIL
          You gave away our table? We're just ten
          minutes late!

                         (STUNNED)
          OK. But don't you guys have, like, some
          kind of grace period or something?

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          have an eight minute grace period.

                         PHIL
          You have an eight minute grace period?
          How did you come up with an eight minute
          grace period?

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS

                         (SHRUGS)
          I just work here,

                         PHIL
          So what if someone's 9 minutes late?

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          We're allowed to give a two minute grace
          on the grace.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         PHIL
          OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're
          11 minutes late. That's just one minute
          later than the grace on the grace.

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          I'm sorry sir, but management
          specifically said no grace on the grace
          on the grace. After ten minutes, we send
          a host around calling your name and if
          there's no answer, we give the table
          away. Sorry.

                         PHIL
          So how long's the wait for another table?

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          Well, let's see...
          Phil looks on as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger
          down a LONG LIST OF WRITE-IN NAMES. As she turns to the
          next page...

                         PHIL
          Oh boy.

          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Even the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago. As
          Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a NERVOUS
          YOUNG WOMAN washing her face over and over.
          A knock and a SLICK LOOKING MAN quickly peeks his head in
          the Women's room.

          SLICK LOOKING MAN
          We've gotta leave now.

                         (SPOTTING CLARA)
          Whoops. Sorry.

                         CLARA
          It's OK.
          The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the
          Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her
          hands.

          INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Clara finds Phil at the bar, downing handfuls of peanuts.

                          CLARA
          How lc= -until they seat us?

          reservation. Peanut?

                         CLARA
          What?!? Did you tell them that we hit
          traffic?

                         PHIL
          They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call
          your name at the bar and you don't
          answer, they give your table away. So
          how about a nut?
          A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar.

                         YOUNG HOST

          GALE PARTY?
          Clara sighs, frustrated.

                         CLARA
          I mean, did you try something like
          telling her it was our anniversary, or my
          birthday, or slipping her some money-

                         PHIL
          Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the
          answer!
          Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST
          searching for the party and starts focusing on him
          instead of Phil as she thinks.

                         YOUNG HOST

          GALE PARTY?

                         PHIL
          I'm sure if you had been there instead of
          peeing again you would have done it
          better.

                         YOUNG HOST

                         CLARA
          (repeats, still watching)
          Yeah I am. You're sure if I had been
          there instead of peeing again I would
          have done it better.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         25
          Clara, Just because you can repeat the
          words I say doesn't mean you're-

                         YOUNG HOST

          LAST CALL! GALE-

                         CLARA
          Sorry! We're right here!

                         PHIL
          Wait. What are you doing?

                         CLARA
          Shhh!
          The Young Host approaches.

                         YOUNG HOST
          Gale party of three?

                         CLARA
          The third's running a little
          going to start without them.

                         YOUNG HOST
          eat. Follow me.
          Phil shoots Clara a look, but she ignores it. He falls
          into line after her as she follows the Young Host to th
          restaurant.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SIGNATURE ROOM - MOMENTS LA

          See? Was that so hard to do, Phil?
          bad to be the Gales, eh?
          Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the
          restaurant.

                         CLARA (CONT'B)

          What?

                         CLARA
          It's just... I don't know. You used to
          be the one who would think up stuff like
          this all the time.
          This hits Phil. He takes in his wife reading the menu
          for a beat.

                         PHIL
          You know what? You're absolutely right.
          Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for
          what feels like the first time tonight.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Mrs. Gale.

          It's OK, Mr. Gale. And might I add you
          look very handsome tonight?

                         PHIL
          You're not looking too shabby yours
          Mrs. Gale.

           GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
          Mr. Gale?
          They turn, surprised, to see TWO BURLY MEN in suits at
          their table. The Older of the two politely speaks to
          them.

          OLDER BURLY MAN
          We need to have a word with you both.

                         CLARA
          What's this about?

          OLDER BURLY MAN
          k you know what this is about.
          you could please come with us.

                         PHIL N
          Why can't we talk here? u

          OLDER BURLY 'MAN
          (beat, smiles)
          I think it would save everyone a lot of
          embarrassment.
          (gestures with hand)
          Please...
          The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara's chair to pull
          it out. Getting up, Phil shoots Clara an "I told you so"
          look as he follows the older Burly Man through the
          restaurant toward the kitchen doors, the Younger Burly
          Man walking behind them with Clara.

          INT. BACK KITCHEN AREA - MOMENTS LATER

          The Burly Man leads them through the kitchen. A WAITER
          stops, surprised.

                         WAITER
          Can I help you?
          OLDER s _ ï¿½'LY MAN
          Nah. We're fine Â®
          Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man
          pushes the down button. The elevator opens.

                         PHIL
          Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we
          going?

          OLDER BURLY MAN
          Get in, please.
          The Younger Burly Man coming up behind them crowds them
          into the elevator.

                         CLARA
          Hey! Jesus!
          The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes
          the G Floor then nods to his partner. They reach in
          their pockets.

                         PHIL
          Listen, this is all getting out of hand,
          OK? I admit we maybe did something a
          teeny bit wrong, but-
          Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS
          over their noses and mouths. Phil and Clara veil and
          struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT.

          E CLOSEUP ON PHIL'S NOSE
          An AMMONIA STICK waves back and forth under Phil's nose
          and he startles awake, disoriented, to see he's TIED TO A
          CHAIR in the middle of a GIGANTIC MEAT LOCKER. A VIDEO
          CAMERA on a tripod aims at their faces and across the
          room, the Younger Burly Man sorts through items from
          Clara's purse and Phil's wallet scattered all over the
          table.

                         PHIL
          Whoa. What the hell is this?
          Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older
          Burly Man waves the stick under her nose.

                         CLARA

                         (FREAKED)
          Phil?!? What's going on?

                         PHIL
          I don't know.
          A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the table

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          The chloroform may make you feel dizzy
          for a few moments, but it will go away.

          money, OK? Whatever's there, it's yours.
          We're not looking to cause problems or
          put up any kind fight. We'll just walk
          away and not report anything, OK? All we
          want is for you to let us go unharmed.

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          We need to discuss your little stunt
          tonight first, Mr. and Mrs. "Gale." Or
          should we say... what is it Harry?
          HARRY, the Younger Burly Man reads Phil and Clara's IDs,
          which he's grabbed off of them.

                         HARRY

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          You think this is a joke?
          Phil looks at the faces of the two thugs. No one's
          joking.

                         PHIL

                         (STUNNED)

          Yes. Well, I'm a little upset as well,
          Mr. Foster. And confused. It would help
          me to know why a couple like the two of
          you would try to pull something like
          this.

          Phil's now getting really annoyed.

                         PHIL
          You must be kidding! Like a million
          people don't do it every single night of
          the week! This is unbelievable! I'm
          just in shock here!
          Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled.

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          I enjoy your humor, Mr. Foster. Now why
          don't you start by telling me how you got
          into the Rainbow to set it uD-

          Photos?
          Clara figures out what's happened.

                         CLARA
          Wait a minute. I think there's been a
          really big mistake here. We're not the
          Gales.

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          know you're not the Gales.

                         PHIL
          They know we're not the Gales. Don't you
          get it!

                         CLARA
          No, Phil. I think they think we're
          actually "the Gales" who made the
          reservation tonight.

          Ohhhhhh. Oh. No. She's right. We're
          not those Gales. You've got the wrong
          people. Really.

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          Then why were you two at the Gales'
          table, Mr. Foster?

                         PHIL
          OK, listen, what happened is we lost our
          reservation and when the host came around
          yelling the Gales' name and no one
          answered, my wife said that we were them.
          I swear on my life to you that's what
          happened.

                         SPEAKEFP IC
          You're saying you just took someone
          else's reservation you didn't know?
          That's what you want me to believe?

          I know that seems really weird. Listen,
          I agree, that's what I said to her.

                         FRANK
          One problem with your story. When I came
          over to the table - and you guys were all
          alone - you were still calling each other
          Gale.

                         PHIL
          That was just... we were... no, you don't
          understand...

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          We'll need to move things along, Frank.
          With a nod, Frank reaches into his pockets, slowly taking
          out a GUN and a handful of BULLETS. He loads the gun as
          Phil and Clara watch.

                         PHIL
          Wait a minute. What's going on?

                         CLAW
          I don't t don't like
          this.
          Clicking the loaded gun, Frank and Harry both come toward
          Phil and Clara.

          If in ten seconds you don't tell us where
          the photos are, you lose a knee, Mr.
          Foster. Ten more seconds, you lose
          another. Then we go to your wife.

                         PHIL
          Please! You can't do this! We're not
          lying!

          Frank clicks the loaded gun at Phil's knee.

                         PHIL
          Oh Jesus. Don't do it!

                         SPEAKERPHONE

                         Â¢
          Everyone looks over. Phil's surprised.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          But we can't just tell you where they
          are. We have to take you to them.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - A LITTLE LATER

          In the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara
          and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who
          carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows
          them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the
          keys back to Harry.

                         FRANK
          You drive with her in front.

          No. I was just trying to keep our knees
          for the time being.

                         PHIL

                         (WHISPERS)
          Well, if we end up in that car with them
          we're as good as dead.

                         FRANK
          Quiet!

                         CLARA

                         (WHISPERS)
          Well, any time you want to help...

                         (WHISPERS)
          What's that supposed to mean?

                         FRANK
          I said quiet!
          They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing
          hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s
          weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead.

                         CLARA
          Phil?
          He drops to the ground.

                         PHIL
          Whoa.

                         CLARA
          Phil? What is it?

                         PHIL
          I'm... not feeling so great...

                         HARRY
          's wrong with him?

                         CL:

          I didn't... eat dinner and when I don't
          my blood sugar... Hypoglycemic...

                         CLARA
          You're not hypoglycemic.
          Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OF

                         PHIL
          I just can't... go any further.
          Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do.

                         HARRY
          Should we call Mr. Stockton?

                         FRANK
          Don't say his name, you idiot!

                         HARRY
          Sorry! I was just-

                         FRANK
          We'll just throw him in the back and have
          her show us.
          hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.

                         CLARA
          Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar.
          If you give it to me I can find it for
          him.
          With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages
          inside...
          and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing
          Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back
          grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a
          dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her,
          she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground,
          whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at
          Harry.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Drop the gun and the keys.

                         PHIL
          oa! Clara! No
          Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and
          grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard
          as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the
          gun.
          Harry looks at him, confused.

                         HARRY
          Ow! Why, man?

                         PHIL
          Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.

                         HARRY
          Why,

                         PHIL
          ought that's what you do when-

                         CLARA
          Phil! Just c'mon!

                         PHIL

                         USHING OFF)
          Sorry.
          Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in
          and speed away.

          PHIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          OK, let me just start from the very
          beginning...

          INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          Phil excitedly chatters next to Clara at a table in an
          interrogation room in the police station. Across the
          table, a YOUNG POLICE OFFICER takes their statement

                         PHIL
          We got to the restaurant late because we
          hit all this traffic on the highway-

                         CL AAA
          the shortcut.

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA

                         UGS)
          I just think we might have made it on
          time if we stayed on the highway. Your
          shortcuts end up being long cuts most o
          the time.

                         (BEAT)
          OK, are you going to tell the Policeman
          or and I gonna tell him?

                         CLARA
          You can tell him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PHIL
          Because you always interrupt me when I
          try to tell stories, and every time you
          do it disrupts my flow.

                         CLARA
          Fine, you tell it. I won't say another
          word.

                         PHIL
          Fine.

                         (BEAT)
          See, now I've totally lost where I was.

          CLARA AND YOUNG POLICEMAN
          You got to the restaurant late-

                         PHIT
          Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by
          the way, was a shortcut - and they gave
          away our reservation. So we were at the
          bar and the host was calling out for
          these other people over and over-

                         CLARA
          Which is what they do right before they
          cancel a reservation anyway.

                         PHIL
          I thought you said you weren't going to
          interrupt me, Clara.

                         C
          I just want him to understand we weren't
          really "stealing" someone else's

                         RESERVATI
          Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows
          raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and forth.

                         PHIL
          Do you think he really cares, Clara?
          were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and
          almost shot! I don't think he's going
          turn around and book us for reservation
          theft! Am I right?

          YOUNG POLIO OFFICER
          Please. Go on.

                         PHIL
          So all of a sudden Clara yells out that
          we're these other people.

                         YOUNG POLICEMAN

                         (SURPRISED)
          You just took someone else's reservation?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         PHIL
          Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the
          speakerphone couldn't believe it!

                         CLARA
          You two kinda bonded over that, didn't
          you?

                         PHIL
          We didn't "bond" over it. I'm just
          saying, speakerphone guy obviously
          thought it was weird to do.

          YC JG POLICEMAN
          Guys, you lost We were in the
          restaurant.

                         CLARA

                         (IGNORING HIM)
          Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's
          kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's
          weird to do so it's weird to do?

                         YOUNG POLICEMAN
          Guys?
          You're new "buddy."

                         PHIL
          Oh c'mon!
          And we found out speakerphone guy's name,
          Phil. It's Mr. Stockton.
          The Young Policeman looks up, interested.

                         OF FTCER
          Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute.
          The Officer dials an extension on the phone.

                         OFFICER C'-D)

          He hangs up.

                         OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified

                         PHIL
          Wait. So you already know about this
          guy? You know who he is?
          A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's,
          LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He
          reaches over and shakes their hands.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          How do you do. Lieutenant Manning.
          The Officer offers him his note pad.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING

                         (CONT'D)
          Nah, as long as they're here might as
          well get everything from the horse's
          mouth, right?
          As the Officer heads out of the room, Lieutenant Manning
          sidles down into his seat.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING

                         (CONT'D)
          Can I get you guys anything to drink?
          Coffee? Water? Maybe a shot or two of

                         1 1

                         PHIL
          That sounds more like

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          So why don't you tell me all about your
          incident with Mr. Stockton.

                         PHIL
          You tell it, Clara.

                         CLARA
          Oh, don't be like that, Phil. Please.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Guys... you've obviously been through
          something traumatic tonight. Thankfully
          it's over and you're both safe and sound.
          Maybe you should cut each other a little
          bit more of a break.
          Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air.
          Manning's right.

                         PHIL
          Seriously, Clara. You tell him.

                         CJ __

          He was in another room on a speakerphone
          where these guys who kidnapped us took
          us. But he was obviously the one pulling
          the strings.

                         PHIL
          Who is this Stockton guy anyway?

                         (WRITING)
          Let me fill you in on all that later.
          Now, why would he have wanted to kidnap
          you two?

                         CLARA
          Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but
          it's because we sat down at the wrong
          table tonight for dinner.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          (looks up, interest
          Really? The wrong table?

                         CLARA
          We pretended to be someone else who
          didn't show up for their reservations.
          My idea. And it turned out that these
          people must have something this Mr.
          Stockton wants.

                         1Ï¿½1

          Lieutenant looks up, interested, then writes again.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          That's all you know?
          Phil and Clara look at each other. Nod.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING-

                         (CONT'D)
          OK. I'm just confused about one thing.
          When you took this other reservation, how
          did you know for sure that the real Gales
          weren't going to show up late?

                         CLARA

                         (BEAT)
          Excuse me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ENANT MANNING
          How were you so sure the Gales weren
          going to show up if you don't know the
          at all?
          Clara looks down at the table, furrowing her brow.

                         PHIL
          Clara?

                         CLARA
          Sorry. I... I lost my train of thought.

                         PHIL
          Well, I can pick things up then.
          Phil notices Clara giving him a LOOK.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          What? Why are you looking at me like
          that?

                         CLARA
          (intensifying the look)
          I'm not looking at you like anything.
          doesn't pick up on it. Shrugs.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         PHIL
          OK, well, I had the same question for her
          when we sat down, which she thought was

                         CRAZY-
          Rubbing her forehead, Clara KICKS Phil's leg HARD under
          the table.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          OW! Jesus!
          Clara stink-eyes Phil AGAIN, trying to get the message
          across.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          And there's that look again!

          CLARE?
          look! No. Looking. At all.
          RINGING. Lieutenant Manning reaches into his jacket
          pocket and checks the number on the cellphone. He hops
          up.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Can you excuse me a moment?

          utenant Manning gets up and exits the room. Clara
          does to the window in the door and watches him walk down
          the hall to his office as he talks on the phone. Phil
          puts his leg on the table, pulling up his pant leg to
          inspect.

                         PHIL
          OK, I'm not dense, Clara. That was not
          an accident and if those weren't looks-

          contained. Right now.
          Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through
          the police station to the interview room. He stops in
          the doorway...
          .it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside
          at the desk.

          passenger seat.

                         CLARA
          We can't just go to another police
          station, Phil! We don't know how big
          this is! It might not just be Manning!

                         PHIL
          Well then we're screwed! Who do we go
          to? The FBI? The CIA?

                         CLARA

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          They're not going to believe us over a
          Police Lieutenant!

                         (REALIZING)
          Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta
          lose it too.
          Searching the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE.
          She whips the wheel around, trying to parallel park into
          the space.

          You've got it, Clara. Spin it back now!

                         CLARA
          just let me do it,
          She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Dammit! I hate this!

                         PHIL
          It's all right. You just should have
          spun it when I told you to.
          Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          rn! Quick!

                         CLARA
          Would you stop it? You're stressing me
          out!
          Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING
          the car behind them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITH

                         FLASHING LIGH`

                         Â¢
          Hearing the alarm, a LARGE MAN rushes out of a restaurant
          nearby, looking at them.

          The Large Man stomps toward them.

          Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on
          The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe
          yells after them.

          Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening
          as Ruth PICKS UP.

                         RUTH (PHONE)

          Suddenly, GUNSHOTS RING OUT over the phone.

          Feet up, Ruth eats Fiddle Waddle as she watches an action-

          another mouthful of Fiddle Fiddle.

          she won't be bothered again.

          Clara tries on her phone, then hangs up, frustrated.

          HOLBROOKE PETERSON, a thoroughbred of a man in his mid-
          30's, opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a
          smile to find Phil and Clara.

          Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same

          He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little.

          Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a
          look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke
          gestures to some cardboard furniture.

          Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show
          of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and
          putting it on the table.

          Clara's focused on Holbrooke.

          Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is
          not a man you want to get on the wrong

          Phil watches as Holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav
          around his Margarita glass with his extra long tongue.
          Clara listens intently, eating some jicama slices from a
          platter on the table in front of them.

          He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his
          head deep in his shell unless he
          absolutely has to stick it out. Those

          What does Stockton do?

                         HOLBROOKE
          Officially, he runs a bunch of these
          exclusive private clubs downtown where
          his high powered friends go to let their
          hair down. Has one place called Le

          Interesting. I've had some of my guys
          looking into Stockton for years, but
          nothing ever sticks to him. He's very
          careful - ties up his loose ends and
          covers his tracks. But with this... he
          might have accidentally left himself
          open.

          As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily
          looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes to a pile
          of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along
          with a pen.

                         HOLBROOKE
          I'll just need your full names and your
          socials so I can get the paperwork
          started at the bureau. Not yours, Clara.
          Know that by heart.
          Both Phil and Clara are taken aback.

                         HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Just kidding. But I'm sure Phil-a-buster
          knows 'em both, right?
          Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands
          him.

                         PHIL
          Uh... there's already writing all over
          this.

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (B

                         IG EYED)
          Does another tree really need to die for
          me to get your socials, Phil?
          Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing
          into a side of the paper.

                         HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)
          So just one kid, guys? What's keeping
          you? Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock
          tuck.

                         PHIL

                         (WRITING)
          Yeah, well, that's a topic for another-

                         HOLBROOKE
          It's just that by now, you and I woulda
          had a whole brood.

                         PHIL
          (under his breath)
          That's... charming.
          Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and
          dramatically turns it sideways.

           Holbrooke and Clara burst into laughter. Phil

          L.O.L,, right?
          (thinking he doesn't

                         UNDERSTAND)
          It's because you're writing's hard to
          read, Phil, and everyone knows how when
          doctors write things down-

                         PHIL
          No. Yeah. I get it.
          Holbrook. makes a big show of putting his gun back
          holster as he gets up.

                         HOLBROOKE
          We'll have you stay at the bureau for the
          night. Safer for you.

                         CLARA
          Thank you so much, Holbrooke.
          (sighs, relieved)
          I feel like we're in good hands for the E
          first time tonight.
          As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets
          out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood.

                         CLARE
          What's wrong?

                         PHIL
          I don't know. Maybe I should have had
          one of Holbrooke's eeegerag warn
          raaaarrrrghereeeeetas.

                         CLARA
          Phil's really had enough with this guy.
          Your goodness... where does it end?
          Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke
          doesn't get his sarcasm.

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (SHRUGS)
          How I roll. Now for some reason they
          wanted us to come in the back entrance.
          He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his
          shoulder strap before getting out of the car.

          INT. FBI WINDOW

          Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara
          walking toward the back of the building.
          In the foreground, A SHADOWY GUY watches them, then
          whispers into his walkie.

                         SHADOWY GUY
          Positions.

          FBI BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
          Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish
          to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and
          Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and
          Clara FREEZE behind them.
          At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in
          bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of
          them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in
          charge, yells to them.

          sudden movements. Are they armed,
          Peterson?

          Uh,

                         PHIL
          What the hell's going o

                         HOLBROOKE
          I don't know.

          Uh.. .

                         PHIL
          Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke.

                         AGENT #1
          His men?
          The Agents look at each other and chuckle.

                         AGENT #2
          What do you want us to do, Holbrooke?
          Reformat our hard drives?

                         AGENT #3
          Our badass I.T. guy!
          The laughter builds.

                         CLARA
          I. I. guy?

                         HOLBROOKE
          OK... I'm not the "I.T. guy." I help out

                         E
          with computer questions out of kindness!
          But see if that happens anymore, Harold!

                         AGENT #1
          Alright, enough. Point is, Agent
          Peterson scored tonight. When I typed in
          those socials, an APB shot up with a
          whole laundry list on these guys.

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA
          crooked cop did it! It's a lie!

                         AGENT #1
          It's your booking, Peterson. We're Just
          here to back you up.
          Holbrooke...
          Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and
          Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Listen guys. I'll just book you and then
          tomorrow we can straighten the whole-

                         CLARA
          (pulling arm away)
          What? Oh no you're not!
          Oooohs from the Agents.

                         AGENT #3
          You just gonna take that, Peterson?

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (PRESSURED)
          All right. Didn't want to have to-
          Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun...
          .but BOBBLES it and it falls to the ground, right at
          Phil's feet. Looking down, Phil instinctively GRABS IT,
          holding the gun to Holbrooke's head.

                         PHIL
          All right! Nobody move or he gets it!
          Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but
          don't seem overly concerned.

                         AGENT #1
          Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even
          â¢ have a gun?

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (TO PHIL)
          Listen, man. I'm not that important.
          I'm really not. I'm not the IT guy but
          I'm just one step above him! No reason
          to do something rash, all right?

                         AGENT #3
          You think it's even loaded?

          A` -.
          I don't.

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (FREAKED)
          loaded, guys! It's loaded!

                         PHIL
          I'm not screwing around!

                         HOLBROOKE
          He's not screwing around! He's not
          screwing around!
          Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward
          the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but
          it's locked.

          Keycard.

                         HOLBROOKE
          What?

          A FEW FBI AGENTS
          He wants your keycard.

                         PHIL
          Thanks. He and I, the communication
          isn't great...
          Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the
          keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door
          unlocks and they back outside.

          EXT. FBI BUILDING - CONT

          Phil and Clara back away, keeping Holbrooke between th
          and the agents. Through the door, Agents slowly creep
          down the hallway after them, guns trained.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I
          promise.

                         CLARA
          Wow, Phil!
          Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.

                         PHIL
          Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke.
          When we're about to drive off we'll let
          you go.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Uh, they were on the keychain.

                         PHIL
          What?
          HOLB'?n`_
          The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard
          inside. The keys were on that.
          And so the hero falls...

                         PHIL
          Shit.

                         CL AA
          we'll never outrun them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          Searching around, Phil eyes the KEYCARD PANEL outside the
          entrance. He aims the gun and FIRES, MISSING BADLY.
          Both he and Holbrooke cover their ears.

                         HOLBROOKE

          AH!

                         PHIL
          YOW! Man is that loud!
          As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs
          the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          (stunned, looks at her)
          How are you so good at that?
          The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1
          tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass,
          but it's BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the Agents
          rush around to the front.

                         CLARA
          gotta get going! Quick!

                         PHIL
          Where?
          They both look around, unsure.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Across the bridge a few blocks down that
          street there's an entrance to the Green
          Line subway. Get on it and you can get
          anywhere in this city.
          Phil and Clara look at him, confused.

                         PHIL
          Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (SIGHS)
          Whatever. I don't know. Sure. What's
          the difference? I'm never gonna get
          behind that desk now anyway.
          my gun! I dropped it in front of
          everybody!

                         PHIL
          It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more
          of a... bobble.

                         CLARA
          Yeah, a bobble's bad...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Listen, if you just leave me here I can
          tell them you ran the other way. It'll
          buy you time to get there. And maybe I
          can work on clearing all this up for you.
          Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run
          away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.

                         CLARA
          What?

                         PHIL
          Let me have the gun.
          As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and
          hands it to Holbrooke

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Here. Tell them you got it back from us.
          Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Thanks, Phil.
          As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of
          husband.

          EXT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
          A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass
          under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying
          to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil
          glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.

                         PHIL
          it's just on the other side of that
          bridge. I think we're going to make it.
          He notices Clara looking at him.

                         PHIL (COND
          What?

                         CLARA
          Nothing. That was just nice of you, back
          there.

                         (BEAT)
          This is crazy, but you know what I'm,
          reminded of right now?

                         PHIL
          Bourne identity?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         CLARA
          I'm talking about right now. When we
          used to walk home late at night after
          going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't
          ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab
          those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at
          the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler
          Planetarium to watch the sunrise.

                         PHIL
          Where I held your hand for the first
          time.

                         CLARA
          I can't believe we used to stay up all
          night like that.

                         PHIL
          It's because we could sleep 'til noon.

                         CLARA

                         (SMILES SLYLY)
          If I remember correctly, we weren't
          always "sleeping."
          Beat as they share the moment together, walking.

                         PHIL
          I just don't understand when we got so...
          I don't know...

                         CLARA
          Old.

                         PHIL
          No, I was thinking numb. When did we
          become one of those couples that we used
          to look at in restaurants back then and
          think were so sad?

                         CLARA
          We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we
          haven't been that honest with each other
          recently.
          Phil doesn't understa

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Not big things. Just little things
          keep adding up and putting this thing
          between us.

                         (BEAT)
          Like the fact I know you never want to
          talk about us having this other baby.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         PHIL
          It's not that I don't want another kid,
          Clara. It's just... I used to be the
          whole pie with you. And now with Ollie
          and your work, I'm barely even a piece of
          the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a
          pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of
          me's not jumping at the chance of having
          the little pecan I have left of your
          attention going into some new baby's
          mouth!

                         CLARA
          But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home
          you're the one who seems like your hardly
          even there! It's all about your work.
          Believe me, if you-
          Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive
          past them over the bridge.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Shit!

                         PHIL
          I think we're OK. Just play cool and
          keep walking.
          The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1ï¿½1
          Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief.
          Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The
          patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming
          back toward them.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Now you can say shit.
          Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge
          with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY
          BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath
          them.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          e 's only a few feet.

                         CLARA
          What u high? No way.
          But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them,
          Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

          AH!

                         1Ï¿½1

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the
          railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they
          DANGLE above the water and the boat.

                         CLARA (CONT'D
          Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?!

                         PHIL
          Let go, Clara!

                         CLARA
          A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them,
          cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks
          down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going
          to miss the boat.

                         PHIL
          go or I'm going to tickle you!

                         CLARA

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          No you're not, Phil. We have a rule!
          tickling. I'm not-
          He reaches up and TICKLES Clara under her arm. She
          giggles.

                         E

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

                         (LAUGHING)
          Ah! Stop it, Phil! Ah! It's not funny!
          I mean- Stop it! Ah!
          Clara can't hold on any longer...

          EXT. BOAT

          They land - THUMP! - onto the top deck of the boat, both
          groaning as they roll back and forth while the Drunken
          Partiers CHEER and FLASH PHOTOS.

                         PHIL
          Ow! I think I broke my butt.

                         CLARA
          OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule
          about tickling?

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure!
          What is our rule?

                         0

          "It's only funny if it's funny for the
          both of us."

                         CLARA
          Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny
          for me, Phil!
          Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking
          down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one
          knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting
          his proposal.

                          CLARA (CONT'D)

                          (MARCHING PAST)
          B i g mistake!
          They look at her, stunned.

          A OTHER PART OF THE BOAT - M0_,'_= -1; LATER
          Phil limps along, finally finding Clara alone and calmed
          down, looking out over the rear of the boat. He comes
          next to her. Beat.

                         PHIL

          's OK, How`s your butt?

                         PHIL
          Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a
          moving boat, not so bad.

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          I can't even fucking believe this is
          happening to us.

                         CLARA
          You know, we're kind of running ou
          ons.

                         PHIL
          Maybe we could just hide or something
          until this all blows over.

                         CLARA
          What makes you think it ever wil

                         PHIL

                         (SIGHS)
          Imagine what it's going to be like for
          Ollie when everyone hears about this
          tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going
          to be all over the papers.
          Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to
          him.

                         PHIL
          Wait. What if we found the pictures?

                         CLARA
          What do you mean?

                         PHIL
          These pictures that everyone's after.
          we could get them we'd have some kind o
          bargaining chip to get out of this.

                         CLARA
          But then we'd have to find the Gales.
          don't know anything about them.

                         PHIL

                         (THINKS)
          Except... the Rainbow.

                         CLARA

                         (CATCHING ON)
          The pictures have something to do with
          that place!

                         PHIL
          Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these
          clubs are so secret you have to know
          where they are and how to get in-
          Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone,
          dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.

                         CLARA
          What?

                         PHIL
          You're not listening to me again!

                         CLARA
          "You have to know where they are and h
          to get in-"

                         PHIL
          That's great. Clara wanna cracker?

          I'm calling because of what you said,
          Phil. I know who can help us.
          Clara dials the number.

                         CLARA_ (CONT'D)
          Hey Jane, it's Clara.

                         (LISTENS)
          Where am I?
          (beat, looks around)
          I'm... I'm on a party cruise around
          Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into
          quite a night. Listen, we need to go to
          this club called the Rainbow later. Do
          you know how we can get in?
          Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her
          ear and listens. Phil watches her until he notices the
          boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side.
          A slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara.

                         PHIL
          ara...
          Clara turns and looks.

                         CLARA
          Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've
          actually gotta jump off right now.

          INT. TOUR BOAT - LATER

          POLICE swarm all over the tour boat, checking every
          compartment. A DRUNKEN PARTIER shows Lieutenant Manning
          SNAPSHOTS of Phil and Clara landing, groaning, and
          arguing on the back of his digital camera. A POLICEMAN
          comes up to Manning and shakes his head.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Check again.
          Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away.

                         PARTIER
          Hey! That's mine, man!

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          It's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and
          slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps
          water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone.

                         CLARA
          Mine's totally shot too.

                         PHIL
          You got the info from her though, right?

                         CLARA
          Yeah, but we can't get in looking like
          this, Phil.

                         PHIL
          I don't think we have a choice. Not a
          big shopping hour.
          They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights
          blazing. Windows show machines filled with young
          HARDBODIES working out.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Now if we wanted to do a little cardio,
          on the other hand. Who knew that many
          people worked out at 1 in the morning?
          Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks
          back up at the building.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          You wanna do a little cardio?
          Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He
          shakes his head.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          OK, now that's scary. You know you're
          starting to think like a real criminal?
          You know that, don't you?
          Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's "Secret Agent
          Man" over a TrC _ GE .

          INT. 24 HOUR FITNESS CENTER - MONTAGE

          - Phil and Clara walk up to the front counter, where the
          GYM GREETER boredly watches TV. They say something and
          the Greeter waves them through without looking up. As
          they hurry on, the Greeter's TV goes to a PROMO TEASER
          for the local late night news: a SNAPSHOT of Phil and
          Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: BONNIE AND

          CLOD?!?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         1Ï¿½1
          - In the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil pulls at the COMBINATION
          LOCKS, searching for an open locker. Unable to find one,
          he picks up a bench to throw it at them when TWO JOCKS in
          workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he
          holds the bench. Phil moves the bench back and forth,
          pretending it's part of his EXERCISE ROUTINE.
          - In the WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Clara, wrapped in a towel,
          blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN
          WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile
          at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN
          disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD
          DASH for the lockers.
          - Back in the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil lingers as a MAN IN
          A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the
          man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him,
          excitedly telling him something and pointing outside.
          The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly
          undressing.
          - The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and
          opens it. Her face drops. Inside hang CL A"S DRIPPING

          CLOTHES.
          - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt
          and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then
          stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair
          blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with â¢
          RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From her expression, she feels
          the same about Phil.

          EXT. ALLEY - LATER

          Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a
          dark, derelict alley.

                         PHIL
          Down here?

                         JANE
          It's what she said.

                         PHIL
          And if you die, does Jane get your
          commissic-l on the open house?
          Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a
          bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby.
          Nervously, Clara approaches.

                         CLARA
          Excuse me?
          Men shoot her a fierce look.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Um... do you know which is the way back
          to Kansas?
          They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them
          LUNGES, and Phil jumps back...
          but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a
          RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.

                         SHADY GUY #1
          Welcome to the Rainbow.

          INT. THE RAINBOW - LATER

          Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara,
          amazed, take in THE RAINBOW.
          It's a CAVERNOUS ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION that's been
          converted into a GLAMOROUS CLUB. The place is PACKED
          with an elite looking CROWD. Everything in the room -
          the carpet, the tapestries, the clothes of the waitstaff -
          is EMERALD GREEN.
          Phil and Clara nod at each other then separate,
          disappearing into the mix.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW - SAME

          Phil looks around, amazed as he wanders between BLACKJACK
          and BACCARAT tables, where well-to-do OLDER guests gamble
          large sums of money, fast looking WOMEN cheering them on.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          If you wanner be pissed at anyone about
          it, be pissed at Stockton...
          Hearing the name, Phil spots a BALDING MAN talking to 2
          other MEN at one of the tables. He lingers closer.

                         BALDING MAN
          You know, rumor is he's behind the whole
          mess. Raking it in on both ends.
          What do you mean?

                         BALDING MAN
          Hush hush shell companies he owns. One
          of them hires all the construction
          inspectors. Another he's got rents all
          the construction equipment. The more one
          slows things down with violations,
          more the other takes to the bank.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          The Balding Man leans in and speaks more quietly, causing
          Phil to lean in even more.

          BALDING MAN (CONT'D)
          My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor
          Diggs' reelection. Imagine what someone
          like him could do if he got someone less
          "squeaky clean" in the Mansion.
          The Balding Man suddenly notices Phil listening. Phil
          pastes on an excited face.

                         PHIL
          you! Gale, right?

                         BALDING MAN
          What?

                         PHIL
          Sorry. From the side... confused you
          with somebody else.
          Phil quickly moves on.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW -

          Clara talks to a BUSY BARTENDER at the bar as he
          scrambles to fill drink orders.

          BA --Y_-_.
          really get s,-.y names.

                         CLARA
          Thanks any-way.
          With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when she

          FREEZES.
          ough the crowd, FRANK and HARRY walk right toward her -
          but they haven't seen her yet. Clara spots the KITCHEN
          DOORS nearby and rushes through.
          INT. KITCHEN - C vUOUS
          Clara peeks out through the double door windows. Frank
          and Harry continue through the crowd, unaware.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Watch it!
          Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with
          pictures and time schedules as a WAITER carries a large
          tray of food past her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          As she moves off the wall, some papers drop. Clara pins
          them back on, when something else on the bulletin board
          catches her eye...
          .Among all the snapshots of staff scattered on the
          bulletin board is a picture of a backyard party with a
          whole group of laughing young people, and the middle of
          the picture, smiling at the camera...
          . is THE NERVOUS WOMAN FROM THE SIGNATURE ROOM

          BATHROOM.
          Clara pulls the picture off the wall. She catches a
          WAITRESS coming back through the double doors.

                         CLARA
          Excuse me. Does she work here?

                         WAITRESS
          Dora? I guess she still does. Hasn't
          been showing up lately, though.

                         CLARA
          Do you know where I can find her?

                         WAITRESS
          You could try back tomorrow, see if she-

                         C
          I need to find her tonight.

                         WAITRESS
          Did you try Ray's place?

                         CLARA
          Ray?

                         WAITRESS
          That sleazebag boyfriend of hers. He's
          got that place a few blocks from here
          where he used to throw those after work
          parties.

                         CLARA
          Do you remember where it is?

          ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW
          Phil scans the crowds, back and forth.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Phil!
          Hearing his name, Phil nervously turns. MR. RIVERS and
          GEORGE stand together in a corner.

          hit.

          MR. RIVERS
          This is a surprise! What are you doing
          down here?

                         PHIL
          Uh... well, same thing as you guys, I
          would guess. Working those "extra
          hours," right?

          CLARA (O.S.)
          Phil!
          Clara, looking amazing in her red flapper dress, weeds
          through the crowd. Mr. Rivers and George take her in,
          obviously impressed.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Phil, we gotta go. I found out where-

          Clara, you remember Mr. Rivers?
          Clara suddenly notices Phil's boss.
          Oh. Oh. Yeah.

                         GEORGE
          And I'm George.

                         CLARK
          Sorry, but I've got to steal him. We've
          gotta be somewhere else right now.

          MR. RIVERS
          At 2 in the morning? Where are you guys
          headed?

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Rivers. We really can
          talk about it.
          Phil and Clara move off quickly through the crowd as Mr.
          Rivers watches the hand_ï¿½__e, dressed up couple,
          intrigued.

          MR. RIVERS
          Phil Foster with places to go he can
          talk about at 2 in the morning.

          MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)
          You know what makes kangaroos so damn
          dangerous, George? They look so sweet
          and tame, so you forget they're wild
          animals. Lethal when they want to be.
          George, not fully understanding, chuckles and holds out
          his hand for another handshake, but Mr. Rivers, still
          watching Phil, LEAVES HIM HANGING.

          A TV MONITOR IMAGE of Phil and Clara making their way
          through the crowd to the exit.
          In the dark room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the
          well dressed man in a dark suit, who absently twirls with
          two metal balls in his hand.

          MR. STOCKTON
          See where they take you.

          EXT. RUN DOWN ROW HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

          Phil and Clara knock on the door of a the deserted
          looking row house. No answer. Clara tries the door...

                         PHIL
          That never really-
          OPENS. She shoots Phil a look.

          OK. Never mind.
          Phil and Clara inch insi

          RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          As they start down the dark hallway to the living room,
          Phil hunches over, hugging the wall.

                         CLARA
          are you bent over like that?

                         PI
          sneaking.

          CLA?.A
          Rut why don't you just walk normally and
          quietly?

                         PHI
          This is the wav I sneak. You sneak in
          your way and I'll sneak in mine, OK?

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK. Fine. I was just asking.
          Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil. Reaching the
          living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES on the couch.
          Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun
          to Phil's head, DORA nervously next to him.

                         RAY
          Talk! Who are you?

                         PHIL
          You know, that's like the 5th gun I've
          had to my head tonight! Just lower that
          thing and cool it, OK?
          Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does.

                         DORA
          She was in the bathroom at the
          restaurant!

                         RAY
          Who are you?

                         PHIL
          Who are we? Good question! Well,
          everybody thinks we're "the Gales"
          because we were lucky enough to take your
          reservation tonight!

                         RAY

                         (CONFUSED)
          What? Why would you take our
          reservation?
          Phil shoots Clara a look.

                         CLARE
          Don't.

                         RAY
          Both of you. Stand ov there in the
          corner. Dammit Dora, ere's your
          goddamn brother? He was E,.--,-Dc.-zed to b
          here an hour ago!
          I don't know, Ra_, He's not answering
          his phone.

                         RAY
          Yeah, well, if these guys found u
          long do you think it's gonna take
          other guys? We're dead! DEAD!

                         CLARA
          Excuse me.
          In the corner, Clara raises her hand. Ray eyes her
          strangely.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Sorry. I have to pee.

                         RAY

                         (FLUSTERED)
          You have to nee?
          Clara nods. Phil shrugs.

                         PHIL
          That's my wife.
          Flustered, Ray waves Dora to take Clara.

          INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Dora talks to Clara as she washes her face in the sink.

                         DORA
          You must just think I'm awful.

                         CLARA
          I don't think anything about you. I just
          want this to be over.

                         DORA
          Ray saw Mr. Stockton making all this
          money blackmailing people at the club.
          When he found out who was interested in
          me... he said it would be so easy. We'd
          never have to work again.

          RAY (O.S.)

          HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PEE, GUYS?!?

                         DORA
          We're coming!

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

          Ray peeks nervously out of the window, searching the
          street.

                         PHIL
          Listen, it looks like things didn't turn
          out the way you planned, but I think all
          Stockton wants is his pictures back. As
          soon as he gets them I bet-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         RAY E
          Stockton's pictures? You.think they're
          Stockton's pictures?

                         (SMIRKS)
          You really have no idea what you've
          gotten into, do you?
          BOOM! The window SHATTERS and Ray and Phil hit the deck.
          As Ray starts blindly firing back, Phil crawls on his
          knees and elbows across the floor toward the bathroom.

          CLARA (O.S.)

          PHIL?!?!

                         PHIL
          I'm OK! I'm OK!
          Ray spots Phil crawling away and gets up, turning to him.

                         RAY
          Hey! Get-
          Suddenly, Ray is SHOT IN THE ARM through the window. He
          drops to the ground in pain, yelling and clutching his
          arm.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
          Ahh!

                         Â¢
          Phil crabs along even faster.

          INT. BATHROOM

          Clara rushes to the bathroom door, pulling Phil inside
          and locking it.
          As Clara focuses on Phil, Dora thinks fast, taking an
          ELOPE out of her purse and putting it into Clara's
          bout them seeing.

                         CLARA
          Oh God! Are you hit?

                         PHIL
          No... just... a little ... winded...
          that... crawling's... tough... on the
          core...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

          As Harry kicks the gun away from Ray, moaning on the
          floor, Frank comes to the bathroom door. He lightly raps
          on it, then speaks softly.

                         FRANK
          How about you guys let me in before
          someone gets really hurt?

          INT. BATHROOM

          Dora quickly opens the window and gestures for Phil and
          Clara to climb through. Just as they squeeze outside...
          BAM! The door handle's BLOWN OFF and Frank kicks the
          door in. He grabs Dora, rushing toward the window, but
          Phil and Clara are GONE.

                         FRANK
          Dammit!
          Frank eyes Dora, then SHOOTS HER IN THE FOOT, sending
          screaming to the ground in pain.

                         FRANK(CONT'D)
          You stay put.
          He hurries back through the house.

          FRONT OF RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          Phil and Clara sprint to the street as a BUICK pulls up
          in front and a confused looking CHUBBY GUY steps

                         CHUBBY GUY
          Hey? Which is 357 Maple Street?

                         PHIL
          You're Dora's brother?

                         CHUBBY GUY
          Who are you?

                         PHIL
          You're late!

                         CHUBBY GUY
          OK sorry! The roads are all screwed
          with all this construction-
          BOOM! They wince as a SHOT hits the rearview mirror of
          the car. All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and
          marching toward them, Harry right behind him.

          CHUBBY GUY (CONT'D)
          Hey!
          Phil quickly pushes Dora's brother aside as he and Clara
          hop into the Buick and PEEL OUT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Frank and Harry SPRINT for their Towncar down the block.

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Phil screeches the car around the corner.

                         CLARA
          Phil! Careful!
          Phil WHIPS the car around another bend.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Please, Phil! It's not going to do any
          good if you-

                         PHIL
          (taking another sharp turn)
          Clara! Please! Just leave the driving
          to me, OK?!? I know what I'm-
          SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the
          windshield.
           Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're
          face to face - nose to nose - with another broken
          windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA
          h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE â¢
          stares at them in shock.

                         BLACK DUDE
          No no no. Tell me you did not just do
          that.

                         PHIL
          Shit!
          The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in
          hands.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Oh, man! You did not just do that!
          Whew, you gonna be payin' for this!

                         PHIL
          owe you one.
          Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just
          screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place.
          Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that

          THE SMASHED FRONT GRILL OF THEIR CAR HAS INTERLOCKED WITH

          ASHED FRONT GRILL OF THE BLACK DUDE'S HONDA. _-M
          The Black Dude comes toward him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76,

                         BLACK DUDE
          Oh no no no. You're gonna get outta this
          car and hand me over a license and some
          insurance. We gonna do this right. Man,
          I think I got whiplash and shit.
          A SCREECH. Phil looks back to see FRANK AND HARRY'S
          TOTnNCAR coming around the corner.

                         PHIL
          Shit.
          Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into
          the Black Dude's souped up Honda.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Hey! HEY! What do you think you're
          doing?
          The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's
          door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.

                         PHIL

          PUT IT IN REVERSE AND GUN IT, CLARA!

                         CLARA
          What? That's insane!

                         E
          Frank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash
          into them in seconds...

                         PHIL

          I KNOW IT IS! BUT DO IT!
          Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to
          reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on
          the gas.
          The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS
          as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY
          SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The
          Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield
          into the passenger's seat next to Phil.

                         BLACK DUDE

          JESUS CHRIST! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH

          YOU?!!

                         PHIL

          NOW PUT IT IN DRIVE!

                         CLARA
          Huh?

                         BLACK DUDE

          JESUS! JESUS!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         PH IL

          PUT IT IN DRIVE NOW!

                         CLARA
          Phil, this is-

                         BLACK DUDE

          JESUS JESUS!

                         PHIL

          DO IT!
          (to Black Dude)

          AND YOU! CUT THE JESUS!
          Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps
          on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels
          smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race
          past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in
          pursuit.
          Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their
          conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and
          Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly
          back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK
          DOWN a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h--'-s v;:-reel,
          getting them back into the street.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Just let me out, OK? You can have it! 1ï¿½1
          You can have it!

                         PHIL

                         (IGNORING HIM)

          DAMMIT! TRY TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT CLARA!

                         CLARA

          STOP YELLING AT ME!

                         PHIL
          I'm not yelling! I'm just talking in an
          very animated voice!
          Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're
          approaching the lar
          ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel!

                         (BEAT)

          NOW!
          On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply to t1-
          right., but it's the wrong way and their cars JACK
          across the road. An ONCOMING SUV honks desperately.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Flustered, Clara WHIPS her wheel in the other direction,
          and their two cars tilt up on four wheels (out of eight),
          barely screeching past.
          Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots
          her a pissed off look.

                         CLARA
          What? You just said spin the wheel,
          Phil! You didn't say which way.

                         PHIL
          Yes I did!

                         CLARA
          No you didn't!

                         BLACK DUDE
          She's right! You di

                         CLARA

                         (VINDICATED)
          God! Thank you! Can we take him home?
          I need him!
          Both Phil and the Black Dude sees that the Towncar's
          turned onto Michigan Avenue and is still right behind
          E them.

                          BLACK DUD
           Aw man!

                         PHIL

                         (TO CLARA)
          I say our best chance is to reverse
          again, then use both engines to floor
          as fast as we can all the way down
          Michigan.

                         CLARA
          Why stay on Michigan?

                         PHIL
          Why stay on Michigan? Because it's a
          wider street.

                         LARA
          It's also a busier street! I think it
          would be better to try to branch off.

                         PHIL

                         (SIGHS)
          Why do you have a problem with every
          route I take?
          Flustered, Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to
          commiserate, unaware that his STEERING WHEEL DRIFTS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          She does this wherever we go! Every
          time!
          Phil doesn't notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind
          him..

                         CLARA

          PHIL!
          LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude look over
          their shoulders to see they're heading straight for a

          DELIVERY TRUCK.

          PHIL, CLARA AND BLACK DUDE

          AHHHH!
          Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go SIDEWAYS,
          jumping the curb and soaring into MILLENNIUM PARK.
          In their car following them, Frank and Harry's -mouths
          drop.

          EXT. MCCORMICK ICE RINK

          The conjoined cars sail across the
          grass and SMASH
          THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK.
          Their cars PINWHEEL OUT OF CONTROL across the ice. Phil,
          Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world
          is a SPINNING BLUR around them.
          Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings,
          Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them.
          He searches where to go next, then spots something.

                         PHIL
          Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight
          put your foot to the floor. Give it
          everything!
          Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors
          it. The car goes faster... faster...

                         BLACK
          Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that.

                         CLARA
          Doing what? What are you doing?!?
          Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai
          toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY.

          CL. (CONT'D)
          Oh God.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         PHIL
          Just trust me!
          The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE
          as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE

          STAIRWAY!
          The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine
          doesn't have enough power. Swearing under his breath,
          Frank reverses back down the steps.

          EXT. CLOUD GATE

          Phil and the Black Guy both look back over their
          shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic
          CLOUD GATE. No sign of the Towncar. The Black Guy holds
          up his hand for Phil.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man.
          Wicked.
          They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil,
          the WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up.

                         PHIL
          â¢ Sorry.

                         BLACK DUDE
          s cool.

                         CLARA

                         (SPOTTING SOMETHING)
          They're back.
          They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's
          driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Jesus! What the hell are you guys in
          trouble for?

          EXT. GREAT LAWN

          Phil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss
          of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then SPIN onto
          Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         81

          EXT. COLUMBUS DRIVE

          Phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at
          Clara.

                         PHIL
          Can we just try to work together at this?

                         CLARA

                         PHIL-

                         PHIL
          I'm not blaming you. Please?
          Clara nods.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Now whatever direction I give you, take
          your normal version of it and tone it
          down like 85 percent, OK?

                         CLARA
          35 percent. Fine.

                          PHIL
          OK. Small left. Now!

                          E
          Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts
          They ZOOM around the corner.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

                         (LOOKING BACK)
          Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara!
          Now give me a medium right. Do it!
          She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another
          street.

                         CLAA
          Yes!

                         BLACK DUDE

          They make the slightest turn.

          Yes!
          (spotting something ahead)
          No.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Oh no.

                         CLARA
          What?
          Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER
          comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is slowly
          rising.
          Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in.
          The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.

                         BLACK DUDE
          say we can pop you guys up and over.

                         BLACK DUDE
          You climb over, then we both reverse it
          and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you
          flying over the top.

                         CLARA
          What?
          Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back
          to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the
          drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE
          WINDSHIELD TO THE OTHER, sitting next to Clara.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Phil, don't even think of it.

                         PHIL
          can do it. Clara.

                         CLARA
          No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!

                         BLACK DUDE
          Here we go now... One... two... THREE!

                         CLARA

          NO!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse,
          stepping on Clara's foot to GUN IT.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

          AHHHH!
          The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in opposite
          directions, then DISLODGE. Phil and Clara's car flies
          reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE...
          .and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY OF SPARKS OVER ON THE
          OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil
          and Clara.
          The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his
          Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank
          and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but
          the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda.
          ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank
          and Harry.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Hope you all got insurance.
          Hitting a button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on
          his Honda.

                         U

          INT. PHIL AND CL ARA' S CAR - CONTINUOUS

          As their car comes to a SMOKING, SPINNING STOP in the
          middle of the deserted road, Phil sandwiched in air bags,
          catches his breath.

                         PHIL

                         (INVIGORATED)
          We did it! We did it!
          A DOOR SLAM. Phil moves an air bag aside to see Clara
          MARCHING AWAY down the street.

          EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Phil rushes after Clara, trying to catch up.
          Where are you going?

                         CLARA
          I want to make sure that at least one
          our son's parents survives tonight!

                         PHIL
          What?

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         CLARA
          You almost just got us killed!

                         PHIL
          I see. I almost got us killed. Forget
          about the people chasing and shooting at
          us all night long because of the
          reservation you stole.

                         CLARA
          There's a difference between fleeing from
          people shooting at you and knowingly
          driving a car in reverse over an open
          drawbridge!

                         PHIL
          Unbelievable! You know, all you complain
          about is that I don't take risks anymore.
          Then the second I do, you get mad at me
          for doing it! I can't win with you!

                         CLARA
          Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't
          you!

                         PHIL
          Oh, you have no idea! Every single day
          from the moment we wake up you're bossy,
          â¢ disapproving, inconsiderate-

                         CLARA
          I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!?
          Have you ever seen our bathroom in the
          morning after Tsunami Phil's blown
          through? The floor! The sink! You use
          my toothbrush.

                         PHIL
          What's the difference? Afraid you're
          gonna get my cooties?

                         CLARA
          I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me!
          And how many years have I asked you to do
          a simple thing like put the toilet paper
          in right?

                         PHIL
          Listen to yourself! You have problems
          with how I pqt in the toilet paper!

                         C
          Because under makes no sense, Phil!
          Under makes no sense! When it's under it
          doesn't pull off right! It just keeps
          spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade
          properly!

          85.

                         CLARA (CONTVD)
          After ten years of asking you to have
          roll the right way, you still can't do
          it!

                         PHIL
          Yeah, how about the fact that I have not
          woken up with our comforter over me once
          in those 10 nears! You steal the whole
          thing away from me every night and
          mummify yourself.

                         CLARA
          What? Phil, I do not "steal" the
          comforter. It just happens when we're-

                         PHIL
          (points at her)
          Bulls Bull-shit.

                         CLARA
          Don't you point that at me!

                         PHIL
          I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't
          think I don't!

                         (ILLUSTRATING)
          You wrap that leg around and lock the
          comforter down then reeeeel it in so I
          can't pull it at all.

                         Â¢

                         CLARA
          I do not leg lock the comforter!

                         PHIL
          Oh yes you do!

                         CLARA
          u think I don't know your little
          icks? Where you leave like half a
          thimble of milk in the carton and put it
          back in the fridge so you don't have to
          be the one to "finish" it and replace it?

                         PHIL
          You're right. I do that. You know why
          do that, Clara?

                         CLARA
          Because you don't want to haul your
          ass to the market to buy it yourself!

                         PHIL
          Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I
          the wrong kind of grass-fed bio
          homogenized whatever and meet your wrath!
          You're like the Nutrition Nazi.

          And I've got to be your little Nutrition
          Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this
          "united front" with Ollie! What's wrong
          if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar
          instead of one? Or if his handwriting
          isn't perfect? Or if he goes to school
          for one day not dressed like Finneas J.
          Nerdo!

                         CLARA
          Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I
          must be hard having to be the cool fun
          parent while I get to be the one who
          makes sure our child's fed, clothed and

          SURVIVES!

                         PHIL
          How would you even know? You don't give
          me or anyone else a chance! You're so
          goddamn controlling! You've got to be
          Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line,
          looking down on them from her fancy
          Wonder Woman plane and controlling
          everything with all her wonder
          superpowers! You paint yourself as this
          victim but you get off on being the
          superlady!

                         CLARA
          Urgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay
          attention to you, Phil? Because you give
          me a headache!
          Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a
          frustrated sigh.

                         PHIL
          What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse?
          How could it be?
          Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks
          and the contents spill all over the road.

                         CLARA
          Screw you, Phil!

                         PHIL
          Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I
          survive tonight I'm screwed all around
          anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with
          my job!

                         CLARA
          What are you talking about, screwed with
          your job?

                         PHIL
          was supposed to spend all tonight
          guring out a new brilliant plan for the
          fund so George wouldn't take it over
          tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna
          happen!

                         CLARA
          Why didn't you tell me?

                         PHIL
          I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I
          didn't want you chiming in on how Mr.
          Rivers was right. He wants the new guy
          for all the reasons you complain about
          me! Someone who doesn't "play it safe."
          Someone who'll "take a risk."

                         CLARA
          I can't believe that's what you think
          do.

                         PHI
          Yeah, well...

                         (BEAT)
          You know, when you set up this whole
          "magical" night, in that dress... I got
          this glimmer that it was going to be like
          it used to be with us. But... I don't
          know. I guess we're just not those
          people anymore.

                         CLARA

                         (BEAT)
          I guess we're not.
          Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the
          street. Clara, trying to hold it together, h
          and starts to gather the items from her purse
          something catches his eye. She picks up the
          ENVELOPE that Dora put in her bag.

          EXT. ROADWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          As Phil walks along, Clara comes running up behind him.
          Phil! Phil!
          She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath.

                         PHIL
          I think we said all needs to be said
          right now, Clara.
          Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         CLARA
          This... this... this...

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA

                         (PANTING)
          Side cramp... Wow.
          She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying
          to stop her cramp. Confused, Phil opens it and looks at
          the pictures inside. His brow furrows.

                         PHIL
          What is it?
          Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS
          THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil's eyes go wide.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Oh jeez. It's... it's...

                         C
          It's the Mayor.
          Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in.

          PHIL (V.0.)
          I bet this didn't have anything to do
          with Stockton at first.

          EXT. DESERTED STREETS - LATER

          Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece
          things together.

                         PHIL
          The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's
          club one night. He saw Dora working
          there and obviously gave some sign that
          he was interested.

                         CLARA
          So much for "Mr. Squeaky Clea

                         PHIL
          Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and
          convinces her to take him up on it so
          they could photograph it and blackmail
          him.

                         CLARA
          They knew it was an election year and he
          would have to pay them whatever they
          asked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         PHIL
          But somehow Stockton found out about the
          photos too and wanted that power over the
          mayor himself.

                         CLARA
          So he sent his guys to the restaurant to
          intercept the Gales and get the photos.

                         PHIL
          But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed
          before the Mayor even had a chance to
          show up.
          Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.

                         CLARA
          What?

                         PHIL
          If we could find some way to get in touch
          with the mayor directly, without anyone
          else knowing, there actually might be a
          way out of this for us.
          Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.

                         CLARA
          can.

          DOORMAN BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT
          Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman
          building and start toward the elevator, straight past the

          NIGHT DOORMAN.

                         DOORMAN
          Whoa whoa whoa. Where do you
          you're going?

                         CLARA
          Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605
          The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen

                         DOORMAN
          And you are?
          looks at him in shock.

                         CLARA
          Are you crazy? It's 4 in the morning!
           We were lust out for dinner. Trust me

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         Â¢

                         DOORMAN
          I'm not really allowed to just let you up

          The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well
          dressed suburban couple.

                         DOORMAN
          OK. Yeah. Go ahead.
          The elevator door opens and they get inside.

                         PHIL

          You too.

                         ELEVATOR
          As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each
          other, then simultaneously slip PAPER BAGS with EYE and
          MOUTH HOLES over their heads.

          INT. MRS. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Mrs. Cardigan, in her frilly nightgown with her eyemask
          pulled up on her forehead, walks through her dark living
          room toward the POUNDING on her front door.

          PHIL (O.S.)

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          All right. All-
          As Mrs. Cardigan opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their
          masks, BUM RUSH her. Screaming, Cardigan dodges, running
          back to her desk. Phil and Clara give chase, but
          Cardigan grabs a LARGE METAL YARDSTICK and starts
          WHOPPING PHIL over and over on his paper bag head,
          screaming the whole time.

           MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)

          AHHHHH!

                         PHIL

          OW! OW! OW!
          Clara grabs her from behind, bringing her down.

          INT. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Having put Cardigan's eyenask back over her eyes, Clara,
          bag off, holds Cardigan in a chair as Phil comes back
          into the living room holding two spools of FUZZY YARN.

                         PHIL
          I can't find any rope. Only yarn.

                         CLARA
          Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I'll start
          looking.
          Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying
          Cardigan's arms to the back of the chair, while Clara
          searches Cardigan's desk.

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          You two weren't very prepared.

                         PHIL

          Phil looks over. Clara makes the "Cut it out" gesture
          across her throat.

          If you're done tying her up, come over
          and help.
          Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks
          on the desk.

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          The name's Cardigan, not Rockefeller, if
          you haven't figured it out yet! What

          out of here before you know it.
          Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook, when
          he spots something and doubles back, starting to read.
          His brow furrows.
          Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Got it!
          She notices Phil's expression.

          CLARA (CONT ' D )
          What?
          hands the book to Clara to read. She does and
          darkens.

          As this hits them, Phil and Clara look at each other,
          then at Mrs. Cardigan, blindfolded in the living room.

          The PHONE RINGS in Mayor Reynold's bedroom. He hops up
          and peers at the clock - 4:30 am - then at the caller ID.
          CARDIGAN, L. He looks over at his wife who snores loudly
          with earplugs in, then picks up the phone, confused.

          The Mayor looks over nervously as his wife stirs. She
          goes back to snoring and he whispers into the phone
          again.

          Nazi! I'm just trying the only way I
          know how to keep everything from fall
          apart!

                         PHIL
          It won't fall apart. And I really can
          help whenever you feel like it is. With
          Ollie. Whatever. You just never act
          like you need me to.

                         CLARA
          That's because as it is you see us as a
          distraction from your work!

                         PHIL
          You think I see you guys as a
          distraction? God no, Clara.

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          You don't understand... I have this wife
          who does everything better than anyone
          I've ever known. And the greatest son.
          You want to know why I obsess so much
          about my stupid job? Because I want to
          feel like... like I can do something good
          enough to deserve someone like you. I
          mean, I look at you and I jest don't
          stack up.

                         CLARA
          That's crazy, Phil. You do. You're a
          god man. You're the best man I know.

                         PHIL
          I'll never be the guy who remembers
          always put toilet paper on the right way.

                         CLARA
          I don't think I would really want to be
          with that guy, Phil. I just... want us
          to be on the same team again.
          As Clara sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat. He
          nods.

                         PHIL
          Listen, you know what I said before,
          about not being the people we used to be?

                         CLARA
          Phil, we were angry-

                         PHIL
          No, Clara. It's true. We're not. And I
          know I'm going to drive you crazy again,
          and you're definitely going to drive me
          crazy. But I wouldn't want to do it with
          anybody else.
          He hugs her tight.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          We had a good fight tonight, didn't we?

                         CLARA
          Yeah, we did. You know the worst part
          about not talking about all this
          recently?

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA
          We missed out on a lot of make up sex.

          They get up and start walking down the steps to meet him.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

          Phil and Clara meet the Mayor at the bottom of the steps.
          Clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse, handing
          it to him.

                         PHIL
          This is what you're looking for. I've
          tten down our information inside.

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          And that's it?

                         PHIL
          That's it. We're going home now.
          The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him
          toward the parking lot. Mayor Diggs stays behind,
          nervously tapping the envelope in his hand.
          As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S
          CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr.
          Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and
          grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Oh God. Run, Clara!
          Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the
          ground in front of them. They turn, when ANOTHER SHOT
          rings out.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          The next one won't be a warning shot.
          They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and
          Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with
          the plastic.

          MR. STOCKTON
          (to Harry and Frank
          Let's do it over there.
          y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on
          the grass nearby.

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          I'm going to wait in the c r

          Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

          As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he
          opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and
          Clara to walk to the plastic sheets.

                         PHIL

          Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then
          walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground.

          Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes
          looking back at him and they kneel in front of the
          plastic, side by side.
          Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his
          gun.

          sifts through pages of DOCJ J:TTS that were in t h ''w Wila

                         PHIL

          pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you
          -.sre so casual about is not needing to
          worry about the cop who was after us.
          That made me a little suspicious because
          I never told you which cop it was.

                         CLARA
          Then we got to talking and realized how
          dumb we were.

          Which meant Stockton was probably your
          buddy.

          MR. STOCKTON
          Where are the pictures?

                         PHIL
          But we were still confused, because if
          you guys are buddies, how do you explain
          the Falconwood Corporation?
          Mr. Stockton's face blanches.

          MR. STOCKTON
          They're obviously not going to tell us!
          Just shoot them!

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          Wait. I've heard that name. What's the
          Falconwood Corporation?

                         PHIL
          Runs the hiring of inspectors for the
          Department of Highways in Chicago. You

                         Â¢
          know, the ones who have been finding all
          those violations?

          Manning! I said shoot them!

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          I work for the Mayor, Terrence.

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence?

                         PHIL
          Maybe because according to the paperwork
          you've got there, he owns Falconwood.

                         CLARA
          Not only that, you'll see those other
          pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called
          Eurostruct - which rents the city all of
          its construction equipment.

          MR. STOCKTON
          Frank, Harry!
          Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns
          his gun on them.

          103.

                         PHIL
          The more violations Falconwood finds, the
          longer Eurostruct rents the equipment.
          That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor.
          I'm sure that's not a moral problem for
          you, but he's kind of screwing you in an
          election year, isn't he? Some of us are
          pretty pissed off about the roads.
          Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          You did this to me? I don't get it,
          Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I
          have the Lieutenant here watch your back
          on all of your gambling clubs-

          MR. STOCKTON
          Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble
          at? Where I cover your debts? Those
          clubs?

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          I slipped your company 5 no-bid
          foreclosed buildings for a dollar each
          downtown.

          MR. STOCKTON â¢
          You think that pays for what I do for
          you? The girls I have to pay off? The
          jet charters? And let's not even get
          into your "re-election fund"! Let's not
          even go there!

          Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket
          pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck.

          Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy.
          With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the
          WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the
          wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just
          revealed.

          on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827
          RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to
          a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The
          hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find
          a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series
          is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING...

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT

          We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over
          which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT

          A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek
          conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,
          empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure
          hunched over a laptop.
          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build
          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a
          gentle, intelligent demeanor.
          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his
          glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT

          Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty
          cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures
          of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of
          focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk.

          JONATHAN
          Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet?
          The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.

          OLD MAN
          It is tomorrow.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Right. I forgot.
          The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh
          stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous
          porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him --

          OLD MAN
          Anything else?

          JONATHAN
          Uh - no. No that's it, thanks.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood
          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.
          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first
          floor marked by unlit neon: "FLEURS DE SOLANGE." He ascends
          the steps, his keys out --

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Jonathan!
          The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find
          SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,
          standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket.

          JONATHAN
          Solange, you're up so late?

          SOLANGE
          So early, Jonathan. We open in one hour.

          (GRINS)
          So tell me, you have been out with a lady
          friend, oui?

          JONATHAN

          (SMILES)
          Je suis desole, madame, mais no.

          SOLANGE
          But why else does a young man come home at
          such an hour?

          JONATHAN
          Just working late, that's all.

          SOLANGE
          Every night working late, working late.
          (teasing him)
          Ah, you can't fool me. You are Mister
          Mischief maker - I know this! You come by

          later and pick out something for your lady
          friend, oui?

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Very modest. Furnishings are nice, but sparse. Jonathan hangs
          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster
          and an old tennis trophy. Jonathan lies in bed, flipping
          channels on a small TV. Typical late night stuff:
          infommercials; CNN; a Brazilian soccer match; "Channel J"
          (public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex.
          Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks
          back to, the roaring soccer crowd. He closes his eyes and
          drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer..

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          TWO CORPORATE LAWYERS are talking shop while pouring coffee.

          JONATHAN                                                         (0.S.)
          Excuse me.
          Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely
          give him a glance as they continue their conversation.

          LAWYER 1
          So, the Knicks win last night?

          LAWYER 2
          I'm pretty sure, yeah.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, they lost by 4.
          Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.

          JONATHAN
          It was supposed to be a good game though.

          LAWYER 1
          Oh.
          (back to Lawyer 2)
          Hey, so. did you get a chance to look over
          that memo from Watkins?

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN CORRIDORS - MORNING

          Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries his
          coffee past ASSISTANTS and LAWYERS talking shop. He smiles

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          4.

          CONTINUED:
          politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING .

          Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table,
          rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop,
          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-
          its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes
          us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming
          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance.
          Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before
          him. Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank.

          INT. MEN'S WASHROOM -- DAY

          In a stall, Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the
          stall's marble door -- when a sudden KNOCK-KNOCK on the
          divider to his right startles him. He peers down and over, to
          expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St. Journal spread on
          the floor. Another KNOCK-KNOCK. Confused, Jonathan turns to
          address the divider:

          JONATHAN
          Yes?

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          Take a look at this.
          The voice sounds youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his
          Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          The Japanese are developing a toilet that
          can analyze your urine for glucose levels,
          kidney disease, even cancer. They're
          referring to it as the "super bowl."

          JONATHAN
          That certainly is                                               - something.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Of course if you've ever been to Japan,
          you know they're nuts about their toilets.
          I'm talking web sites, symposiums...
          Jonathan chuckles.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          You think I'm kidding. They have bowls
          over there that cost more than a piano.
          What I want to know is how you're supposed
          to retrieve this analysis - you know, from
          your super bowl.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe they're developing a fly with a
          nursing degree. A superfly.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)

          (LAUGHS)
          Who's in there anyway?

          JONATHAN
          Uh, Jonathan Messer.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          Messer... What department?

          JONATHAN
          None. I'm from Worth and Berman. I've been
          over here a few wee--
          A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound of
          zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          So you're an accountant?
          Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.

          JONATHAN
          Audit manager, yeah.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires
          Worth and Berman to give their blessing to
          our books, and they send you?

          JONATHAN
          Have laptop, will travel. What about you?

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          What about me?

          JONATHAN
          Well, I didn't get your name for one.th--
          The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          .ose.

          JONATHAN

          I said it's Wyatt. Wyatt Bose.
          Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door -
          - only the men's room is now empty.

          COMPUVOICE                                                       (SOUND ADVANCE)
          Message-four. Three-oh-eight-pee-em.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell
          phone. We..find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger.

          PETERSON                                                         (O.S.)
          Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to-
          confirm you're wrapping up over there at
          Rutherford Stern because the controller at
          Clancey has been on me to get someone in
          there by Thursday. I told him how
          brilliant you are, said you're the best
          auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you
          some documentation...
          Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in
          worth&berman.com. He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a
          day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week. Other
          than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain
          on the tabletop. Yawning, he glances at his watch -

                                                                                               MALE VOICE   (O.S.)

          Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the'
          doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice:

          WYATT
          Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home
          and saw the lights. We met before, in the
          can...

          JONATHAN
          Sure. It's Wyatt, right?
          WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something
          very likeably "on" about him.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          7

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          So do you normally work this late?

          JONATHAN
          Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of
          here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to
          finish up. What about you?

          WYATT
          You kidding? This is an early night. Hard
          to believe that once upona time a man's
          success was measured by how little he had
          to work. You know in Sweden the average
          worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation?
          (regards his stacked files)
          Do-you like accounting?

          JONATHAN
          It's all right, if you enjoy working with
          numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?

          WYATT
          It's all right. If you enjoy working with
          assholes.
          Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.

          WYATT
          Well, I'm probably disturbing you -

          JONATHAN
          No - it's okay. Really.

          WYATT
          So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have
          to like be in Mensa to work there?
          Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly.

          WYATT
          Been with them long?

          JONATHAN
          Since my senior year of college. They
          subsidized my graduate degree.

          WYATT
          Really. So you were poor?
          Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          S.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Well - I guess you could say that. I was
          raised by a single mother, and she died
          when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't
          so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people
          have had it worse.

          WYATT
          Not around here. Practically every suit I
          know is Harvard by way of Andover.

          JONATHAN
          Are you?

          WYATT
          Me? Hell no... I'm Princeton. By way of
          Exeter.
          Jonathan laughs. Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces.

          WYATT
          So. Jonathan.

          (GRINS)
          What do you say to a break?

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH. Tilt up from
          Jonathan's laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on
          top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint,
          staring out at the rain hammering the far windows.

          JONATHAN

          (STONED)
          .It's just sometimes I feel so - I don't
          know - removed. I mean, I work for one of
          the biggest accounting firms in the world,
          and.there's not so much as a desk there to
          prove it? They've decided all we need are
          cell phones and laptops. Messages are
          voice-mailed, documents e-mailed, salary's
          deposited online. Chet Peterson, my senior
          manager? I swear he wouldn't recognize me
          if I was sitting in his chair.
          Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts:

          JONATHAN
          I don't know... I used to have friends.
          But it's like I've spent so much time
          trying to prove myself, working these
          hours                                                           - you can only do it so long before

          everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With
          everyone... And I try to meet people at
          work. I do. But it's always the same. To
          the accounting staff I'm a pain because
          for two weeks they have to hold their
          breath and hope I don't pick up on any of
          their screw ups. And to everyone else, I'm
          just a temporary fixture, so why bother?
          The truth is, this is the first meaningful
          conversation I've had in I don't know how
          long. It's like if I disappeared tomorrow,
          I'm not .sure anyone other than Solange
          would even notice - she's my neighbor. I
          live on what must be the only block in
          Brooklyn that still isn't hip.

          (EXHALES)
          I guess I just never counted-on the
          isolation. It's like sometimes I look
          through that glass, and I see life
          literally passing me by.
          Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence.

          WYATT
          Jonathan?

                                                                          JONATHAN
          Yeah?

                                                                          WYATT
                                                                          By the clock on the wall there? You've
          just talked for                                                 37                                       minutes straight.
          Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up. Jonathan hesitates,
          then he too starts to laugh so now they can't stop, their
          laughter filling the expansive room -- until it's drowned by
          the SOUND ADVANCE OF POURING RAIN...

          EXT. MIDTOWN - STREET - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan hurries in the cold. rain for the Times Square
          subway. He's just about to descend - when across                7th Avenue
          he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat,
          clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street.
          Jonathan gazes at her, almost gasping. She's surrounded by
          pedestrians with umbrellas., she's the only one without one
          and she's DRENCHED. But she seems content to entertain
          herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the
          umbrella in front of her.
          Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the
          subway below reminds him he'd better move.

          

          

          

          

          10.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan stands in a long line to buy a Metrocard, his
          glasses steamed up. He takes them off to wipe the lenses.
          JONATHAN'S POV: the entire station is a blur, all unfocused,
          muted colors, no object discernible from another -
          - until his glasses return his POV to immediate focus, and he
          sees the same Young Woman in'the camel.hair coat, a pair of
          dollar bills in her hand, entering the station.
          Jonathan can't help but stare again. Despite her business
          attire, there's an almost childlike lightness. to her step.
          Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can
          make out the first letter of a monogram: "S."
          She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers
          waiting, then decides life's too short. She continues past,
          headed for the turnstiles.
          Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase,
          then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow
          gap in the turnstile.
          A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement.
          Glancing up, she catches his eye, and blushes a mischievous
          smile. Once she's through, she drops her money into his
          collection - and slips out of view.
          ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still stuck on line, staring at the space
          she vacated.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM -- SHORT TIME LATER

          Jonathan arrives as an N train pulls away, the platform now
          practically. empty.
          Weary and still a bit stoned, Jonathan peers sleepily into
          the dark expanse of tunnel, yawns -
          And then he sees "S" is waiting on the same platform. Ten
          yards away. He gazes at her. She's unwrapping some GUM. He
          watches as she puts a piece in her mouth.
          The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN. "S" heads for it, Jonathan
          follows...
          The train halts. The door before him is the last of its car,
          the door before her the first of the next.
          The doors open.

          CONTINUED:

          II S â¢ II
          (turns to Jonathan)
          Excuse me, is this the train for canal
          Street?
          It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice. She's even
          more arresting up close.

          JONATHAN
          Uh,.either one is                                               -- I mean the N and the
          R both stop there so, you know, either
          way, I mean, this is the right train. Yes.
          SOS Of
          Thanks.
          "S" enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her
          car but doesn't have the nerve. He enters a different car.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER

          Jonathan's slumped against a window, annoyed. at himself for
          not getting in her car.
          He can see 'S'. She sits in the other car chewing her gum. He
          studies her, he's absolutely knocked out by her.

          CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.
          He sees "S" rising to join the small crowd gathering by a
          door.
          Jonathan stands up - his last chance. Determined, he braces
          himself and rises, grasping his briefcase.
          The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into "CANAL ST.

          STATION."
          A sudden JOLT of the braking train.causes Jonathan to stumble
          slightly and his briefcase BANGS against a seat and SNAPS
          OPEN - contents tumbling out. His cell phone hits the floor.
          Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches
          to a halt, nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell
          phone a few feet along the grimy floor.
          O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs
          for his phone a second before it's stepped on. He hurriedly
          stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and
          paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet -
          - to find the doors closing, and "S" gone.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          12.

          CONTINUED:
          Devastated, he hurries to a window, searching the platform as
          the train begins to depart... He can just glimpse the back of
          her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel.
          He stands helpless, just shuts his eyes and lowers his head.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing Wyatt
          enter, talking animatedly with Lawyers                          1   and 2. Caught up in
          telling his joke, Wyatt doesn't seem to notice Jonathan.
          Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance
          up. His eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting -
          but Wyatt just nods coolly, returns to his fellow lawyers.
          Jonathan's smile falters. He exits wordlessly.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - DAY

          Jonathan hands over files and CD-Roms to a less than sociable

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER.

          JONATHAN
          I guess that's it. then. Nice meeting you.

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER
          Uh huh.
          Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back.

          JONATHAN
          Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt
          Bose's office?
          The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here.
          She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a
          laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's
          eyes follow her lazy finger down the list --

          A GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, quit looking down her shirt!
          Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to
          find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor.

          WYATT
          Leaving, huh? So where to next?

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols
          after that.
          Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in
          the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder.

          WYATT
          Hey, wait up a sec.
          (smiles back)
          Well, good meeting you, Jonathan.
          ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer.
          Jonathan bends for his briefcase -

          WYATT                                                           (O.S.)
          Wait, so you have off tomorrow?
          Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall.

          WYATT
          You don't happen to have .a. decent
          backhand, do you?

          INT. MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY

          Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play
          mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's).
          Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net
          Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan
          and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his
          brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return.

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt
          returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball
          back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it
          back. Jonathan returns it with equal force.
          A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back
          each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely
          managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his
          racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball.
          Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a
          near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two
          inches outside the opposite baseline.

          WYATT
          Out!

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          14.

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air. Silence - then
          Wyatt's SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space.

          WYATT
          Commiserations, Messer. Good game.
          They shake hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted.

          WYATT

          (WARMLY)
          Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat
          the crap out of me.
          Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's
          already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the
          court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to
          the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter.
          The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net.

          WYATT
          They asked if we'd fancy a post-game
          cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it.
          Jonathan is barely able to speak.

          JONATHAN
          Oh? I would've been happy to.

          WYATT
          Are you kidding? They're a couple of first
          years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do
          better. Hey, you OK?
          Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet.

          INT. RACKET CLUB LOUNGE

          Soft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area.
          Wyatt is admiring Jonathan's weathered tennis racket.

          WYATT
          Man, I remember when these first came out.
          I think I was a frosh at boarding school.
          (chuckles; fingers a string)
          Jeez, are these strings natural gut?

          JONATHAN
          Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut
          and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I
          should replace them, they're all frayed...

          CONTINUED:
          Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes
          suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar.
          From behind, it looks remarkably like "S"...
          Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise.

          INT. LOCKER ROOK!

          Wyatt and Jonathan in towels, heading for the showers.
          Jonathan still deep in the 'S' moment -

          WYATT
          Have you ever considered contacts?
          Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face       -
          his eyeglasses in particular.

          JONATHAN
          Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was
          allergic to something in the solution.

          WYATT
          Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your
          eyes especially.
          Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel.

          WYATT
          It's not a come on, just an observation.
          (considers him a beat)
          You don't get much, do you.

          JONATHAN
          What - you mean sex?

          WYATT
          No, flood insurance. How many women have
          you slept with?

          JONATHAN
          Oh, I don't know, not a whole-

          WYATT
          Of course you know. Everyone knows.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe - four.

          WYATT
          Maybe four?

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Okay fine, just four. What about you?

          WYATT
          Me? I have no idea.

          JONATHAN
          What? You just said everyone -

          WYATT
          I meant everyone like you.
          Confused, Jonathan looks up -- as Wyatt disappears into a
          shower stall.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan emerges freshly showered, a towel around his waist
          as he walks toward the rows of lockers.

          WYATT                                                          (O.S.)
          Tonight?... Fine. I'm on the list?
          Jonathan finds Wyatt half-dressed, seated on a bench by a
          locker and talking on his cell phone.

          WYATT
          There better be.
          Wyatt hangs up, looks up to find Jonathan staring, puzzled.

          WYATT
          Something wrong?
          Jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket, and
          pulls out his own cell phone. It's identical to Wyatt's.

          JONATHAN
          We have the same phone.

          WYATT
          Oh - and you thought I was using yours?
          I can afford my own phone calls, you know.

          JONATHAN
          No, I wasn't                                                   -- of course you can-

          WYATT
          I'm pulling your dick, Jonathan.
          (grins, slams his locker)
          Actually, I was just firming up some plans
          for tonight. Are you free?

          Me? Sure, I guess                                               - but I don't want to

          INTRUDE-

          WYATT
          You're not. What do you say, are you in?

          JONATHAN
          I guess I could go home and change.

          WYATT
          To Brooklyn? Forget it, you can borrow
          something of mine.

          INT. WYATT'S BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

          A three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village
          neighborhood. As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they
          pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN                                   (50s) in a fine suit.

          WYATT
          t                                                               a                       uten Abend, Herr Kleiner.
          (glances back)
          This way, Jonathan.

          INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT

          Urban chic to a serious degree. Big terrace, funky furniture,
          framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive
          young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image
          of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.

          WYATT
          Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner
          downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he
          hooked me up with the gallery in Munich.
          Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,
          pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are
          like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by
          one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair
          bleached blonde and loosely spiked.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Talk about a bad look.
          Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right
          behind him,. a slick, expensive SUIT draped over his arm.

          Here, try this one.
          (off Jonathan's hesitation)
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off.

          WYATT
          You hope you can pull it off. You know who
          you remind me of? James Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Who?

          WYATT
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when
          you loosened him up. Only from day one, he
          just didn't fit in. For starters, he was
          dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there
          was always this boundary - this wall -
          between Getz and everyone else. You could
          argue we laid the foundation, but he built
          it. Built it by believing the lie.

          JONATHAN
          What lie?

          WYATT
          That he was any different. The clothes,
          the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all
          one big masquerade. Anyone can get in,
          you've just got to wear a costume. But
          Getz never got that. He assumed he could
          never scale the wall, when the truth is he
          was the only one guarding it. It never
          occurred to him his anonymity could be an
          asset. No one gets over like the guy who's
          just a face, an impression. We are - all
          of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be.

          JONATHAN
          So what happened to him?

          WYATT
          Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.

          JONATHAN
          (hesitates a beat)
          You're pulling my dick, aren't you.
          Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          With both hands.
          Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit.

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat.
          He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders:

          EMCEE
          And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine,
          the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you
          to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour!

          INT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT

          An ultra-elite "new burlesque" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s
          Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female,
          sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE
          performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease.
          Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted
          with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a
          small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag
          films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience.

          WYATT
          It's a little self-conscious, but I
          thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's
          that suit working out?

          JONATHAN
          Oh - great, actually.

          WYATT
          Keep it then. I've got two just like it.
          Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen.

          JONATHAN
          Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass?

          WYATT
          We'll try not to spill any.
          (regards the floor show)
          So what's the wildest thing you've ever
          done? Sexually, I mean.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          20.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've
          never been too adventuresome.

          WYATT
          All right, what's the lamest thing then?

          JONATHAN
          The lamest...
          Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, that was probably a few months
          ago. I was flipping through money magazine
          and saw this small ad in the back. It read
          something like "Are. you feeling all alone?
          Looking to meet women but have forgotten
          how?" And-there was this number.

          WYATT
          And you called it? So what happened?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing actually. The phone just kept
          ringing. And that's it.
          Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up.

          JONATHAN
          Lame enough for you?

          WYATT
          You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine.
          That is beyond lame.
          Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table
          lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then
          picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE
          at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .All right... Goodbye.
          Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt.

          JONATHAN
          She wants to dance.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          ON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER
          Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old
          Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her shoulder to his table,
          where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone.
          Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud
          smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself.
          The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear...

          BACK TO WYATT AND JONATHAN'S TABLE
          Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan
          returning alone, looking deflated.

          JONATHAN
          She's a hooker.
          Wyatt shrugs, grinning.

          JONATHAN
          Hold on - you knew? What - are all the
          women here prostitutes?

          WYATT
          That depends on what you mean by that
          word. Stretch the definition and you could
          incorporate most of the men as well.
          (sips his drink)
          You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only
          belong to a union, they have to pay taxes.

          JONATHAN
          You seem to possess quite a store of
          international trivia.

          WYATT
          Not really. I just get around... Jonathan,
          relax. It's not like she just shot your
          dog. I was only trying to help. Besides,
          what are you looking for - a relationship?
          As if you have time for one? This was your
          first day off in how long?

          JONATHAN
          Three weeks.

          WYATT
          Four for me. Face it, we've mortgaged our
          youth. Pimped out our twenties. But we
          still have needs. And there's nothing
          shameful about wanting them met.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          22

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          So you sleep with hookers?

          WYATT

          (LAUGHING)
          Me? Never.

          JONATHAN
          So how do you - meet your needs?
          Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting
          in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl.

          WYATT
          What if I told you...
          (breaks off, laughs)
          Christ, I sound like an infommercial.

          JONATHAN
          What were you going to say?

          WYATT
          Listen. You don't think that women have
          these same urges? Young women, just like
          ourselves, successful and working their
          asses off to stay that way? You better
          believe they do.

          JONATHAN
          And?

          WYATT
          And - well - let's just say, there's a
          way...a way it can be taken care of.

          JONATHAN
          You make it sound like a mob hit.
          Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show.

          INT. TAXI CAB - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Jonathan are in the back seat. A quiet beat.

          JONATHAN
          What you were talking about, before.
          Peoples' needs...
          Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin:

          WYATT
          Some other time.
          (to Cabbie)

          (CONTINUED)

          At the corner, please. The Rhiga Royal.
          (to Jonathan)
          Listen, I have to meet someone..

          JONATHAN

          (SURPRISED)
          Oh... okay.
          The cab pulls up before the RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL.

          WYATT
          Hey. You had a good time tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks.

          WYATT
          I'm glad. Listen, that thing with the
          hooker, I'm really sorry if I                                   -

          JONATHAN
          Forget it. It was funny.
          Wyatt smiles warmly, pats Jonathan's shoulder.

          WYATT
          I'll give you a call tomorrow.
          Wyatt                                                           climbs out. Jonathan watches through the cab window as
          Wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby.
          LATER: Driving in the cab, Jonathan catches his reflection in
          the glass. He smiles, liking how he looks in Wyatt's suit.
          Outside, rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur.

          JONATHAN
          (To driver)
          Hey. Could you let me out at the next
          corner over there, on 7th Avenue?

          EXT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY - LATER

          Jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw "S".
          He buys a New York Times and a hot-dog.
          Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted
          to the spot,.hoping he'll see that face in the crowd.
          After a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it
          and heads down into the-subway.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - A CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

          Clancey's stiff CONTROLLER                                      (50s) hovers nervously over
          Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          24.

          CONTINUED:
          Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger,
          pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its.

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          Any problems, you'll want to see Julie
          Levinson, she's our assistant controller                       -
          or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior
          accountant. If Werner's unavailable, we
          have two staff accountants                                     - but like I
          said, I don't anticipate any problems. I
          mean we've never had any before, so...

          JONATHAN
          Right.I just need the access codes for
          the accounts and sub-accounts?
          The Controller suddenly looks uneasy.

          JONATHAN
          You've got account numbers, but no access
          codes. Without those I can't get the banks
          to authorize statement verification.
          (beat; smiles)
          Besides, how else can I steal the money?

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I
          do need those codes though, when you get a
          chance.

          INT. CLANCEY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Other than Jonathan's suit and tie, the reduced number of
          post-its and the lighter stack of files                        - little has changed.
          Jonathan is hunched over his laptop. Like Rutherford Stern's
          conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall.
          Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference
          to him. Slightly different tank, slightly different fish.
          CLOSE ON A BUSINESS CARD: a Rutherford Stern masthead,
          beneath it Wyatt's name and office number. Jonathan picks up
          his cell phone and dials it. RING... RING -

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Hey, Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          How'd you know it was-

          WYATT (O.S.)
          You really ought to block your caller ID.
          So - same place as yesterday?

          EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

          Along the entire square of ledge, throngs of SUITED BUSINESS
          TYPES bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare. It's here
          we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite.

          WYATT
          I wonder what the Founding Fathers would
          make of this scene.
          Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing
          expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to
          work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat.

          JONATHAN
          I'm just glad to be outside.
          (awkwardly heartfelt)
          I've got to tell you, this has been great,
          meeting up for lunch. I used to just-
          A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their
          jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's
          ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge.

          WYATT
          Yes?... Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme
          on the 6:15                                                     out of JFK tonight... Fine.
          Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's.

          WYATT
          Rutherford needs me to join him asap in
          London to paper some financing with
          Lloyds. I tell you about this?

          JONATHAN
          No - no you didn't.

          WYATT
          Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks.
          Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in.

          JONATHAN
          Sounds exciting.

          WYATT
          Nah, it'll be boring as sin.

          Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises
          from the ledge.

          WYATT
          Shit, I'd better get back. You ready?

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

          Sitting before his laptop, Jonathan takes out his cell phone
          and punches in some numbers.

          COMPUVOICE                                                     (O.S.)

          ENTERED-IS-NOT-VALID-PLEASE-TRY-YOUR-
          He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded
          message. He hangs up -- when it abruptly RINGS, surprising
          him. He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it.

          JONATHAN
          Jonathan Mess-
          CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then
          replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger.

          INT. CLANCEY BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          As ignored as ever, Jonathan is squeezed among EMPLOYEES on
          their way home. TWO SECRETARIES speak in hushed tones:

          SECRETARY 1
          .That's just it. You caught him in a
          lie, so now everything he says you have to-
          RING of a cell phone. RING... RING... It's Jonathan's.
          Surprised, he takes out the phone, presses talk.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          A soft, electronic rustle from the other end... then:

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                  (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          I asked if you're free tonight.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION

          Jonathan is heading for the DOWNTOWN N/R when:. RING...
          RING... His cell phone again. He steps aside and answers:

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other end. Then:

          I'm sorry, I didn't get that?

          JONATHAN
          I said I am free, but I                                         -

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Could you be at the Plaza in one hour?

          JONATHAN
          The hotel? I - I guess, but -

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S'.)
          Beneath the Eloise portrait.
          THE ROAR OF A TRAIN pulling in. Only when the train passes
          can he hear the other end. But now there's no one there.
          Jonathan stares at his cell phone - and frowns.
          Close on the phone's display as Jonathan scrolls down its
          list of stored numbers. His expression says none are
          familiar. And NOW he gets it.

          INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

          A heavy-set CABBIE glances in his mirror at Jonathan in back,
          cell phone to his ear.

          JONATHAN
          (into phone)
          Hi, it's Jonathan, I've got your cell! I
          guess you must have mine. I imagine you're
          in the air now, but call when you get
          this. if you do. Oh, and you got a call
          from someone who I'm...forget it, just
          call me.
          Jonathan hangs up.

          CABBIE
          So where ya visiting from?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          CABBIE
          You're from out of town, right?

          JONATHAN

          (PUZZLED)
          Me? No.

          CABBIE
          Huh. I can usually tell. You seem like a
          tourist.

          JONATHAN
          I've lived here all my life!

          CABBIE
          No offence, pal.
          The cabbie pulls over on Central Park South. Jonathan leans
          forward, peers up at the gorgeous French Renaissance facade.

          CABBIE
          Well, here ya are. The Plaza.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Sheer elegance. Wealthy GUESTS stroll, chat, lounge. Hotel
          STAFF in immaculate uniforms greet, assist, etc..
          Jonathan anxiously wanders the perimeter, then slows as he
          spies a PORTRAIT OF A PRECOCIOUS LITTLE GIRL grinning at him.

          SAME SCENE - SHORT TIME LATER
          Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait,
          glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure --

          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an
          attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the
          point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit.

          THE BLONDE
          Are you waiting for me?

          JONATHAN
          I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt,
          right?

          THE BLONDE
          Excuse me?
          (hesitates, appraising him)
          I'm sorry, did we speak earlier?

          JONATHAN
          Yes. Yes we did -

          THE BLONDE
          Good. Let's go then.

          INT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an
          ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair.
          Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the
          lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          (whispers aside)
          Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and
          I., we don't know each other...?
          She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips.

          THE BLONDE
          No fooling.
          DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows.

          THE HALLWAY
          Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The
          Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain
          there's been some kind of mistake.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          30.

          CONTINUED:
          She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him.

          THE BLONDE
          You're not who I spoke with on the phone?

          JONATHAN
          No - I mean, yes, but -

          THE BLONDE
          You're not attracted to me?

          JONATHAN
          Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          -

          THE BLONDE
          It's just what... exactly?
          She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to
          explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a
          moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long.

          INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER

          A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies
          lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's
          tentativeness is all but gone.
          Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under
          waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow
          annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language:

          THE BLONDE
          Fuck.
          LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of
          mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but
          she's fast asleep.

          INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open.
          Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all
          alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the
          FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am.
          He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her.

          INT. PLAZA - RECEPTION DESK - MORNING

          Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK.

          checked out at                                                 6:20                                   this morning.

          JONATHAN
          Well could you tell me the name of the
          guest who was staying there?

          DESK CLERK
          I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose
          information regarding our guests. If you
          give me her name, I can confirm if she was
          registered here.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, the thing is... it's okay.
          Forget it.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - MORNING

          Jonathan exits to good tidings from the BELL STAFF. Lost in
          his thoughts, it takes him a moment to respond.
          He starts to walk. His cell RINGS. He answers.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Hey, you're up early!

          JONATHAN
          Hi! How's London?

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Raining. So you've got mine-and I've.got
          yours?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Listen, last night...um...I met this-

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Damn! Sorry, I'm gonna have to call you
          back, they want me in a meeting. Hey, no
          long distance calls, okay!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a
          cab, glances back at the hotel. His lips curl into a vaguely
          proud, if still dazed, smile.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - DAY

          Jonathan sits alone at the long conference table, working but
          distracted. He pauses, eyes Wyatt's cell phone sitting there.

          INSERT - EXTREME CLOSE ON THE CELL PHONE'S DISPLAY WINDOW
          The numbers stored have no names associated with them. It's
          just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list
          of phone numbers that seems to go on and on.
          Jonathan clicks on a number at random. It highlights itself.
          Jonathan hesitates, then clicks again. The number is dialled.
          RING...RING - a woman with an elegant BRITISH ACCENT answers:

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.0.)
          Yes?

          JONATHAN
          Hello, um - I'm sorry to bother you                             -

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.O.)
          How did you get this number?

          JONATHAN
          Through a friend.

                                                                          BRITISH ACCENT                             (V.0.)

          if you'll excuse me                                             -

          JONATHAN
          wait -
          Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up.

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.O.)
          Yes?
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN. What to say? And then:

          JONATHAN
          (braces himself, swallows)
          Are you free tonight?
          He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up. A long silence.

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I can be.
          Jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief.

          Where?

          JONATHAN
          Where. Right... The Plaza?

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I'm afraid that's a bit uptown for me.
          Perhaps the Mercer? Say by the
          Shakespeare, half past eleven?

          JONATHAN
          The Shakespeare?

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                 (V.0.)
          It should be fairly evident.

          INT. THE MERCER HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          The SoHo industrial motif is the antithesis of the Plaza. By
          a vintage book library we find a sleekly dressed YOUNG BLACK
          WOMAN perusing spines of Salinger, Scott, Sheherazade -

          JONATHAN                                                       (O.S.)
          Excuse me, um - I'm sorry to disturb you -
          She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of
          Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          I'm - supposed to meet someone here and-

          BRITISH ACCENT
          You're rather new to this, aren't you?
          Jonathan falters. She smiles.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          That's okay. I like that.

          LOBBY ELEVATOR
          She enters first, then Jonathan. He waits for her.to push a
          button - only it seems she's waiting for him to do the same.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, what floor?
          She rolls her eyes.

          BACK TO THE HOTEL LOBBY
          Jonathan and British Accent cross the lobby once more.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Frankly I'm surprised that whoever gave
          you access didn't explain more.

          (SIGHS)
          Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no
          jobs                                                           - no nothing. Two, latex is mandatory
                                                                         and non-negotiable.. Three, no rough stuff   -
          the only rule that's even remotely
          malleable provided there's mutual consent,
          although I say if that's your thing, take
          it elsewhere. And finally...
          She halts a few feet from the registration desk.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          The initiator is responsible for the room.

          JONATHAN
          (takes him a second)
          Oh - so I should...?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Precisely.

          BACK IN THE ELEVATOR
          Jonathan is holding a key card. British Accent is leaning
          against the opposite wall, eyeing him with a slight grin. A
          moment. DING. The elevator doors open.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          They are headed for a room as he ventures another question:

          JONATHAN
          So are there a lot of - people - who do
          this?
          She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when
          the CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE
          WAITER is crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan
          turns back to find her staring at him uneasily.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          How did you get into this?

          JONATHAN
          Well, a friend of mine -

          BRITISH ACCENT
          He uploaded your numbers but failed to
          explain the basics?

          (off her frown)
          I'm doing something wrong, aren't I?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          It's not that, it's just... well, you
          strike me as something of a stowaway. In
          fact if I were more suspicious, I'd say
          you didn't belong here at all.
          Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation ---

          BRITISH ACCENT
          But obviously somebody felt you did.
          The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt!

          BRITISH ACCENT
          And I'm a sucker for bashful boys...
          She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm... and
          removes the key card from his hand.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and British Accent having sex. She has his arms
          pinned back, writhing on top of him, clearly enjoying the
          control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - BEDROOM- LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan lies in bed-beside British Accent.

          JONATHAN
          Can I ask you something? Why do you do
          this?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Why are any of us doing this? For the
          economics of the arrangement.
          (rolls over, away from him)
          It's intimacy without intricacy.
          Jonathan's about to reply --

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Look, I've got a 7                                            a.m. breakfast, so...
          She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat.

          bare few. He dials a number on 'his' cell:

          Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess
          you're busy.with stuff over there.
          (smiles to himself)
          I've been kinda busy too! I've been
          wondering - did you mean for me to take
          your phone?

          Jonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance
          - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot
          where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can
          see you grinning right now.
          Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps
          inside --

          JONATHAN                                                        (V.0.)
          Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you.

          INT. THE BENJAMIN - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Jonathan seems somewhat more relaxed as he lingers in the
          lobby. A woman with a BOYISH HAIRCUT taps his shoulder.

          INT. THE REGENCY - A ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and an ASIAN WOMAN having sex on a plush celadon
          carpet, two briefcases resting side by side a few feet away.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENT SERVICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone as usual, Jonathan now seems strangely contented in
          this isolated state. WORKERS pass in the wall of glass, but
          now he doesn't bother looking up.
          In his briefcase, we note the inclusion of a toiletries bag.

          At a registration desk, Jonathan hands his credit card to a
          DESK CLERK. A BELLHOP gestures to a luggage cart. Jonathan
          shakes his head, looking confidently past him to a TALL WOMAN
          seated inconspicuously among the various out-of-towners.

          INT. THE DRAKE - ROOM - MORNING

          Jonathan wakes up alone, his necktie knotted around a
          bedpost. He reaches for the phone, presses "Room Service."

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - COPY ROOM - DAY

          Jonathan is waiting to make some copies when the SECRETARY at
          the copier hands him a stack of paper...

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Can you hold these?

          INT. THE MARK - ROOM -- LATE NIGHT

          .only the voice belongs to the woman Jonathan is having sex
          with - referring to her legs that she wraps around him.

          INT. THE FITZPATRICK - SUNDRY SHOP                              - MORNING

          Jonathan buys a bottle of O.J. and a 36-count box of condoms.

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - CORRIDOR DAY

          Carrying his coffee mug, Jonathan suddenly slows, his eyes
          locked on The Blonde with whom he'd first been at the Plaza.
          Her eyes fix on his as he.nears                                 - a flash of mutual
          recognition... then nothing as they pass without a word.
          Jonathan can't help but allow himself the slightest grin.

          INT. HOTEL ELYSEE - THE "CLUB ROOM"                             - NIGHT

          Jonathan wades confidently through a sea of YOUNG EXECUTIVES.
          He approaches a REDHEADED BUSINESSWOMAN. He asks her
          something. She looks up, confused ---
          -- when ANOTHER REDHEAD taps his shoulder. Her free hand
          slips into his,. their fingers interlocking...

          INT. THE PARAMOUNT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          . PULL BACK from interlocked fingers to find Jonathan's
          hand entwined with ANOTHER WOMAN'S. We realize we're watching
          their image in a MIRROR when we PAN away from the mirror...

          to Jonathan and YET ANOTHER WOMAN having sex. The bed
          keeps banging against the night stand - a glass of water,
          moving closer to the edge with every bang. There's something
          almost rote about it, a numbness in the repetition... the
          glass FALLS, HITS the ground and BREAKS.
          MATCH CUT TO: Jonathan PLUNGES into water.

          INT. THE PENINSULA - HEALTH CLUB - MORNING

          Jonathan doing laps. He emerges from the pool, strides with
          confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side:
          OLDER COUPLES snoozing, PARENTS adjusting floaties on kids,
          BUSINESS TRAVELLERS with airport novels.
          He continues toward us, hair slicked back, like Wyatt's.

          MONTAGE ENDS/ CUT TO :

          EXT. BROOKLYN - JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at his building's steps to find Solange
          hurrying out of her flower shop. She embraces him warmly.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, for so long I don't see you!

          JONATHAN
          J'ai ete tres occupe. with work.
          He's exhausted. And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly
          activities.

          SOLANGE
          Work? No, no. You believe you can trick
          me, Mr. Mischief Maker! I want to meet
          this lady friend of yours.
          Jonathan is about to protest -

          SOLANGE
          Ah., ah                                                        - ecoutez, I have beautiful winter-
          roses, just. arrived. She.will swoon...
          Jonathan smiles, but there's a reticence to it.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe later, okay?

          SOLANGE
          There is no later when it comes to love!
          If you find it, you must not let it go.

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan nods absently, continues up the steps                  - when she
          tugs his sleeve. He turns to her; she searches his eyes.

          SOLANGE
          There really is no one?
          Jonathan evasively shakes his head.

          SOLANGE
          There should be, Jonathan. It is not good
          for a young man to be too much alone.
          He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as
          she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him.
          Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and
          disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his
          FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his
          cell phone. A beat, then another...
          .and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out
          into the night.

          INT. THE HUDSON HOTEL - LOBBY -- LATE NIGHT

          Checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits, Jonathan
          faintly hears what sounds like WYATT'S LAUGH. He quickly
          turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby. Through slotted
          glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men.
          Reflected in the mirror, a WOMAN appears behind him. Jonathan
          freezes, his eyes grow wide -

          WOMAN
          Excuse me...
                                                                          He doesn't breathe. Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm...
          It's her.                                                       -It's "S".

          INT. THE HUDSON - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but she's
          oblivious, smiling casually back at him.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          "S" enters first, flips on the light, proceeds inside.
          Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued.
          "S" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair. Jonathan
          remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the
          wrists of her blouse, then the collar button.

          Jonathan is about to say something but can't. She undoes the
          next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the next --

          JONATHAN
          Before we...um, the thing is                                   - I know you.
          She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front
          clasp of her bra.

          JONATHAN
          Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met
          before. In the Times Square subway
          station. It was raining...

          â S â

          (GRINS)
          In the subway?

          JONATHAN
          You had no umbrella. You were soaked.

          âC,.
          It's true, I don't have an umbrella.

          JONATHAN
          Then you asked me if the N train stops at
          Canal.
          She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles
          warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse.

          JONATHAN
          Wait.

          âSÂ»
          Is something the matter?

          JONATHAN
          This just seems strange, that's all.

          SÂ
          Because you've seen me before?

          JONATHAN
          Maybe. I don't know, it's just                                 -

          (EXHALES)
          Ever since that night on the train, I've
          thought about how nice it would be to see
          you again. And now suddenly, here you are,
          taking off your clothes.

          âSâ
          Well, maybe some other time.
          Jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat -

          JONATHAN
          Wait - don't go.
          She glances back curiously.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean is, by any chance... are you
          hungry?

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN

          A BELLMAN rolls a cart noiselessly down the carpet, placing
          early editions of the New York Times before each room.
          He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper. We can hear
          the sound of JONATHAN AND "S" TALKING AND LAUGHING...

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          They sit across from each other Indian-style on the bed. The
          radio is tuned to a pop music station. They're finishing a
          meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously.
          You have some ketchup on your chin.

          JONATHAN
          sorry, I'm a messy eater.
          âsâ
          Me too.
          Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes
          the napkin, dabs it in water and cleans him up.

          Don't!
          She puts her finger to his lips. A first touch. An
          electricity between them.

          âC/,
          (a playful smile)
          You know the rules. No names.

          JONATHAN
          The 'rules' seem to specify no
          conversation either.
          as.,
          They are a little rigid, aren't they? But
          I think we should obey the 'no names'.
          It'll be fun!

          JONATHAN
          Ah, but I know.yours begins with an 'S'.

          JONATHAN
          Trust me, it's not a pretty sight.

          "S:,
          I'll be the judge of that.
          He hesitates, then takes her hand, rises to his feet, and
          starts to dance with her. He's self-conscious at first, but
          she's agile enough to guide him, and soon he's into it.

          See? You just need the right partner.
          She closes her eyes, swaying with the music. They dance
          together. He's falling even harder for her.
          As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn
          escapes her. She covers her mouth.

          She drops down on the bed, tugging him down with her. They
          lie back, side by side.

          JONATHAN
          I'd like to see you again. Not in a hotel.

          Hmm. I'd have to think about that.

          It is tomorrow.
          She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes
          her eyes and drifts off. Jonathan gazes over at her. The
          perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The
          tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe.
          And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares
          at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away.
          He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from
          under her -- when she stirs and nuzzles closer. He looks over

          arm... and chooses this perfect moment over knowing any more.

          INT. THE HUDSON - HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes slowly open.
          JONATHAN'S POV: her purse is no longer on the chair.
          He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her
          pillow. The indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself.
          He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom. There's a NOTE
          on the desk on hotel note paper:
          Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will
          call u later. Sunbeam xxx
          He stares at the note, beaming - when his cell phone rings.
          Jonathan picks it up.

          A bea- - and then Wyatt's familiar laughter.

          JONATHAN
          Hey! Are you back in town?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          I wish. It's friggin' anarchy in the U.K..
          I'm stuck here at least another week.

          JONATHAN
          Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night
          - at the Hudson.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been
          enjoying my little gift.

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I
          met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          That's fantastic! Who is the lucky gal?

          JONATHAN
          She's a member of your naughty little sex
          club. I have broken all the rules and had
          an honest-to-God conversation.

          JONATHAN
          I'd like to say it's a long story but it's
          not. When you are coming back, you gotta
          meet her.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          So she's, what, a lawyer or something?

          JONATHAN
          I-have no idea, I don't know all that much
          about her. All I know is I can't wait to
          see her again.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Listen, I don't want to dampen your
          spirits, but - be careful, okay?

          JONATHAN
          What do you mean by that?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Nothing. I'm just saying, this club                         - who
          knows who anybody is, right?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just
          have to go with what you feel, don't you?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          True enough. Hold on a sec.
          Muffled sounds of Wyatt talking to someone else.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          It's non stop back-to-back bullshit here.
          Listen, I'll call you later. And hey -
          congratulations!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan smiles. And then reads the note
          again - grinning.

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

          The morning crush of executives filing toward elevators.
          Among them we spot Jonathan, just slightly out of step, a
          sleepy smile lingering on his face.

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE DAY

          Jonathan is working on his laptop, clearly distracted. He
          looks at his cell phone, hoping it will ring, but it doesn't.
          He calls up the list of "Recent Calls: Incoming," scrolls up
          to the top number. It reads: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks worried, wondering how he can get a hold of
          her - when his cell phone rings. He immediately picks up.

          JONATHAN

          I think you have the wrong number.

          EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at the subway station. He's a little anxious
          now, still hasn't heard from her. He lingers at the top of
          the stairs, not wanting to descend. Below him he can hear the
          lonely roar of a train pulling in below.
          only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his
          cell phone is ringing. He picks up.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          Intermittent static on the other end. And then what sounds
          like a WOMAN GASPING; it's unclear if it's a sound of
          pleasure or pain.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan debates hanging up - when
          the gasps halt,--replaced by the faintest whisp__of_ a female
          voice: "No... No please..." There's no mistaking the tone now
          it's fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM...
          - and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the
          phone in his hand, like he's just witnessed something awful.
          He quickly checks the display: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was "S"-
          - when the phone rings again. He hesitates, then picks up.

          Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice.

          EXT. CHINATOWN - CANAL STREET - NIGHT

          Jonathan stands on a corner, looking out of place amidst the
          glistening neon and bustle of Asian faces. He peers anxiously
          down the.street, checks his watch, all anticipation             -
          - when something is wrapped around his eyes. He's startled,
          tugs it off and spins to find "S" smiling back at him.
          if S I'll
          I bought you a present.
          She drapes the scarf around his neck. It's all striped,
          bright colors                                                   - all the more funky against his dark suit.

          not sure if it was real, or if it was even

          sounded like she was being - I don't know,
          hurt. Maybe worse.
          "S" seems instantly on edge. Something about this scares her.

          You don't know who she was?

          A makeshift street market, everything from fish and meat to
          cheap electronics for sale in cramped stands. Jonathan and
          "S" walk arm in arm through the packed crowd, like a couple.
          Jonathan looks like we've never seen him before: a
          fascination with everything around him, especially her.
          They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets, including a
          small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle.

          INT. A RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN - LATE NIGHT

          An intimate place, Jonathan and "S" are the only patrons at
          this late hour. They sit across from each other, grinning at
          "Duck On Bike" as it totters across the table, trips over a
          chopstick and flails on its side.

          it.
          A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in

          thirty this year, and I made this vow to
          live only in the present. And it's good,
          you know? And yes, maybe it's because
          there are things in my past I don't care
          to think about - but that's the same for

          Jonathan and "S" step out into pouring rain, pause under the
          shabby awning. Waiters inside are putting chairs on tables.
          She fishes in her coat and pulls out a PACK OF GUM. The
          wrapper is entirely in Chinese. She offers him a piece.

          JONATHAN
          Oh - no thanks.

          Don't let the wrapper intimidate you. I

          though it sort of tastes like hairspray.
          She chews her gum. He watches her; the jaw line, her lips.
          She looks at him and smiles, but there's something behind it:
          a sadness. Almost an uneasiness.

          itself at once tender and passionate.
          She absently lowers her hand, lost in the unexpected
          intensity of the kiss. Embraced, they accidentally step under

          (breathless whisper)
          Maybe you should go...

          JONATHAN
          Maybe you should stay.
          She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately. Again
          they feel the awning's drops, and Jonathan moves to shelter
          them -
          - only "S" leans into him instead, leading him out from under
          the awning, the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces
          as they continue to kiss, the moment purely exhilarating.
          wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her, soaked
          and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's
          just breathed for the very first time.
          Rack focus on a hotel down the street, its neon sign reads:
          "Hotel Lotus."

          INT. HOTEL LOTUS                                                - ROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan and "S" lying on the bed in their white hotel bath
          robes                                                           (underwear on), his arm around her as they watch TV. He
          strokes her hair. She nuzzles up to him.
          She changes channels. Finds some tennis.

          JONATHAN
          Perfect.
          They watch together.
          âs_..
          So were you any good?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. But I didn't want it enough. The
          guys who make it really need it. I played
          recently, first time in years. I've got
          this friend - a new friend, he's great.

          Maybe you'll meet him one day. Anyway, we
          played and he creamed me. But I knew I was
          better than him. He said I had no killer
          instinct.
          I's. it
          .I don't know, I think you're a pretty
          determined character.

          JONATHAN
          On a level with this feller?
          He points to 'Duck on bike' watching over them like a charm.

          "S
          Given the chance I believe you could be.
          She idly flips channels, finds a romantic melodrama, an old
          black and white film. They settle back to watch.

          JONATHAN
          I know we said we wouldn't rush. But for
          the record, I'm doing everything Ican to
          apply.the brakes here.
          âS                                                             . of

          (PAUSE)
          And for the record, I'd like nothing more
          than to make love right now. But I'm kind
          of glad we decided to wait.

          JONATHAN
          It's a wise and mature choice we've made.

          //S . ,/
          Our parents would be proud.
          Pause. Jonathan is wild with lust for her.

          JONATHAN
          But say we did, just say...
          Mmhmm...?

          JONATHAN
          Say we were to suddenly tear off these
          robes... Would that be such a terrible
          thing? For two people in Manhattan -

          âS.
          In the small hours on a wet Winter's
          night...

          Its. I.
          You were saying?

          JONATHAN
          Who - who would blame these two people?

          Who could possibly judge them?
          They face each other, breathing deeply, almost panting...

          JONATHAN
          And who would know?
          His face is inches from hers                                  - when she rolls over and
          reaches for a glass of water on the night stand.
          She sips her water, as she turns back to Jonathan. Still,
          Jonathan picks up on her subtle shift.

          JONATHAN
          is everything okay?
          She starts to say something, then stops herself and nods
          instead. She sets down her glass, starts to get out of bed.

          JONATHAN
          Where are you going?

          I,S,I
          I saw a machine down the hall. I'll be
          right back.
          She starts to tie her robe closed -

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          That's all right, I'll go.
          He hops off the bed, grabs an ice bucket from the mini bar
          and a key card from the table, he surreptitiously adjusts his
          penis                                                           (as one does): and goes to the door. He's about to turn
          the handle when -

          ., Sâ
          Wait -

          JONATHAN
          (glancing back)
          Yes?
          She hesitates a cryptic beat - then shakes her head, and
          smiles at him with immense tenderness. Jonathan beams back.
          its . P1
          Hurry, okay?
          He blows her a kiss, she blows one back. Almost in SLOW
          MOTION. She looks stunning.

          INT. HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

          As Jonathan exits the room, hold on the room number:            517.
          Jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine. He's
          giddy with excitement. Passionately alive.
          At the ice machine: an eccentric OLD WOMAN in her night
          attire is slowly filling a bucket. Piece by piece.
          Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to
          break her long nails.
          Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration.
          She turns, looks him up and down - he feels a bit self-
          conscious in his robe and bare feet.

          JONATHAN
          Would you like some help, ma'am?

          OLD WOMAN
          I can manage, thank you.
          Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way.
          .Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          59.

          CONTINUED:
          Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key
          card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers.
          We see Room 518                                                 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on.
          Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his
          robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in
          the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light
          blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on
          the door, calls out:

          JONATHAN
          I can't get the card to work.
          He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears
          something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel:
          red.
          He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?... Hello?
          He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting
          anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card
          again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into
          the door. Nothing.
          Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns
          green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks
          the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into

          THE ROOM
          He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we
          glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets.
          Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath
          quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket.
          Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed,
          splattered all over the crumpled sheets...
          Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just
          as he senses something behind him and BANG!                     - something hits
          him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of
          potatoes.

          BLACKOUT.

          TWO HOURS LATER
          THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The ice has melted, a pool of
          water seeps out... follow the flow to arrive at Jonathan's

          fingers... slowly responding to the cold water... The TV
          playing a different film now.
          OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on the floor. He groans a little.
          Rubs the back of his head. Checks his hand for blood.
          Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet,
          shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of "S."
          He runs into the bathroom. Also empty.
          Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING
          DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED.
          He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every
          trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets
          are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them.
          He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in
          the morning, no one around.

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

          Tripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the
          corridor. He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow
          corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator.
          Jonathan tears off in its direction...
          He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are
          located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor
          indicator overhead: "4" slowly creeps to "3".

          INT. STAIRWELL

          His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each
          floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip
          their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing
          to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and
          continues to dash down...
          BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he
          lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in

          THE LOBBY
          His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around
          his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild-
          eyed and shaking. It's utterly vacant at this hour, the only
          sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' "Yesterday."

          The Asian Clerk working there snaps his head up with a

          Two hotel SECURITY GUARDS take the lead as they near room
          517, Jonathan trailing, breathless and shaken...

          JONATHAN
          .I saw blood on the bed and then someone
          hit me. When I came to, she was gone.

          SECURITY 1
          This woman you were with. What's her name?
          Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing.

          SECURITY 2
          Sir?

          JONATHAN
          I don't know.
          (off their looks)
          It starts with an 'S'. I think.

          SECURITY 2
          Was shea prostitute?

          JONATHAN
          No! No, she's just a person. A friend.

          SECURITY 2
          A friend with no name.

          JONATHAN
          Of course she has a name! I just don't -
          we have to find her - something must have
          happened to her!

          INT. ROOM 517

          The two Security Guards are eyeing the bed.

          SECURITY 1
          I thought you said there was blood?

          JONATHAN
          I told you, whoever did this must have
          cleaned it up while I was out.

          My wallet and keys                                          - they're gone! They
          were right here...
          He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies.    His
          SCARF is gone too.

          SECURITY 2
          Maybe she took them.

          JONATHAN
          What?!

          SECURITY 2
          It happens.

          JONATHAN
          She didn't do this, okay?! Something
          happened to her! You don't understand, we
          were... Wait!
          He sees something on the floor between the bed and night
          stand. He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          This                                                        -- this was hers...
          Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her
          existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE.

          Sir - are these your clothes?
          Jonathan nods absently.

          SECURITY 1
          How about putting them on.

          INT. LOBBY - LATER

          Jonathan arrives to find DETECTIVE RUSSO                    (female, mid-30s)
          waiting by reception with a UNIFORMED OFFICER. Seeing
          Jonathan, she sizes him up a moment, then approaches him.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I'm Detective Russo.

          INT. POLICE PRECINCT - RUSSO'S DESK - LATER

          Still shaken, Jonathan sits in a wooden chair across from
          Russo, amidst the din and traffic of the precinct.

          (SCEPTICAL)
          And you don't know anything about her.
          Where she works? Where she lives?

          JONATHAN
          I told you how we met.

          RUSSO
          Through a sex group.
          Her flat words hang in the air. He guiltily avoids her eyes.

          RUSSO
          Does this group have a name?

          JONATHAN
          I don't                                                         -- it's not like that.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I spoke to the desk clerk. She
          only recalled seeing you check in.

          JONATHAN
          That's... that's the way it works.

          RUSSO
          All right. But now you're telling me that
          in addition to this mystery woman, there
          was another individual in the room?

          JONATHAN
          Not at first -- look, I know how it
          sounds, but I'm telling you, whoever hit
          me must have - I don't know -- taken her.
          Maybe even...
          He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, have you had - experiences
          like this before? Taking any sort of
          medication?

          JONATHAN
          I'm not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished
          back there! There was blood all over the
          goddamn bed!
          He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A
          CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the
          genuine desperation in Jonathan's face. She finally picks up.

          Yeah.
          (glances at Jonathan)
          No, I don't think it's necessary... Right.
          She hangs up and turns to Jonathan. He looks away, barely
          able to contain his devastation.

          JONATHAN
          What am I supposed to do?
          An awkward silence, then:

          RUSSO
          If you want to file a report regarding the
          items she -
          (corrects herself)
          - the items you claim were stolen...
          Jonathan shakes his head, crushed and exasperated.

          JONATHAN
                                                                          I'd like to go now. Is that all right? Can
          I just                                                          - can I go?

          EXT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan climbs up to the landing, fishes in the dark for a
          boot. He tips it, a SPARE KEY falls out. As he starts back
          down, he feels something in his coat pocket. He reaches in,
          finds "Duck On Bike" where he'd pocketed it.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan stands motionless beneath the shower, face buried in
          his elbow, completely overwhelmed by his loss and longing.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Jonathan enters, wanders for his bed -- when he pauses,
          staring at his dresser. He approaches, peering down at
          something that's caught his eye...
          HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a
          small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy
          base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the
          exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved.
          Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark -
          (SOUND ADVANCE) BANG! of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in

          

          

          

          

          65.

          A SPARE BEDROOM
          Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing
          cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts through
          faded file folders crammed with papers and documents.

          JONATHAN                                                          (INTO PHONE)
          .Your ad says                                                     24-Hour Locksmith... Well
          how soon could you-... Fine.
          He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs
          it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked
          "CREDIT CARDS." Sorting through old statements, he finds the
          line: "To report a card lost or stolen..."

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S HAGGARD FACE in the mirror of a medicine
          cabinet as he pulls it open. Be fishes around, finds what
          he's looking for: a SMALL BLACK CANNISTER for film. He pops
          the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money.
          Jonathan exits the bathroom, crosses the living room to the
          foyer, where we find a LOCKSMITH finishing changing the lock.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Jonathan lies awake, staring at his muted TV, his face tear-
          stained, his eyes clouded.

          JONATHAN (V.O.)
          This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able
          to come in today. I'm - pretty ill...
          'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

          Jonathan seated, resting against the window, drifting off
          into.restless sleep. We MOVE IN TIGHTER ON HIS FACE, tighter --

          CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.

          :
          Jonathan jerks awake. A few stares from nearby passengers.

          EXT. CANAL STREET - DAY

          Jonathan emerges from underground to hectic Chinatown. What
          once felt romantic now feels cold and exclusionary, a
          bustling mix of ASIANS and map-clutching TOURISTS. He surveys
          the area,-overwhelmed, eyes searching for anything resembling
          a clue. Foreign faces return only cold, blank stares.

          Jonathan pauses by a STREET VENDOR, takes from his pocket the
          GUM WRAPPER he found in the hotel, shows it to the vendor...

          INT. CHINESE MARKET - DAY

          Cramped and dingy. Jonathan makes his way to the counter,
          where an OLD WOMAN sits smoking. He holds up the wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          I was told you sell this gum here?
          The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a
          candy display. In one box is the same gum.

          JONATHAN
          A woman - a white woman - buys this brand
          of gum. I need to find-
          The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, I don't                                              -- Do you know the
          woman I'm talking about? A white woman...?
          Please, it's very important that I                              --

          GIRL'S VOICE                                                    (O.S.)
          My grandmother doesn't speak English.
          Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL.(13) in a smock.

          JONATHAN
          Can you ask if she knows the name of the
          white woman who buys this gum?
          The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes.
          a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl
          nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan.

          GIRL
          She says they sell that gum in practically
          every store in Chinatown.

          EXT/INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jonathan is struggling with his stiff new key, hearing his
          PHONE RINGING inside.

          Jonathan rushes for the phone, picks up.

          Creepy and drab. Jonathan enters, approaches a RECEPTIONIST.
          The Receptionist nods, points across the lobby to Detective
          Russo. Jonathan looks very worried.

          INT. M.E.'S OFFICE                                              - A RICKETY ELEVATOR

          The elevator descends with an unnerving rattle as Jonathan
          rides down with Russo.

          RUSSO
          The body came in late last night, although
          time of death's still unclear. She was
          found in a taxi: driver was in a .coffee
          shop on his break, came back to his cab
          and there she was in the back seat.
          The elevator shudders to a metallic stop.

          RUSSO
          Her purse was recovered from a dumpster
          about a block away, so we've got a name.
          Jonathan tenses as the elevator doors BANG OPEN.

          RUSSO
          Simone Forester.
          Jonathan looks sick with fear.

          INT. MORGUE

          Russo leads Jonathan into the harsh fluorescent lights of the
          morgue. A MEDICAL EXAMINER                                      (50s) looks up from a deli
          sandwich, takes one last bite and waves them over.
          As they approach, Jonathan notices the TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS
          stationed down here. They recognize Russo, nod in recognition
          - and eye Jonathan with hard, careful stares.

          SAME -"'MOMENTS LATER
          The M.E. stands over agurney, casually lifts the sheet
          that's been draped over the body. We glimpse a slender foot.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN beside Russo. He turns instantly pale, lip
          quivering as he stares in disbelief, our CAMERA SLOWLY COMING
          OVER HIS SHOULDER to get a look at

          THE VICTIM'S FACE: it's not "S". But we do recognize her.
          It's the Blonde: the first woman he'd been with, the one he'd
          passed without a word in an office some days later.
          She looks the same, only death-pale and naked - and her neck
          marred by a thin, discolored line where she's been strangled.

          RUSSO
          Mr Messer...?
          He tries to speak, but can hardly breathe, let alone answer.

          RUSSO
          Was this the woman you were with last
          night?
          She frowns, suspicious of Jonathan's hesitation. His tense
          eyes whip across the morgue: the two cops still idling there.
          They're out of earshot, but their mere presence amps tension.
          Angle on the guns in their holsters. The handcuffs dangling --

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer?

          JONATHAN
          No - she's not. Not last night... no.
          Russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat.

          Jonathan exits behind Russo as they step onto the sidewalk.

          RUSSO
          I figured it was a long shot. The only
          reason I called you down is she was last
          seen with a man in the bar of the Hudson
          hotel.

          JONATHAN
          (suddenly tenses)
          The Hudson?

          RUSSO
          You mentioned this group of yours meets up
          at various hotels. I thought it was worth
          a shot.
          Russo glances up at him, trying to read him - something about
          his reaction not sitting right with her.

          May I help you?
          Jonathan is standing across from her.

          JONATHAN
          Yes, I need to get in contact with one of
          your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it's
          extremely important. He's working out of
          the London office right now. If I could
          speak to his assistant or someone who'd
          know how-to reach him immediately...

          Of course. Just a minute.

          A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here.
          He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern
          masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion.

          I don't know what's going on, but I can
          assure you, there is nobody here named-

          hands grasp his arms, we glimpse a pair of black wingtips      -
          - and whip tilt up to the papery face of "Herr Kleiner"        (aka

          Jonathan sits slumped against a window, the world around him
          is ceasing to make sense. Across the aisle, a YOUNG BOHEMIAN
          COUPLE sit side by side, her headon his shoulder. On
          Jonathan's face there's a sense of loss that is almost
          overwhelming.
          Jonathan takes the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper from his
          pocket, smoothes it in his hands, stares down at it with a
          look of longing...
          . when his eyes suddenly widen. He sees something inside,
          something he hadn't noticed. He unfolds it to reveal two
          words written in a feminine hand on the white underside:
          I'm sorry
          Jonathan quickly looks up, as if expecting someone else to
          share in this haunting discovery. of course, no one does.
          He stares back. down at it, bewildered, stunned - chilled.

          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CANAL ST., CHINATOWN - LATER

          Jonathan runs out from the subway station. Determined, he
          walks down Canal street, his eyes suddenly land on a COPY
          SHOP across.
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we see something click in his head -

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - LOBBY - LATE DAY

          Jonathan steps off the elevator, heads straight for the
          Receptionist. She immediately looks nervous.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Sir, we asked around, nobody knows the guy

          YOU'RE-

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          When I was working over here, you made a
          photocopy of my I.D..'

          RECEPTIONIST
          We do all freelancers, it's policy.

          (REALIZES)
          Oh - I'm not sure I'm allowed to-

          JONATHAN
          You have to.
          She looks at him', sees his desperation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies, then
          halts on one. He stares at it. The Receptionist peers over.

          RECEPTIONIST
          That's him? He was real cute. Only he
          wasn't a lawyer. He was a systems analyst,
          I think. He was here for a few days to
          work on the computers.
          RECEPTIONIST'S POV: of the photocopy in Jonathan's hand. It's
          of a Massachusetts Driver's License. Staring back up at us is
          Wyatt's smiling face.

          RECEPTIONIST
          I thought you said his name was Wyatt?
          PAN TO THE NAME beside the photo: Sansky. WilliamR.
          Jonathan is already running for the EXIT.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT -- HIS BEDROOM - EVENING

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as an internet search
          engine runs the name: "Bansky, William." A page of some 200+
          matches is returned. Jonathan readies himself, then dives in.
          Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of
          William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license. We see
          Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away.

          ON JONATHAN - MOMENTS LATER
          Checking URLs site by site. He finally pauses on one. It's an
          article from the Boston Herald. The headline: "POLICE HAVE
          FEW CLUES TO YOUNG EXECUTIVE'S DISAPPEARANCE." As Jonathan
          scans the article, we glimpse some lines of text:

          Tilt up to Jonathan, scribbling on a Post-it pad:

          WYATT BOSE = WILLIAM BANSKY, SOFTWARE CONSULTANT, BOSTON

          ORIG. FROM CHICAGO -- $$ TROUBLE
          He sticks the post-it to the photocopy of Bansky's ID. He
          steps back, stares at it a beat - when he notices something
          on his desk,,resting under the phone: a manila file folder.
                                                                          He frowns at it - clearly out of place here. He picks the
          file up, opens it... to a series of                             8X10                                                        photographs?
          Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it's of Jonathan
          standing in the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait. Confused,
          he quickly flips to the next one: in it, a Blonde now stands
          there with him -- the Blonde found murdered. Simone Forester.
          Jonathan's rapidly breathing as he shuffles through more
          photos. They're in sequence, taken by telephoto lens.
          Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator. Opening
          the room door. Undressing. Screwing. In one, Jonathan has his
          hands on her neck...
          He's sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings,
          startling him. He eyes it warily, then slowly picks up.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?

          RUSSO                                                           (O.S.)
          Mr. Messer, it's Detective Russo returning
          your call.
          Jonathan freezes, tries not to sound panicked, his eyes fixed
          on the damning photos of himself and Simone Forester.

          JONATHAN
          Oh - right, I was just - checking in, to
          see if you had any leads...

          RUSSO
          On that missing girl of yours? No, not
          yet.

          JONATHAN
          (anxious to hang up)
          Oh - okay, thanks-

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          Are you sure you didn't know Simone
          Forester?
          The PHOTOS of Simone in his hands, Jonathan tenses...

          JONATHAN
          I told you before -

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          I remember what you said.
          (an unsettling silence)
          And you weren't at the Hudson two nights
          ago?

          JONATHAN
          I don't                                                    -- why are you-

                                                                     RUSSO             (O.S.)
          Turns out among credit card charges made
          that night, there was one with your name.
          The card was declined.

          JONATHAN
          I cancelled them all, the day they got
          stolen.

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          I see. I figured it didn't mean much -
          cards move quickly. It just struck me, you
          know.. The coincidence.
          Jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause.

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          By the way, the morgue confirmed
          strangulation as cause of death. He found
          trace fibres of Kevlar in her neck wound.

          JONATHAN
          Kevlar?

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          It's used in certain kinds of rope and
          string.
          Jonathan's eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze   to
          the hall closet door.

          Thought I lost you for a second.

          (PAUSE)
          Well, I won't keep you. You have a good
          night.
          Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the
          hall closet as he paces toward it, throws open the door.
          In the far corner rests his racket bag. He grabs it, yanks
          open the zipper... his face draining of all remaining color
          as he peers into his empty racket ba                           . His racket is gone.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective
          Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches
          for the phone, and dials... another number.

          JONATHAN
          I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt
          Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I
          know you're trying to frame me for it, so -
          so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And
          where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to
          God I'll...
          Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and
          realizing he's now talking to himself.

          Jonathan hesitates, hits the Star key. A new BEEP. Harder:

          JONATHAN
          It's me. I need to talk to you.
          He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something.
          Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the
          room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy.
          QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his apartment, his
          trophy raised as a makeshift weapon.

          He finally halts, uneasy but satisfied there's no one else
          here - when his home phone rings, startling him. RING...
          RING... RING... Jonathan hesitates. His machine picks up:

          JONATHAN'S ANSWERING MACHINE
          This is Jonathan. Please leave a message.
          BEEEEP. A moment of hiss                                       - then:

          MALE VOICE (O.S.
          Jonathan?
          Jonathan whips to the phone - it sounds like Wyatt ---

          PETERSON                                                       (O.S.)
          Chet Peterson calling -

          I understand you were out today. I left
          messages on your cell but never heard
          back, so I thought I'd try you at home.
          He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the
          window at the dark night and empty street below.

          PETERSON                                                       (O.S.)
          Just want to make sure you're up to speed
          with Weiss Murphy, because the folks at
          Clute Nichols are expecting you...

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

          Jonathan sits in a crowded car, dressed for work.

          PETERSON                                                       (V.0.)
          They're our biggest client, so needless to
          say, make them your top priority...
          Jonathan takes out the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper. He
          stares at it with a look of longing: this is his Priority-

          EXT. CHINATOWN -- DAY

          A series of shots: Jonathan asking around about "S." The
          street vendors. The receptionist at the hotel. The waiter at
          the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads.
          Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a
          discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a
          headline: "STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC." The
          photo is of Simone Forester.

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS BROKERAGE - CORRIDORS                        - LATE DAY

          Intensely preoccupied, Jonathan walks alone past assistants
          and execs. In his eyes a sense of paranoia, a mistrust of
          every strange face.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Isolated behind yet another wall of glass, Jonathan just
          stares bleary-eyed at his laptop, unable to work.

          EXT. CLUTE NICHOLS BUILDING - NIGHT

          Jonathan exits, starts toward the sidewalk -- but hears
          something: sandpaper SHUFFLE of shoes on pavement. Be spins     --
          No one there. Just one of many large stone pillars adorning
          the building. Jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar,
          wavering. He steps closer, trying to glimpse behind it -
          RING! of his cell-phone breaks the stillness. RING... RING...
          He catches his breath, quickly picks up. A silent beat.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE                                                 (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?... Hello?
          He hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer
          - no sound. He hesitates... then turns and walks off.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

          People heading home from work. Jonathan among them, utterly
          desolate. Sliding his MetroCard, he suddenly feels watched
          again. He spins, peers anxiously behind him. Only strange
          faces passing through turnstiles.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION - CORRIDOR

          A narrow, curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti.
          Jonathan keeps a quick pace, feeling vulnerable.
          We lag back, following him from an ANONYMOUS POV; glance up
          at a sign for stairs to the N & R trains.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

          Jonathan is waiting for his train, eyes nervously glancing
          around, still feeling watched -
          When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the
          opposite platform, waiting for a train. She casually turns
          her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide...

          CONTINUED:
          It's "S."
          Jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks;
          he can't believe he's seeing her again...
          . when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run.
          Confused, Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform.

          JONATHAN
          wait! Wait, right there!
          Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her.
          He looks around, hears the distant: .nimble of afar. off train,
          and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him
          capable of: he jumps onto the tracks!
          He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly
          scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails,
          eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third
          rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he
          races for

          THE CENTER DIVIDER
          He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up.
          He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane
          of track separating him from the platform she was standing on
          - only she's no longer there?
          He scans the people waiting, no sign of "S" among them - and
          then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing
          on the center divider, feet soaked in muck.
          Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other
          across the solitary track. Then:

          JONATHAN
          I thought you were dead!
          She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And
          all at once he's hit with a crushing realization:

          JONATHAN
          You are in on this, aren't you?!
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion -
          then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again.

          steal his wallet.
          Jonathan looks confused; she's struggling to stay composed
          but looks like she could break down at any moment.

          âSâ
          He asked if I wanted to make some real
          money. All I had to do was get involved
          with you, and not ask any questions.
          Jonathan just stares, devastated.

          JONATHAN
          So everything between us - was nothing?
          She fights back tears.

          No - no... After that first night I tried
          to call it off, he said he'd kill me if I
          didn't go through with it.

          JONATHAN
          Go through with what?

          âC,.
          The plan. Get you out of the hotel room,
          slip out and meet up later for my money.
          Only I ran instead. He's been looking for
          me ever since. I have to leave the city -

          JONATHAN
          Then why didn't you?

          SÂ
          Because I needed to see you again. I
          needed to be sure you were all right.
          Despite his conflicting emotions, Jonathan is moved          by   this.

          Did you go to the police?

          JONATHAN
          I can't. He's framing me for murder.
          What?

          JONATHAN
          He killed a woman from the club, someone
          I'd been with.
          "S" is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no idea.
          I/ S$f
          Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you
          understand? You need to get the hell out
          of here, he's going to kill you!
          The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER...
          Don't you understand? He's going to kill -
          - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out... and
          swipes "S" out of Jonathan's view.
          Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its
          passengers prevent him from getting a look at her. Just then
          the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on
          and off. Panicked, Jonathan cranes his neck, trying to see
          her through the windows.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          He boards the train; using it as a bridge, he pushes through
          passengers, desperate for an open door to the other side.

          -- only she's nowhere in sight. Jonathan spins frantically as
          the doors close and he hears the TRAIN START TO PULL AWAY.
          He runs alongside the train - desperately searching for a
          glimpse of her                                                  - no sign of her in any of the windows...

          He takes out his cell phone, dials. The other end immediately

          freezes. RING... RING... RING... RING... RING -- a CLICK of
          someone picking up, then SILENCE and faint wisps of static.

          "Wyatt Bose = William Bansky" and other random scribblings.
          He's trying to apply his mathematical mind to his crisis,
          hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all.

          like your typical overly meticulous, isolated auditor.

          I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm
          no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing -
          you know, this thing -- for a while.

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Wyatt is talking, entertaining his two companions - but
          clearly more focused on Black Business Suit, flirting it up.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          I was simply curious. More so when he
          apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten
          about another engagement.
          Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's
          thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance...

          BACK TO MICHELANGELO ROOM

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was intrigued. He was intelligent,
          informed about everything from law to art
          to politics. I'd never met anyone so in
          command of his own charm. He said that
          he'd come from nothing, that everything he
          learned, he learned from his tricks. He
          claimed that Holloway was even grooming
          him for a position at his company.
          She lights another cigarette with her old one.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          In a way, I felt for him. But I also
          admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a
          way of making me feel - close to him, you
          know?
          This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          So I found myself telling him things..
          Personal things. And, next thing I knew -

          JONATHAN
          You told him. About this.
          A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know
          all the details.

          (EXHALES)
          I suppose I'd had too much to drink. And I
          was distracted... I was thinking about
          what a great lay he was going to be.

          INT. FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -.SUITE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal
          aggression. She's on all fours, arching lustily, pleasure
          nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes.
          Exhausted, her body goes limp.
          TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of
          real pleasure. She struggles, tries to protest - when his
          hands grip her shoulder blades, thrusting harder, violently
          pinning her down, her sudden fear stifled by the mattress --

          INT. THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON Black Business Suit staring off, chilled by memory.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          Only afterwards I discovered two of my
          credit cards were missing. As was my cell
          phone. Of course I couldn't say anything
          to Holloway. And Jamie must have known I'd
          never report it to the police.

          (BEAT)
          So I just put the incident out of my mind.
          I all but forgot about it, until one
          night, maybe two months ago -

          INT. THE WARWICK (NYC)                                         - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Black Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of
          Hearst and A SUITED MAN lingering beneath it... when the man
          looks up. It's Wyatt.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                            (V.0.)
          I almost didn't recognize him. But when I
          did, I suddenly felt very, very scared.
          She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks
          his watch, scans-the lobby with a cool, piercing look.

          BACK TO BLACK BUSINESS SUIT AND JONATHAN IN THE MICHELANGELO

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I left before he saw me.
          She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He must have used my cell phone to get
          into the group.
          (crushes out her cigarette)
          Anyway, that's it. That's all I know.
          She looks around. At the room, the bed. She shudders, rises.

          JONATHAN
          Wait - thank you.
          (off her look)
          Have you ever run into him again?

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          Getz? No. And I don't ever want to.

          JONATHAN
          Getz?

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          That was his name. Jamie Getz.

          

          

          

          

          92.

          EXT. FLEUR DE SOLANGE - NIGHT

          Bundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for
          the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices
          Jonathan coming down the front steps.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, you're home early -
          Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the
          overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt.

          SOLANGE
          Oh - je suis desole. My mistake.
          Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps.
          Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face.

          INT. MICHELANGELO - HOTEL BUSINESS CENTER - NIGHT

          Huddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from
          exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall:

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          who's James Getz?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.
          on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton
          University alumni. He types in: Getz, James.
          A beat - then: "No match." A long list of G names follows.
          Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Shit.
          Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the
          H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed.
          Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name.
          "Sort no contact information available."
          Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types:
          "Holloway Reed" then decides to add the word "missing."
          An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: "BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED." A head-shot style
          photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize
          from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his
          name: "Reed Holloway."

          Jonathan glances up at the Hotel employee manning the desk.

          JONATHAN
          Can I print this out?

          EXT. EIGHTH AVENUE                                              (HELL'S KITCHEN)   - LATE NIGHT

          Porn shops and prostitutes, the streets pulsing with a
          sinister energy. Jonathan is pacing toward the subway,
          reading over the printed article.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - ELEVATED SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted
          neighborhood. O.S. the departure of the subway train is
          joined by the distant.wail of SIRENS.
          Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses. He wrinkles
          his nose, smelling something. He looks up: two blocks away, a
          thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky --

          EXT. JONATHAN'S DUPLEX

          Jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and
          fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of
          his building!
          Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked
          across the street, engine running. It suddenly shifts into
          gear and peels out in a fast turn. Jonathan spins               - something
          about it troubling him - but the BMW is already gone. He
          continues racing toward his building...
          The neon "FLEURS DE SOLANGE" sign crackles and sparks in the
          flame. Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers
          emit what must be an awful stench.
          Two EMS WORKERS are loading a gurney on which Solange lays,
          burned and half-aware, but alive, when Jonathan rushes over.
          She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible:

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan...
          He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance.

          JONATHAN'
          (to EMS worker)
          Is she going to be okay?

          EMS WORKER
          Yeah, she'll make it.

          CONTINUED:
          The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand grabs Jonathan's arm.
          He spins                                                        - it's a FIRE WORKER.

          JONATHAN
          I live here.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over
          his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker.
          His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its
          hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down,
          furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls.

          FIRE WORKER
          Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat.
          Better get your valuables together.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          still in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - "Duck
          on Bike" too.

          JONATHAN
          (calls out)
          How did it start?

          FIRE WORKER (O.S.)
          We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM

          Jonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film
          cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left. Not
          very much. He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket.

          INT. SPARE BEDROOM

          Jonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then
          pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take.
          He finds a file marked "Bank Statements," pulls it, about to
          toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its
          contents ---
          CLOSE ON THE FILE. Stuffed with paper. But not bank
          statements... Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan
          with Simone Forester. Some we've seen, some new.
          Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea
          telling us the contents of each and every file have been
          swapped out with photos.

          CONTINUED:
          He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of
          Jonathan and "S" walking in Chinatown. He scans through
          others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel
          Lotus...
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication -

          FIRE WORKER                                                     (O.S.)
          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the
          doorway. He quickly shuts the file.

          JONATHAN
          Just                                                            - give me a minute.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

          A paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed
          near to bursting. The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently.

          FIRE WORKER
          That everything?
          Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little
          evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation.

          JONATHAN
          I guess it is.

          FIRE WORKER
          You got someone you can stay with?

          INT. A SEEDY HOTEL LOBBY - DOWNTOWN - PRE-DAWN

          The sort of decrepit no-tell motel frequented by hookers and
          junkies. Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through
          steel mesh at. the NIGHT CLERK.

          NIGHT CLERK
          It's fifty for the night.
          Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what
          he discovers are his last three                                 $20s.

          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN

          Even more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows,
          stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of
          paid sex bleed in. Somewhere a bottle smashes.

          CONTINUED:
          Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents
          onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and
          "S." She's smiling up at him.
          EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in
          time, at once haunting and heartbreaking.
          He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune
          article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway
          ("BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED"). His eyes
          drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him -
          FLASH ON: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN "WYATT'S.BROWNSTONE" of Wyatt
          with bleached hair styled in a loose spike --
          IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical
          look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17."

          CUT TO:
          Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand.

          OFFICE ON PHONE
          Boston Police, how can I direct your call?
          Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him:

          Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally -

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Well?

          JONATHAN
          You've got a case, a missing person named
          William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can
          tell me the date he was last seen?

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Hold a sec.

          (PAUSE)
          Bansky, William, last seen... May                              17.
          Jonathan's eyes return to the Holloway article                 ("BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED:), dated "May 17."

          That's it, thanks.
          Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by
          the connection he's made.
          TILT DOWN to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: "BOSE =
          BANSKY = HOLLOWAY." To this he adds: "= JAMES GETZ"

          INT. CHASE MANHATTAN BANK - MORNING

          A line of customers stare mutely up at plasma tv screens
          above - except for Jonathan, unshaven, suit wrinkled, face
          all anxious tension.

          SAME - TELLER'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan slides his passport through the window's metal tray,
          to the TELLER                                                   (40s) working behind three inches of glass. The
          Teller examines the passport, then slides it back.

          TELLER
          M'kay, if you'll just swipe your ATM card.
          She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan's right.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, my card was stolen.

          TELLER
          Mmm'kay... do you see those two taupe
          colored telephones over there? Just pick
          up either one and you'll be connected with
          our automated system.

          JONATHAN
          The thing is, I already used your
          automated system and...look, this
          passport's all I have left, it's the only
          thing proves who I am and now I'm down to
          like my last ten dollars here, so...
          Jonathan's cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow.

          TELLER
          Mm'kay, if you press "0" on either phone?
          A customer service representative will -

          JONATHAN
          Give me a goddamn break.

          Sir, there's no need for profanity.

          JONATHAN
          (loses it)
          Oh no? In the last few days I've seen a
          woman I thought might be dead turn up
          alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn
          up dead, both at the hands of a guy about
          whom everything I know is apparently a
          lie. I've had my building set on fire, my
          neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment
          ransacked. So please forgive my language,
          but it's been one fuck of a week.
          The stunned Teller stares back at him slack-jawed.

          JONATHAN
          Look, I know I'm just another face on this
          side of the glass, I get that. But I'm
          begging you, as one human being to
          another, please let me into your life just
          long enough to help me out here. Please.
          The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods.
          She starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up.

          TELLER
          I'm showing that card as having been sent
          out four days ago. It definitely went out.
          We even heeded the change of address
          request.

          JONATHAN
          Well, like I                                                    -- wait, what request?

          TELLER
          Apparently you informed the bank of an
          address change?
          She swivels her monitor so he can see.

                                                                                              finally halts on one: "140             E.   91st."

          We recognize the DOORMAN in the midst of fielding a complaint
          by an ELDERLY TENANT with a yappy dog. Jonathan hurries to
          the elevators, unnoticed.

          INT.                                                            140   E.            91ST -- HALLWAY

          Jonathan emerges from an elevator. The last door on the left.
          Jonathan tries the doorknob. It's locked. Jonathan checks
          under the mat. Sure enough, there's a key.

          INT. THE APARTMENT

          Utterly bare. Empty walls, expensive views, polished wood
          floors. Jonathan takes a wary step inside, leaning to peer
          around the corners.
          He paces cautiously through the living room. The dining area.
          The glistening chrome and granite kitchen.

          THE BEDROOM
          A room as empty as the others - with the exception of a small
          pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner. Jonathan
          slowly nears...to find it's a stack of mail. He picks up an
          envelope -- O.S. the CREAK of a door hinge.
          Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him. He steps out of
          the room to investigate.
          We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat...
          .until Jonathan finally steps back in, only slightly at
          ease. He returns to the stack of mail, picks up an envelope.
          He reads: "Mr. Jonathan Messer 140 E.                           91    St..."
          Eyes wide, he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail -
          all addressed to him at this address.
          Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when he
          finds at the bottom of the stack: another PHOTOGRAPH. It's of
          "S" standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the
          track from Jonathan. And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with
          fear, unaware of a blurred, nearing intruder...

          WYATT
          Long time no see.

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan spins round, Wyatt's standing there with a gun. It's
          pointing directly at Jonathan.

          WYATT
          I have some instructions. Follow them and
          I might let her live.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          This should've been simpler. I frame you,
          you panic...

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?!
          A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts:

          JONATHAN
          Goddamn it tell me what you did to--

          WYATT
          Press pause on the questions and listen.
          The brokerage firm you're auditing is
          Clute Nichols. As a standard part of that
          audit you're temporarily privy to all
          client accounts as well as access codes
          required for transactions. At                                   11                              p.m.
          tonight you're going to skim from those
          accounts a total of                                             $200 million and
          transfer that money to an account I've
          established overseas.

          JONATHAN
          I can't                                                         - I have no idea how to even-

          WYATT
          I know you don't. But I do. Your passport.
          (brandishes the gun)
          Now, please.
          Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches it.
          And hands Jonathan an ENVELOPE.

          WYATT
          It's all in there.                                              11                              pm tonight. Their

          JONATHAN
          It won't work - they screen for stuff like
          this. It'll be discovered eventually.

          WYATT
          I can live with eventually. I always have.

          JONATHAN
          This account overseas                                   - it's in my name,
          isn't it?
          A moment of tense silence.
          Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then:

          JONATHAN
          Why'd you pick me?
          Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question.

          WYATT
          You answered the ad, Jonathan.
          (off Jonathan's confusion)
          "Feeling all alone out there? Have a great
          job, fine personality and good looks to
          match, but no time to.meet that special
          someone? Help is just a phone call away -"

          JONATHAN
          The ad - in Money magazine...

          WYATT

          (GRINS)
          Told you to block that Caller ID. Of
          course I had to scope out a whole lot of
          losers before I hit the jackpot. After
          all, there only so many Jonathan Messers
          out there.

          (BEAT)
          If you screw with me, well - you saw what
          I did to that Blonde? That's kindness
          compared to what I'll do to your little
          .girlfriend. You won't even recognize her
          when I'm through.

          JONATHAN
          Why should I believe you? Everything you
          told me was lies.

          WYATT
          Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now...
          now you're fucked.
          He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          102.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          Remember: be smart. I'll be watching you.
          And... feel free to take a shower, looks
          like you could do with one.
          The front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring
          shell-shocked at the envelope.

          EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

          Jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his
          suit pocket.
          As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to
          find a car barrelling at us. Jonathan dives out of the way an
          instant before the car would have hit him.
          Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers
          up to see Wyatt's BLACK BMW speeding away.

          CUT TO:

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - AN OFFICE - LATE DAY

          A stiff guy in his late-30s is working in his office when an
          ASSISTANT enters.

          ASSISTANT
          Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers is
          here to see you. Jonathan Messer?

          PETERSON

          (PUZZLED)
          Really? Well - okay, bring him back.
          We follow the assistant out the door, read the name
          stencilled on the glass "CHET PETERSON, SENIOR MANAGER."

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - LOBBY

          Through a set of frosted glass doors we see Peterson's
          Assistant approach a RECEPTIONIST, who gestures across the
          lobby. The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is
          seated. She addresses him. He rises.

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - PETERSON'S OFFICE

          Chet Peterson looks up as his door is opened -

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          YOUNG MAN
          Actually, I was just looking for Fred
          Whipple's office?

          PETERSON

          (AWKWARDLY)
          Next door down.
          The Young Man ducks out, and now Peterson sees his Assistant
          approaching, Jonathan a few paces behind her, adjusting his
          glasses. Peterson reloads his greeting:

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          INT. PETERSON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Close on Chet Peterson, gravely peering across his desk.

          PETERSON
          Well, I have to say, your resignation
          comes as something of a surprise. Most of
          our auditors seem to like the freedom the
          position affords.

          (CONCERNED)
          You'll stay on to finish up at Clute
          Nichols, of course?
          Track around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from him,
          lifting his head to reply - and doing so revealing it's

          "
          Wyatt," wearing one of Jonathan's suits, hair colored and
          styled like Jonathan's, even sporting identical eyeglasses.
          He offers an awkward half-smile, just as Jonathan would.

          WYATT
          Absolutely.

          PETERSON
          So do you have any plans?

          WYATT
          Yes. I'm going to travel. I want to see
          the world.
          Peterson nods benignly.

          A SERIES OF QUICK DISSOLVES/ STOP-MOTION PHOTOGRAPHY:
          Jonathan sitting in the conference room of Clute Nichols,
          lettered-boxed by the glass wall through which he watches
          employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers. Throughout this,
          Jonathan's blank stare of harrowed tension never changes.

          Abeautiful shot of the cityscape - accompanied by the sound

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jonathan seated at the far end of the empty table, typing on
          his laptop. Beside him is the envelope Wyatt gave him, and
          its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed.
          Jonathan peers at the laptop clock. It reads                            10:58   PM.
          His eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions, to
          laptop screen, to glass wall - fingers typing all the while.
          He finally reaches a prompt: BIENVENUE. POUR ANGLAIS, CBOISEZ P2.
          We glimpse a small. logo with a SWISS FLAG.
          Jonathan presses F2. Reads some more, types some more.
          Finally we read: ENTER SUB-ACCOUNT NUMBER.
          Jonathan enters more per Wyatt's typed instructions. Reads.

          ENTER DESIGNATED ACCOUNT NUMBER:
          Jonathan copies the numbers in from the instructions. Waits.

          ENTER SENDER'S 8 DIGIT ACCESS CODE. REQUIRED TO COMPLETE TRANSACTION.
          His eyes travel to a page atop a Clute Nichols file. We can
          glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil. Jonathan stares at
          the cursor.on the laptop screen, the icon blinking
          petulantly. He's about to type...
          And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE,
          resting in its charger.
          TIGHTER ON JONATHAN. His eyes fixed on the cell phone, an
          idea forming in his mind --
          RING!! of the cell phone suddenly jars us. RING... Jonathan
          hesitates, then picks up.

          Jonathan says nothing. We can hear Wyatt getting tenser:

          WYATT (O.S.)
          I said what's taking you?

          JONATHAN
          I wondered if you were monitoring this.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Don't worry about what I'm doing. Just
          finish the transaction. Now.

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her.
          (off Wyatt's silence)
          The transfer's impossible without an
          access code. And there's no way I'm
          entering it until I'm sure that she's
          safe. So you tell me. How do we do that?
          Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent. We tighten on
          Jonathan, holding his breath, any plan he's concocting
          clearly hinging on this...

          WYATT (0..S.)
          (low, frustrated)
          You have a wireless connection?
          Jonathan lets out a brief exhalation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut, packs it in his gym bag,
          in which we glimpse the photo he's kept with him of "S"
          smiling up at him.
          He then turns to his cell phone once more. He picks it up,
          scrolls the menu, punches a number.

          An elaborate and intensely packed WEDDING PARTY is being held
          up here beneath the glow of heat lamps, the music and crowd
          noise unspeakably loud. We travel through the din, past
          hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy.

          EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

          The party noise is even slightly audible                        30   stories below,
          where we find Jonathan carrying his bag as he enters...

          INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Jonathan surveys the busy lobby. GUESTS mulling. STAFF
          bustling. And, of course, the "ELOISE" PORTRAIT.

          WYATT (O.S.)'
          May I ask you a personal question?
          Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic
          smile. With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers.
          Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and
          tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          In one of the rooms. Safe.
          (a thin smile)
          I got us a table.

          A WAITRESS delivers a pair of drinks to where Jonathan and
          Wyatt are seated.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy.
          The Waitress leaves. Wyatt raises his glass.

          WYATT
          To friendship.
          Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt.

          He was dead when I met him. Just like you.
          The rest was a mere formality.
          (re: the laptop)
          Of course he didn't have your bargaining
          chip. Speaking of which...

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her. She's the only reason
          I'm here and not at the police.

          WYATT
          I told you, she's in a room. Alive.

          JONATHAN
          Give me the key then.
          Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card
          and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on
          the key card to indicate a room number.

          WYATT
          As soon as you're done, I'll tell you the
          room number.

          JONATHAN
          Not good enough.
          Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a
          handgun concealed by his suit.

          JONATHAN
          You won't let her live. You killed all the
          others, you'll have to kill us too.

          WYATT
          Hey, I like you, okay? You'll be fine.

          JONATHAN
          (scoffs, repulsed)
          You like me.

          WYATT
          I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all,
          you're my creation. I'm the one who gave
          you life.

          JONATHAN
          Don't you get it? It was her, not you!
          She's the one. She gave me life! You can
          steal my identity, but not what's here.

          CONTINUED:
          He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is startled by
          Jonathan's passionate outburst.

          WYATT
          Yeah, well, I'm weeping big wet ones for
          you both. Now, let's get on with it.

          (BEAT)
          I don't have all night, Jonathan.
          Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent. Wyatt lets go of the
          key card. Jonathan opens his bag...

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep.
          The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an
          access code.
          Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then
          pauses, looking confused.
          Jonathan quickly reaches around. to the back of his laptop,
          feels an empty jack - and suddenly turns pale.

          WYATT
          What is it?

          JONATHAN
          My wireless modem - I must have left it in
          the conference room. I can't get back
          online.
          Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething.

          WYATT
          You stupid fuck.

          JONATHAN
          I can go back there and-

          WYATT
          No.
          (thinks, then abruptly)
          Get up.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

          Wyatt and Jonathan crossing the lobby; they arrive at
          HOTEL GUEST BUSINESS CENTER, partitioned by a wall of glass.
          Jonathan and Wyatt stand on the other side, peering in.

          Wyatt takes out a hundred dollar bill, gives it to Jonathan.

          They will now.
          Jonathan takes the hundred, and heads into

          INT. HOTEL.BUSINESS CENTER

          Empty at this hour, with the exception of a sleepy-looking
          EMPLOYEE. As Jonathan steps toward the desk, he takes out
          the hotel key card, his eyes travelling up to a clock
          overhead:                                                       11:29.

          Wyatt eyes Jonathan on the other side of the glass.
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: Jonathan explaining himself to the clerk.
          Satisfied, Wyatt finds a comfortable chair with a direct view
          of the business center's glass.
          Across the lobby, an attractive AUBURN-HAIRED WOMAN in
          business attire glances over at him.

          INT. BUSINESS CENTER

          Jonathan is subtly slipping the                                 $100                            bill to the Employee.

          EMPLOYEE
          You forgot your. own room number?

          JONATHAN
          I just checked in and it's been a hectic
          day. Look at me!
          The Employee looks uneasy - something about the ill-concealed
          tension in Jonathan's eyes.

          EMPLOYEE
          You could just ask at the front desk. I'm
          sure they can-

          JONATHAN
          I really don't have time, okay?
          Jonathan presses the bill into the Employee's palm, peers up
          at the clock again: the big hand clicks over to 11:30.

          Still eyeing Jonathan. He sees the Employee hesitate, then
          accept the money.
          Wyatt looks relieved -- when his view is abruptly blocked by
          the Auburn-Haired Woman.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Are you waiting for me?

          BACK TO JONATHAN IN BUSINESS CENTER
          The Employee finishes swiping his card through a scanner.

          BACK TO WYATT IN THE LOBBY
          His view of Jonathan still obscured by Auburn Hair.

          WYATT
          What the hell are you --
          And then he sees Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise
          portrait, then at her cell phone's clock -- and now realizes:

          WYATT
          Motherfucker!
          He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair aside - eyes darting to the
          Business Center to find Jonathan no longer behind the glass,
          just his laptop resting on the counter where he'd been
          standing.

          INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR

          Jonathan rushes into an elevator car just as it's about to
          close. He turns to find a YOUNG FAMILY riding up with him.
          They've pressed floor 6. He presses floor                       9.

          

          

          

          

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY

          Wyatt arrives at the elevators - none are ready to open. He
          furiously presses the call button, his hand hovering by his
          concealed gun.

          INT.                                                            6TH FLOOR HALLWAY - ELEVATORS

          Ding as the elevator doors open and the family step out.
          Jonathan is left alone, impatiently waiting for the doors to
          close -
          - when his eyes land on something in the hallway: the fire
          alarm. He suddenly reaches out to stop the elevator door just
          as it's about to close.

          INT.                                                            6TH FLOOR HALLWAY

          alarm blares to life. Pan                                                                                                                                     180   to find Jonathan dipping into
          an emergency exit stairwell.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Wyatt is just about to step onto an elevator, when a crowd of
          wedding guests also start to pile in. Furious, he abandons
          the elevators for the nearest stairs.

          INT.                                                            7TH FLOOR HALLWAY

          GUESTS spilling out of rooms met by the blaring alarm...

          Only the party 30 stories above remains oblivious: music
          still blasting, the upscale throngs still partying.

          INT. STAIRWELL

          Wyatt is bounding up the stairs, rounding the Fifth Floor -
          - when he hears the door overhead bang open, and like a tidal
          wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell.
          Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up
          the stairwell.

          INT.                                                            9TH FLOOR - HALLWAY

          banged open by Jonathan's shoulder.
          The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan
          races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past
          in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925...921...           918...   913...   910...
          Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907.
          He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot --
          when a hand grabs his forearm! He spins in panic to --
          - a CLEANING WOMAN. She says something.in Vietnamese,
          indicating the ringing alarms.

          JONATHAN
          Fire, I know - I'll be out in a minute.
          The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan
          quickly slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green.
          He jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find -

          INT. ROOM 907

          - nothing. The room is freshly made up, no sign of life other
          than A PORNO FILM BLARING from the TV set on Pay-Per-View.
          Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she? He searches
          every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere.
          The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the
          neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the
          incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set --
          Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the TV and shoves it off its
          ledge. It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence.
          Jonathan rubs his brow, heaving in desperation -- when his
          eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the TV was

          resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan
          taps it, he realizes: it's hollow.
          He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall...
          And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: "S".
          Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over. She looks
          semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan
          hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by
          how lifeless she appears -
          - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say
          anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her
          face to his chest.

          âS.,
          (whispers gratefully)
          You're alive.
          He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his
          hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully.

          JONATHAN
          What do you say we stick together from now
          on?

          JA S"
          I'd like that.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          A rush of guests hurriedly descending the staircase, a
          seemingly endless stream of densely packed faces.
          Close on Wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests -
          as he's the only one heading up. He passes the 6th floor...

          Jonathan and "S" hurrying down the hall - Jonathan torn
          between a choice of two stairwells. His eyes dart from one to
          another                                                          - he finally gambles on the one to the right.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          Wyatt forcing his way upstream with menacing determination;
          his gaze is wilder, more and more irritated by the descending
          mob of successful, well-dressed guests he's pushing against --
          - when he halts, peering up through the railings' lozenge-
          shaped opening, past a collection of hands and profiles...
          .to Jonathan and "S" some three stories above.

          TIGHT ON WYATT. As yet unnoticed by Jonathan, he remains
          halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him.
          TIGHTER ON HIS EYES. That predatory gleam.
          EVEN TIGHTER ON HIS GUN, tucked carefully at his side.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" three stories above, starting to
          descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the
          flow of bodies below.
          Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a
          good look. He grips the railing, leans further over... and
          his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him --

          JONATHAN
          He's down there! I saw him -

          11 SIP
          Oh God -

          JONATHAN
          Up - we've got to go up!
          Clutching her arm, Jonathan and "S" turn back up, against the
          flow of traffic. Stories above, less and less people are
          evacuating.
          ANGLE ON WYATT as he presses upward, his steely gaze even
          more rapacious.
          The crowd is thinning as Jonathan and "S" race upward as
          well.
          INSERT JONATHAN'S POV: a shaky, dizzying blur as they race
          higher and higher...
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: from below but gaining on them, Jonathan
          and "S". appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn
          of the staircase...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S", desperately racing upwards...
          CLOSE ON WYATT bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the
          staircase now empty and quiet, save for the footfall of
          Jonathan and "S"                                                 - no more than three floors above Wyatt
          now...
          Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the railing, takes aim...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" still hurrying up - when a shot
          rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the

          - when a second shot rings out, the bullet punching a dent
          into the underside of the stairs just overhead.
          ON WYATT, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the
          stairs even harder in pursuit, all merciless intensity.

          EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

          The party is still at full throttle. Apparently no one has
          yet told them of the alarms.
          CLOSE ON A STAIRWELL DOOR MARKED "EMERGENCY EXIT" as it
          suddenly bangs open and Jonathan and "S" spill out.
          They pause a moment - thrown by the sight of all the wealthy,
          beautiful faces, laughing, dancing.

          JONATHAN
          Come on!
          She grabs his hand, and they waste no time disappearing into
          the mass of bodies.
          They keep moving. Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of
          partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous                - though
          not as smartly attired.
          BACK TO THE STAIRWELL DOOR as Wyatt enters the party,
          scanning the dense crowd, all senses alert.
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: just a mass of successful, attractive,
          partying young men and women. There's no way to pick Jonathan
          and "S" out.
          Wyatt's smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the
          periphery.
          WITHIN THE CROWD "S" clutches Jonathan's hand, their heads
          ducked low as they press forward...
          CLOSE ON WYATT, frustration gnashing at him as he quickens
          his pace, the idiotic enthusiasm of the crowd enraging him,
          sweat beading on his face                                        --
          -- when suddenly the music stops. Wyatt frowns., eyes darting.

          The crowd noise resumes, as the throngs begrudgingly start
          for the exits.
          ON JONATHAN AND "S," doing their best to stay concealed
          within the exiting crowd.
          Angle on Wyatt pushing his way through the crush, shoving
          people aside, trying to find them -
          - when he suddenly stops. He has an idea. He takes out his
          cell phone.
          BACK TO JONATHAN AND "5" within the crowd -
          - when Jonathan's cell phone RINGS.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN as his eyes widen in panic.
          RING... He quickly fumbles for it, tries to turn it off        -
          - but it's too late... WHIP ACROSS THE CROWD to Wyatt,
          grinning wider. He's spotted them. In an instant he is bee-
          lining through the packed suits.
          WIDE SHOT OF THE ROOFTOP as the throngs are clearing out.
          Jonathan grabs "S" as they duck, racing across the dark,
          rooftop, looking for a place to hide.
          They take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge -
          gasping to catch their breath... Stepping back, "S's" foot
          clinks against something: a stray iron railing post.
          She reaches. down for it, starts to lift it -
          - when Wyatt's hand darts in and grasps the other end.
          She looks up in terror - when Wyatt punches her violently,
          knocking her to the ground.
          Jonathan rushes to her - only to be blocked by Wyatt,
          gripping the iron rod tight.

          WYATT
          Nice try back there, Jonathan. Looks like
          you picked up a thing or two from me.
          Jonathan tries to strike him - when with a lightning quick
          movement Wyatt whips the iron rod through the air, cracking
          Jonathan across the face.

          WYATT
          Killer instinct, pall

          Jonathan crumples, his glasses knocked to the ground.
          CLOSE ON WYATT as he grips the iron rod like a tennis
          racquet, steps into position                                   -
          - and brings the rod down on Jonathan with ruthless tennis
          strokes: Backhand! Bam! Forehand! Bam! Slice! Bam!
          Jonathan can barely peer up, bloody and beaten. He hears
          Wyatt drop the iron rod...


          JONATHAN'S POV: Wyatt's blurry figure hovering above suddenly
          swoops in on us  
                                              -
          - as Wyatt grabs Jonathan by the throat, hefts him up and
          yanks him back to the roof's concrete ledge. Jonathan fights
          to struggle free - when Wyatt jams the gun under his chin.
          Jonathan freezes.

          JONATHAN

          (GASPING)
          They'll... catch... you...

          WYATT
          Me? No - no, I'm just a face in the crowd.
          I'm a tourist, just passing through.
          JONATHAN'S POV: Wyatt's face presses closer, now almost in
          focus as he presses Jonathan's torso back over the ledge -

          WYATT
          As for you, you had your fun...
          Wyatt presses closer, crushing Jonathan's back to the edge.

          WYATT
          Now we're going to go back down...
          INSERT JONATHAN'S HAND reaching into Wyatt's pocket, his
          fingers fumbling for the cell phone                            (Jonathan's old phone).

          WYATT
          We're going to get that laptop...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S FINGERS blindly prodding - he has the
          phone now - his fingers feel for the antenna...

          WYATT
          And we're going to finish this, once and
          for -
          - when with all his strength Jonathan jams the cell phone up
          into Wyatt's eye, the antenna punching into the retina.

          Wyatt's grasp slips from Jonathan's collar as he stumbles
          back, cupping a hand to his wound as he swings his gun toward
          Jonathan -
          - when with every ounce of strength Jonathan charges, Wyatt's
          shot missing him as Jonathan slams him into the ledge wall,
          seizing the momentum to turn himself -
          - as Wyatt falls right over the edge of the hotel rooftop...

          vanishing into the vastness of the city below.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN as he crawls to the ledge, peers down into
          the darkness. He exhales, then turns back to "S"                 -
          - to find she's right beside him, grateful tears in her eye.
          She leans into him, and he holds her tight, the two of them
          embraced on the precipice as we

          DISSOLVE TO:

          Strobed reds and blues of police and fire.trucks amassed,
          trying to control the throngs of guests and pedestrians
          blocking our view of the body they're all gawking at.
          We travel through the confusion until we find JONATHAN AND
          "S" sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb, each propped
          against the other.
          The 'shock of it all is beginning to fade. He reaches into his
          pocket and hands her 'Duck on Bike'.

          JONATHAN
          Yours, I believe.

          01S.11
          Thanks, Frank.
          She winds the toy up. They watch it make it's funny way down
          the sidewalk.

          JONATHAN
          Can I ask you something personal?
          She nods.

          What's your name?
          "S" considers the request, then smiles gently, leans in close
          and whispers the answer in his ear. Jonathan gazes at her a
          moment - whatever her name is, it must be perfect.

          JONATHAN
          So what now?
          She smiles up at him.

          S
          Well... are you free tonight?
          On Jonathan: treasuring these moments. He is truly free --
          perhaps for the first time in his life.

          JONATHAN
          Yes. I'm free.
          They gaze at each other.
          We leave Jonathan and "S" to their privacy, pulling back as
          they continue talking, continuing away until we're

          THROUGH A WINDOW AND INSIDE THE HOTEL ITSELF
          the window itself now a frame, letter-boxing the scene,
          people passing like fish in their tank... except for Jonathan
          and S, seated center-frame, two small figures side by side,
          face to face, talking intimately as we.

           Let the record show that I, Olive
           Penderghast, being of sound mind,
           ample breast size and the
           occasional corny knock knock joke,
           do enter this video blog into
           evidence in the case against me.
           Because I'm being judged by a jury
           of my peers, I will attempt to
           insert `like' and `totally' into my
           confession as much as possible. So
           here it goes... I confess I'm, in
           no small part, to blame for the
           vociferous gossip that has turned
           my Varsity letter scarlet, but -
           for anyone hoping that the sizzling
           details of my sordid past will

           lotion - you'll be gravely
           disappointed.

           Look, I just need to set the record

          Olive eats dinner with her family.
                         
          Her father, DILL (40's), is a regular dad-kinda-guy. Her
          mother, ROSEMARY (40's) is heavyset with a fun disposition.
          Also in attendance is her `a-little-too-precious' sister,
          GINGER (12).
                         
          Olive and her folks get along really well.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Hey, you guys know that I was here

           spilling all this dirt, I might as

           I'm trusting that this nugget of
           information isn't going to be
           spread around, but - okay, here it
           goes: My dad's name is Dill and my
           mother's name is Rosemary. They
           were so amused by this that they
           decided to name all of their

          INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          As Olive walks through school, she is met with a totally
          different energy. She no longer blends in. Guys are
          checking her out. Girls are glaring at her, scornfully.
                         
          She's kind of digging it.
                         
           OLIVE (V.O.)
           So, while I would never have
           classified myself as a wallflower,
           I was now the center of attention
           and who doesn't love that? Jeez,
           if I'd known that losing my
           virginity would create such a new
           persona for myself, I'd have lied
           about it back in eighth grade.
           Eighth grade sucked. I did get my
           first kiss back then, however. It
           was gross and kind of turned me off
           to the whole my-tongue-in-other-
           people's-mouths thing. Not to
           mention, the even-worse other-
           people's-tongues-in-MY-mouth thing.
           Seriously, folks. Who invented
           kissing? Why is everyone so dead-
           set on sticking their body parts in
           other people's orifices? If
           there's a hole on a person, rest
           assured, somebody wants to stick
           something of theirs in it.

          INT. CLOSET
                         
          In almost complete darkness, a very nervous EIGHTH GRADE
          OLIVE (13) sits with a scared shitless EIGHTH GRADE KID (13).
                         
          You can hear other PRE-TEENS snickering and whispering
          outside the door.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           So, I think this is the part where
           you're supposed to stick your
           tongue in my mouth. It's just what
           I've heard.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           Just give me a second, okay?
                         
          Olive presses a button and her watch illuminates.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           According to my watch, you have 382
           of them.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           How do you do that?
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           What?
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           Add so fast. And you also talk
           like a grown up.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           Don't worry. I'm not nearly as
           smart as I think I am.
                         
          The kid snickers. He feels a little more at ease.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE (CONT'D)
           I think it's just practice. For
           when I do grow up. Plus, don't
           sweat it. Girls mature faster than
           boys.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           That's what they say.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           And it's probably the reason I'm
           ready to do this and you're not.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           Is it that obvious?
           21.
                         
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           Painfully so.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           So, if we didn't do anything, would
           you tell everybody?
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           Absolutely. I will tell everyone
           you pussied out and the whole
           school will make fun of you and
           you'll most likely spend the rest
           of your teen years as a joke - no,
           even worse - a cautionary tale.
                         
          They both laugh.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           The Kid Who Opted Not To Kiss The

           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           They'll tell it for years. It'll
           be a suburban legend.
                         
          The kid smiles warmly and gratefully at her.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           Thanks, Olive.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           Don't mention it.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           No. YOU don't mention it.
                         
          She extends her pinky to him. They link pinkies and they
          swear on it.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
           We still have five minutes and
           thirty six seconds.
                         
          There's a long silence.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           I'm really interested in politics.

           Oh yeah?

           Well,... Uh.... Cool.
                         
          There's another long silence. Finally, from outside the door
                         --
                         
           PRETEEN KID (O.S.)
           Ewwwww. Hunter Neblett just puked
           all over the dining room.
                         
          Olive and the kid listen as people scurry from outside the
          closet.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           Thank God.

          The kid starts to make his grand escape, but Olive stops him.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE (CONT'D)
           Real fast - and you can tell me the

          The kid smiles.
                         
           EIGHTH GRADE KID
           No. You're very pretty.
                         
          He extends his pinky and she links it to hers. He kisses her
          quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet.
                         
          Olive sits in the closet for a moment, contemplating what
          just happened, wondering if he was telling the truth, then
          she opens the door.
                         
          The coast is clear, except for ANOTHER PRETEEN KID walking
          past. She aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the
          closet with her and, promptly, thrusts her tongue into his
          mouth.
                         
          They make out.

          Olive seems lost in thought. She snaps back to reality and
          the task at hand.

           If I'd known that Meerkat Todd was
           going to turn out so hot, I
           probably would have cherished the
           moment more. I suppose just that
           I'm sitting here reminiscing about
           it means that it must have meant
           something.
           (Beat.)
           Yeah, so anyway - kissing's not
           really my thing. That's what I
           learned in Natalie Giblin's closet.
           I digress...
                         
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
                         
          Olive half-listens in class, while her English teacher MR.
          GRIFFIN (early 30's), a handsome guy, lectures on `THE
          SCARLET LETTER.'
                         
           OLIVE (V.O.)
           So, I'm feeling like the cat's ass,
           because everyone thinks I've been
           deflowered. I'm surprised at how
           empowered I felt by this
           prevarication. I wonder to myself,
           would I feel this invigorated if I
           had actually let some college kid
           violate me in his cockroach-
           infested dorm room? Probably not.
           (Beat.)
           Ironically, we were studying `The
           Scarlet Letter,' but isn't that
           always the way with these teenage
           tales? The literature you read in
           class always seems to have a strong
           connection with whatever angsty
           adolescent drama is being
           recounted. I consider this.
           (Pause.)
           Then I think: Except for
           `Huckleberry Finn.' I don't know
           any teenage boys who have ever run
           away with a big, hulking black guy.

          Marianne, who's an office aid, has a smirk on her face as she
          watches Olive squirm. She slams her fist down on the

           Calm down, Adolph. There's a vein
           popping out of your neck. I'm
           simply suggesting that maybe these
           kids we call peers have got the
           right idea. Maybe Bridget
           Schumacher isn't as hippy-dippy as
           she pretends to be. Maybe that's
           just the label she's put on herself
           to avoid having to bathe as often
           as society deems necessary. Or
           take Marianne Bryant. It's
           convenient for her to act like a
           stuck-up Jesus-freak.
           (Thinking about this)
           No. I'm wrong. I think she's
           actually just a stuck-up Jesus-
           freak. But do you think she cares
           that that's the way she's
           perceived? No. Maybe she was just
           sick of being just another
           nameless, faceless entity in a
           place and a time that reveres
           people for extremity?
                         
          Brandon realizes why she's chosen this path and feels for
          her.
                         
                          BRANDON
           There are some of us, though, that
           want to just blend in to the crowd.

           Then maybe you need to go to that
           extreme. Or make the steadfast
           decision not to care. Even better
           if you can manage to do both.

          him behind her back.
                         
          She spins around and they instantly pretend to not be paying

          begins another one.

          Olive sews these red scraps to her clothes. When she
          finishes one piece, as before, she tosses it behind her and
          grabs another item from the crumpled wardrobe on her floor.

          until there are none left.

          Clad in sunglasses, fuck-me-boots and looking like a bona
          fide porn star, Olive struts down the halls of her school.
          Sewn across her larger and pushed up breasts is
                         
          A FIERY RED `A'

          clothing will be emblazoned with a RED A.)
                         
          Erections are popping up all along the halls, as well as
          looks of total disbelief from the girls.
                         
          She works it like a Debbie Who Just Did Dallas, Düsseldorf,
          Des Moines, Daytona, Detroit and Darfur.
                         
          Up ahead, Rhiannon is yakking with a semi-attractive guy
          named ANSON (17). She catches sight of Olive and her jaw
          drops.
                         
          Olive sidles up to Anson, much to Rhiannon's chagrin.

          She rubs her knee, seductively, along his inner thigh, turns
          and licks her lips at a repulsed Rhiannon and continues on
          her way.

          class. A TERRIFIED FAT KID named EVAN nervously approaches
          her.

           Evan, if you're watching this -
           shame on you. I hope you never
           treat another girl the way you
           treated me or you will die alone,
           wishing it was because you're fat.
           And since we're playing the shame
           game... While I appreciate the
           sentiment, Lewis, a pretend hand
           job should have warranted a little
           more than a hundred dollars worth
           of AMC Movie Passes. They had an
           expiration date AND were only able
           to be used for movies that had been
           running for two weeks. But even
           that's better than Tyler Jennings,
           who gave me a ten percent off
           coupon to Bath and Body Works.
           Seriously. A fucking coupon. Is
           that how good my imaginary blow job
           was to you? Huh? Is chivalry
           dead? I want John Cusack holding a
           boombox outside my window. I want
           Richard Gere climbing up my fire
           escape with the limo waiting
           downstairs. I want to ride off on
           a lawnmower with Patrick Dempsey.
           Although, I'm ashamed to admit I'd
           prefer him to look like he looks
           now. What woman wouldn't? But no.
           I get to save two fifty on a bottle
           of Juniper Breeze Hand Lotion.
           Maybe chivalry isn't dead, but it's
           in a coma and the prognosis isn't
           good.

           me extra credit for going the extra
           mile. I'm really attempting to
           understand this puritanical
           ostracism.

           Hey, I'm really sorry I had to send
           you to the Principal. If you tell
           anybody, I'll deny it, but I really
           wanted to cheer with the rest of

          Her boyfriend, MICAH (17) takes her hand and holds it. She
          leans against his shoulder, wiping away tears. Nina, on the
          other side of her, begins rubbing her shoulder,
          sympathetically.

           get her to see that what she's
           doing is wrong?

           asking me to do things and I
           thought it was okay, because it
           wasn't real.

           Well. It's not a good thing.

           Right. Okay. Let's say hell
           exists. Which is worse - lying or
           adultery? Or is lying about
           adultery like a double whammy?

          after school today? Kisses! Marianne
                         
          Marianne looks back and Olive gives her the thumbs up.

          both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably.

           LOVE YOU and I want to be with you
           and no one can stop us. Not my
           mother, not Marianne, not --
                         
          There's a dial tone.
                         
                         
          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Mrs. Griffin has just hung up on her teenage lover and begins
          freaking out. She grabs a cardboard box and begins throwing
          items into it.
                         
          Olive bursts into Mrs. Griffin's office and sees Mrs. Griffin
          packing her things.
                         
          As we saw before --
           82.
                         
                         
           MRS. GRIFFIN
                          (SNAPPING)
           What?! What do you want?
                         
          Olive starts to say something, but Mrs. Griffin can't even
          look at her.
                         
           MRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
           Just go!
                         
          She throws a framed photo of her and Mr. Griffin into the
          box. It shatters. Mrs. Griffin falls apart.
                         
          Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know
          what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave --
                         
          -- and then feels awkward.
                         
                          OLIVE
           I'm sorry, I was just looking for
           Marianne. Did she say something
           about being mad at me? She just
           smacked the shi -- `crap' out of
           me.
                         
          This makes Mrs. Griffin cry even harder. She attempts to
          pull herself together.
                         
           MRS. GRIFFIN
           It's my fault. I'm so sorry,
           Olive.
                         
          Olive looks at her, quizzically.
                         
           MRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D)

                          OLIVE
           Don't get me wrong. I love it, but
           I don't think you're supposed to
           use those words around a student.
                         
           MRS. GRIFFIN
           Yeah, well, you're not to supposed
           to fuck them, either. But it
           didn't stop me.
                         
          Olive puts two and two together in her head. She gasps a
          little louder than she planned.
           83.

           Wait. What does that have to do
           with me?
                         
          Mrs. Griffin walks over and locks her office door. She
          fights back more tears, as she tries to explain to Olive.
                         
           OLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           My guidance counselor, who had only
           days before armed me with a latex
           bulletproof vest, told me that she
           had chlamydia and that she had been
           screwing around with her office
           aide's boyfriend under the guise of
           divorce counseling. She confided
           in me that she and her husband - my
           favorite teacher - were having
           marital problems, that they hadn't
           slept together in months. She
           assured me that she had never meant
           for anything to happen with Micah.
           She confessed to me how when she
           was a child she always dreamt of
           being Maria Von Trapp, not Mary Kay
           Letorneau. Micah had panicked and
           used me as a scapegoat - to save
           her job and her marriage. She
           assured me that she would make sure
           everyone knew the truth and
           apologized.
                         
          Mrs. Griffin stops talking and waits for Olive to speak.
                         
           OLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And I bought it.
                         
          Olive gives her a reassuring smile, steps up to the plate and
          offers up a solution.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           I could have chlamydia. And I
           could easily have given it to
           Micah. That time we slept
           together. Who knows? Often times
           women don't have symptoms and I
           have been whoring around....

          Olive looks at her, puzzled by her knowledge.
                         
           MRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D)

           to herself, let alone others.
                         
          She begins to weep.
                         
          Olive puts her hand on Mrs. Griffin's shoulder.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Call Micah. Tell him I said he's
           an asshole and that he owes me SO
           big for this and also the time I
           pretended not to see him during a
           third grade game of hide and seek.
           Tell him I still remember that.
           But tell him that I confessed to
           giving him chlamydia.
                         
          Mrs. Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           And it's not really my place to say
           this, but I figure after the
           conversation we just had, I can
           speak candidly. Your husband is
           HOT and while the male adolescent
           can fuck like a bunny... who really
           wants to fuck a bunny? If I was
           you, I'd go home and seduce him and
           pretend this never happened.
                         
          Olive strokes her guidance counselor's hair.

           With all the mythical play I was
           getting, it's a wonder - and
           probably a miracle - that I still
           hadn't actually been asked out on a
           real date. Guys were clamoring to
           claim that they'd slept with me,

           moves on me. Until finally...

           It was really Rhiannon who had a

           were kids.
                         
          Rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek.
          Repulsed, he wipes his face.
                         
          Rhiannon and Olive high five each other.

           substantiated claims that any
           particular food increases sexual
           desire or performance. It's so
           funny when guys ply women with food
           that they think is gonna get them
           laid. I mean, what's really sexy
           about slurping back oysters? You
           know, native people believed that
           you gained the strength of the
           animal by consuming it. Some
           people grind up rhinoceros horn,
           because it's thought to stiffen the
           male sex organ. It's all bullshit.
           And spanish fly? It's pulverized
           beetle that people eat! Although,
           it's illegal for human consumption
           in the United States and do you
           know why? Because if you take just
           a bit too much, it causes painful
           urination, fever and bloody
           discharge.
                         
          A SERVER appears with their LOBSTER. Anson is an odd shade
          of green from Olive's little science lesson.

           I didn't know Meerkat Todd worked
           here! And he's a lobster! I
           wonder if I should start calling
           him Lobster Todd.

          They land at the table of the birthday girl. Olive cranes
          her neck to see --
                         
          Rhiannon, miserable of course, sitting with her parents at a
          table in the next room. Olive immediately becomes uneasy.

                          ANSON

           and I'd die. It sucks I know.
                         
          Even more confused, the server obliges and gives them their
          check.

                          ANSON

                          ANSON
           I think so. For instance, I, too
           think Nina Howell's a twat.

           Haven't you?
                         
          Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit
          pissed.
                         
                          ANSON (CONT'D)

          The server reappears with the check.

          The sever smiles and leaves them again.
                         
                          ANSON

          They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down,
          but Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if
          Rhiannon sees them.
                         
          She does.
                         
          Olive and Rhiannon make eye contact. Whereas, Olive looks
          remorseful, Rhiannon looks like she's just been stabbed in
          the back -- which she has.
                         
          The Abernathys see her, as well, and wave. It's painfully
          obvious to Olive that Rhi hasn't told her parents about their
          differences. She starts to go over, but Rhiannon's face is
          turning vermillion in anger. Olive just waves, sheepishly
          and leaves with Anson.

          Olive's face is painted with guilt. She feels like shit, but
          doesn't want to externalize it.
                         
          Anson puts his hand on her knee.
                         
                          ANSON
           I have something for you.
                         
          Olive manages a smile. He reaches into his pocket and pulls
          out a $500 GIFT CERTIFICATE to ANTHROPOLOGIE and hands it to
          her.
                         
          Olive is disappointed, but tries not to show it.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Oh. I didn't realize --
                         
          Snapping out of her guilt.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)

           Whatever $500 gets me.
                         
          He leans over and kisses her. She pushes him off.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Wait. This isn't how it works. I
           don't actually --
                         
          But he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly. She
          pushes him off again.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           You don't get it. I'm not
           technically having sex with people
           for money. You know that, right?
           Besides, even if I was, we're in
           the parking lot of a Red Lobster.
                         
                          ANSON
           We can go wherever you want, but I
           think it would be kind of hot here.
                         
          He takes off his shirt.

          She gets out of the car. He rolls down the window.

          He drives off, leaving her outside in the parking lot.

           that. In that way. At all. I

          Rhi puts her head down.
                         
          The drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume.
          He jumps around enthusing the student body --

          Meerkat Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive, dressed
          in a glittery and slinky RED DRESS, with a BOA draped around
          her bare shoulder, pops up and croons with a handheld mic and

          off - and she's quite good.

          and howl at her sheer brilliance.
                         
          She begins to rub her hands seductively over Meerkat Todd's
          furry costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the

          her.

                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           (To the student body)
           This is just a free preview. For
           the main event log on to
           www.freeolivep.com tonight at 6
           p.m. Now, I know this conflicts
           with tonight's basketball game, but
           c'mon would you rather be here
           cheering on the Meerkats
           (Looking at Todd,
                          LASCIVIOUSLY)
           or watch me do one.
                         
          There are audible gasps, but excitement nonetheless.
                         
          Gibbons angrily storms over and takes the microphone.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
           (Through gritted teeth)
           Young lady, to my office. NOW.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Yeah, I can't. I'm gonna go bang
           my boyfriend while the whole school
           watches. But good luck with the
           game-thing. Go Meerkats.
                         
          She plods out, triumphantly.
                         
                         
          INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
                         
          The sun is setting as Olive speaks into her webcam. But this
          time, we're not seeing it through the lens, but from a
          different point in the room.
           108.
                         
                         
                          OLIVE
           And here you all are. Waiting
           outside the closet door for me to
           kiss Todd, listening to me pretend
           to have sex with Brandon, paying me
           to lie for you, calling probably
           the last virgin in school a whore.
           Guys. Seriously.
                         
          All of a sudden -- from outside and downstairs --
                         
          James' `LAID' begins to play.
                         
          Olive goes over to the window and sees Todd below, holding up
          a BOOMBOX (a la John Cusack) and there's a RIDE-ON LAWN MOWER
          (a la Patrick Dempsey) behind him.
                         
          Upon seeing this, she bursts into laughter, but it couldn't
          be more romantic.
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
                          (SHOUTING DOWN)
           Who told you that I loved this
           song?
                         
                          MEERKAT TODD
                          (SHOUTING UP)
           I guessed.
                         
                          OLIVE
           I see you've been watching my live
           webcast. It's still going on, you
           know.
                         
                          MEERKAT TODD
           Fuck them. They've had enough of
           you. Well, figuratively speaking.
           I borrowed my neighbor's John
           Deere. Come down here.
                         
                          OLIVE
           That rhymed.
                         
                          MEERKAT TODD
           Intentionally.
                         
                          OLIVE
           Be right down.
                         
          Olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to
          the camera.
                         
          We see her through the lens.
           109.
                         
                         
                          OLIVE (CONT'D)
           That's Todd. Not that I owe any of
           you any more confessions, but I'm
           really in love with him. And I am
           going to lose my virginity to him.
           I'm not sure when. It could happen
           five minutes from now or tonight or
           six months from now or maybe on our
           wedding night, but the really
           amazing thing is that it's nobody's
           business.
           (As an afterthought)
           Like, totally.
                         
          She turns the camera off.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE PENDERGHAST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Olive runs out of the house and tackles him, kissing him -
                         
          in the front yard,
                         
          in broad daylight,
                         
          for the world to see.
                         
           FADE OUT.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          OVER THE END CREDITS...
                         
                         
          EXT. GYM - NIGHT
                         
          The basketball game is going on to an almost empty gymnasium.
                         
                         
                         MONTAGE
                         
          We see, from the perspective of their computer screens,
          various reactions to Olive's webcast --
                         
          -- A proud Brandon watches from a hotel room. A MUSCULAR
          BLACK GUY in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck.
                         
          -- The Abernathys watch with the same demented glee they
          derive from watching anything.
                         
          -- Mrs. Griffin watches with the face of a person who's been
          found out and who's days are numbered. They are.
           110.
                         
                         
          -- Rhi seems contemplative. Maybe it's because she's been in
          love with Olive since grade school. Duh.
                         
          -- Evan, the fat kid, is doing jumping jacks while watching.
                         
          -- Melanie Bostic (the host of the party) watches with a
          group of girls.
                         
                          MELANIE
                          (SATISFIED)
           Told you guys. Pay up.
                         
          -- Marianne feels regret. But a little bit impressed.
                         
          -- Mr. Griffin is proud of her.
                         
          -- Micah watches in his dark bedroom.
                         
           MICAH'S GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
           Micah? What are you doing in
           there?
                          (STERNLY)
           You had better not be on the sin-
           ternet.
                         
          -- Rosemary and Dill are too busy making out to watch.
                         
          -- Anson has a jar of vaseline and is ready to jerk off, but
          is upset that she isn't `exposing herself' in the
          aforementioned way.
                         
                          ANSON
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           I thought she was going to take her
           clothes off.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE PENDERGHAST HOUSE - HOURS LATER
                         
          Olive and Todd are still kissing on the lawn underneath the
          stars.
                         
           FADE OUT.

				OLD KIM
		Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		Why is it snowing, grandma? Where does it come 
		from?
		
				OLD KIM
		Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		I want to hear.
		
				OLD KIM
		Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.
		
				OLD KIM
		Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would 
		have to start with scissors.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		Scissors?
		
				OLD KIM
		Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once 
		there was even a man who had scissors for 
		hands.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		A man?
		
				OLD KIM
		Yes.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		Hands, scissors?
		
				OLD KIM
		No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top 
		of the mountain?
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		It's haunted.
		
				OLD KIM
		Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in 
		that mansion. He made many things, I suppose. 
		He also created a man. He gave him inside, a 
		heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost 
		everything. You see, the inventor was very old. 
		He died before he got to finish the man he 
		invented. So the man was left by himself, 
		incomplete and all alone.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		He didn't have a name?
		
				OLD KIM
		Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward.
		
				PEG
		Avon calling.
		
				HELEN
		Weren't you just here?
		
				PEG
		No, not since last season. Today I've come to 
		show you our exquisite new line of soft colors 
		in shadows, blushes and lipstick. Everything 
		you need to accent and highlight your changing 
		looks.
		
				HELEN
		My changing looks? That's good.
			(Helen chuckles)
		
				PEG
		Well, it goes that saying and I also have a 
		complete selection of your old favorites, those 
		tried-and-true products we've all come to 
		depend on year-in and year-out.
		
				HELEN
		Come on, Peg. I never buy anything from you. 
		You know that?
		
				PEG
		I know. Bye, Helen.
		
				REPAIRMAN
		You know, you didn't have to call me, ma'am. 
		You could have taken care of this by yourself.
		
				JOYCE
		I could? I don't think so.
		
				REPAIRMAN
		Yeah, you see, it's easy. The food trap's 
		clogged. That's all. You see this bolt here? 
		You just unscrew this. OK? And out she pops.
		
				JOYCE
		You know, on TV they say you repairmen are 
		lonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely 
		too. Although you may not realize it since they 
		haven't made a commercial on the subject.
		
				REPAIRMAN
		And then you just take this and put it back in 
		here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it, 
		because it fits in there by itself. And then 
		you just screw this back on.
			(The bell rings.)
		
				JOYCE
		On no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me 
		for a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be 
		right back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't 
		want to miss a moment of it.
		
				PEG
		Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling.
		
				JOYCE
		Why! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see 
		there's a vehicle in my driveway?
		
				PEG
		Oh, yes.
		
				JOYCE
		Well, I'm surprised you don't realize that 
		means I'm busy. 
			(Joyce shuts the door with a 
			bang.)
		
				PEG
		Okay. Now, we should decide on lipsticks. Okay, 
		dear, what one did you like best? There was the 
		Winsome Wahini which looked charming on you. Or 
		the Bahenie Bliss.
		
				A GIRL
		I like them both.
		
				PEG
		Well, great.
		
				A GIRL
		You don't actually think I have any money, do 
		you?
			(Peg gets in her car.)
		
				CHILDREN
		Ding, dong, the Avon lady.
		
				PEG
		It's just not my day.
			(Disappointed Peg sees a mansion 
			through her rearview mirror and 
			drives to the place. She is 
			attracted by the beautiful garden 
			there and enters the mansion.)
		
				PEG
		Oh, my goodness.
		
				PEG
		Oh, it's so beautiful. Hello?
			(Birds flying)
		Hello? Avon calling, oh my. Hello, I'm Peg 
		Boggs. I'm your local Avon representative. 
		Hello. I'm sorry to barge in like this. But you 
		don't have any reason to be afraid. This is 
		some huge house, isn't it? Thank goodness for 
		those aerobics classes.
			(Snipping)
		
				PEG
		Hello. Hello. Why are you hiding back there? 
		You don't have to hide from me. I'm Peg Boggs. 
		I'm your local Avon representative and I'm as 
		harmless as cherry pie. 
			(Peg sees Edward's scissorhands.)
		Oh my! I can see that I've disturbed you. How 
		stupid of me! I'll just be going now.
		
				EDWARD
		Don't go.
		
				PEG
		Oh my! What happened to you?
		
				EDWARD
		I'm not finished.
		
				PEG
		Uh, put those down. Don't come any closer. Just 
		please... Those are your hands? Those are your 
		hands. What happened to you? Where are your 
		parents? Hum... Your mother? Your father?
		
				EDWARD
		He didn't wake up.
		
				PEG
		Are you alone? Do you live up here all by 
		yourself? What happened to your face? Hum, you 
		know, I won't hurt you. But at the very least 
		let me give you a good astringent and this will 
		help to prevent infection. What's your name?
		
				EDWARD
		Edward.
		
				PEG
		Edward? I think you should just come home with 
		me.
			(Peg takes Edward to her home)
		
				PEG
		Oh!
		
				EDWARD
		I'm-I'm sorry.
		
				PEG
		No, Don't be. You go ahead and look you have 
		every reason to be excited.
		
				PEG
		Oh! Are you ok?
		
				EDWARD
		Are you ok?
			(Ring)
		
				HELEN
		Hello.
		
				MARGIE
		Hi, it's Margie. Listen, I was standing outside 
		talking to Carol and Peg drove by, she had 
		somebody in the car.
		
				HELEN
		Did you get a good look?
		
				MARGIE
		No, did she say anything to you, about having 
		guest?
		
				HELEN
		She didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell 
		early this morning.
		
				MARGIE
		No, ok, I'll meet you on the corner. Right, 
		Bye.
			(Birds signal)
		
				HELEN
		Oh, damn!
		
				PEG
		Here we go, dear. This is our house. And you 
		can just go right in and make yourself right at 
		home. OK? And just, well have something to eat 
		or drink, whatever you... Here, dear. Here 
		you... This is the front door here, Here we go, 
		right in here.
			(A woman talks on the phone)
		
				A WOMAN
		Joyce, I just saw this strange guy drop in with 
		Peg. I didn't get a very good look at him. He 
		looked kind of pale. Okay, I'll be right there. 
		Don't do anything without me. Okay? Bye.
		
				JOYCE
		Yes, I'll be right there.
		
				PEG
		Here we are. So, oh, this is the living room 
		and back here, the bedrooms. You want to see 
		the pictures? All right. Well, this is my 
		husband, Bill. He's a bowling champion. Do you 
		know what bowling is? Bowling? Well, here they 
		are down at the lake, fishing. I think Kevin 
		looks a little glum Because they didn't catch 
		anything that day. And here's my daughter, Kim. 
		All dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior 
		now. I can't believe it. She's camping in the 
		mountains with some friends, but she'll be back 
		in a few days and you can meet her then. Isn't 
		she beautiful? That's my family. Now, go on, 
		dear. I'll show you the rest of the house. Then 
		you can just freshen up and make yourself at 
		home. Okay? That's the kitchen over there. You 
		help yourself to anything you want to eat or 
		drink. Those are grapes. Back here are the 
		bedrooms. Let me get you some towels, then I 
		will see what we can find to wear. You know 
		what? I think I have some of Bill's old clothes 
		in here. This is perfect. Here. These should 
		just fit you. 
			(The phone rings.)
		Oh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a 
		phone. Now you can go in Kim's room and put 
		these on. I'll be right with you.
		
				PEG
		No, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was 
		born up there or something. Have you seen him 
		before? No, I don't think he's been off the 
		grounds before today. You're kidding. How did 
		you get together with him? I have to go. I'll 
		talk to you later Margie, Bye-bye.
			(to Edward)
		I'm sorry Edward, I didn't... oh, dear. May I 
		help you with this?
		
				EDWARD
		Thank you.
		
				PEG
		There you go. Oh, dear, you've cut your face. 
		Let me get this right off. Does that hurt? 
		Okay. No, good. Now let's get you dressed. 
		Okay. There we go. Very fine. You look fine, 
		just fine. Come on, we can't wait for you. 
		You've got rollers in your damn hair.
		
				PEG
		Okay. Now what did I do with my sci... Edward, 
		um, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor 
		friend who I think could help you.
		
				EDWARD
		Really?
		
				PEG
		Yes, I can help with the scars. I just want to 
		consult the Avon handbook before doing 
		anything.
		
				PEG
		Kevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it 
		would make you feel if somebody were staring at 
		you.
		
				KEVIN
		I wouldn't care.
		
				PEG
		Well, I would, so don't do it!
		
				BILL
		This must be quite a change for you, Ed.
		
				PEG
		I think he prefers Edward.
		
				BILL
		Sure. So what have you been doing up there in 
		that big old place? I bet the view must be 
		spectacular, Ed.
		
				PEG
		I was just...
		
				BILL
		See all the way to the ocean?
		
				EDWARD
		Sometimes.
		
				PEG
		Bill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank 
		you.
		
				KEVIN
		Man, those things are cool. You know I bet 
		they're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's 
		neck...
		
				PEG
		Would you like some butter for your bread?
		
				PEG
		Great.
		
				EDWARD
		Thank you.
		
				KEVIN
		Can I bring him to show and tell on Monday?
		
				PEG
		I've had enough.
		
				PEG
			(to Edward)
		You think you can sleep? Things feel strange 
		now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good 
		night.
			(Peg tries to cover Edward's 
			scars.)
		
				PEG
		The light concealing cream goes on first, then 
		you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the 
		secret. More concealing for you? But you 
		complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of 
		lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close 
		enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I 
		have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and 
		start with a completely smooth surface. Don't

		Hartely into the windup and the strike one

				BILL
		Turn it up, Kevin. I can't hear it. Kevin! No,

		Hartely's strike two pitch is hammered.
		
				KEVIN
		You hear that, Mr. Boggs?
		
				BILL
		No, make it louder.  Sports announcements on 
		
				RADIO
		It's going way back. It's gone. It's out of 
		here. It is history.
		
				KEVIN
		Dad, look!  Sports announcements on 
		
				RADIO
		A grand slam for Martinez to make it a five-run 
		inning and blow this game to pieces.
		
				BILL
		I'll be darned.
		
				PEG
		They filled the whole tape.
			(Peg listens to the recorded 
			phones.)
		
				RECORDED VOICES
		What's going on over there, Peg. Call me....Hi, 
		it's Margie. Who is he? Call me. Oh, by the 
		way, here it's pouring rain in the mountains. 
		You think the kids are okay?...Hi, there, 
		darling. The gals are all in a tizzy about your 
		secret visitor. You can't keep him a secret 
		forever.
		
				BILL
		Boy, it's just wonderful, Ed. My god, you, you 
		have the whole family in there, don't you?
		
				KEVIN
		Edward, come here.
			(Kevin cleans Edward's 
			scissorhands with water.)
		
				BILL
		No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, son. Go to 
		the garage and get the oil can. We don't want 
		him rusting up on this now, do we?
		
				PEG
		Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us.
		
				BILL
		Yes, it is.
		
				PEG
		Oh, Edward.
			(Esmeralda comes near.)
		
				ESMERALDA
		It's not heaven he's from. It's straight from 
		the stinking flames of hell. The power of satan 
		is in him. I can feel it. God, you have the 
		poor sheep strayed so far from the path.
		
				EDWARD
		We are not sheep.
		
				ESMERALDA
		Don't come near me.
		
				BILL
		That's right. Go on. Get out of here. Run!
		
				PEG
		Edward, don't you listen to her.
		
				BILL
		Don't worry about her, Edward. She's just an 
		old lonely loony. That's all.
			(Women knock on the door.)
		
				WOMEN
		Hi!
		
				JOYCE
		You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old 
		hermit crabs.
		
				PEG
		Hi, Joyce. Hi!
		
				JOYCE
		Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to 
		yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of 
		you.
		
				PEG
		No, it, it's... things have just been a little 
		hectic around here. That's all.
		
				JOYCE
		Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct 
		the situation. What time does the barbecue 
		begin?
		
				PEG
		Barbecue?
		
				JOYCE
		Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality 
		by introducing him to your friends, don't you?
		
				ANOTHER WOMAN
		I'll bring coleslaw.
		
				JOYCE
		And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time 
		was it that you said?
		
				PEG
		What time? Ah... bill.
		
				JOYCE
		About five?
		
				ESMERALDA
		He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's 
		not too late. You must push him from you. Expel 
		him. Trample down the perversion of nature.
		
				JOYCE
		Did you hear that? He's the perversion of 
		nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you 
		later. Bye bye.
		
				PEG
		I've always said that you really can't have a 
		picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs. 
		They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh, 
		dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know 
		you chopped all those things. What a really 
		big...
			(Peg notices a cut on his face.)
		Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no 
		need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda 
		won't be here and the rest of neighbors there 
		are really very nice. There's no need to be 
		nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You 
		just have to be yourself.
		
				EDWARD
		Myself?
		
				PEG
		That's right. Just your own sweet self.
		
				KEVIN
		Hey, play scissors, paper, stone with us.
		
				EDWARD
		Play scissors what?
		
				NEIGHBOR
		I got a doctor friend might be able to help 
		you. Aren't they most incredible?
		
				PEG
		He did them just like that.
		
				TINKA
		This afternoon?
		
				AT THE PARTY
		Hi, Mike. How are you doing? Hello, Jack. Hey, 
		kid. Hey, Hi. George Morroe! Whoa! That's a 
		heck of handshake. Uh, Harry! Harry! I saw you 
		on the golf course. You got a dozen of the 
		melons...
		
				PEG
			(to Edward)
		Are you ok?  Do you want something to eat?  Are 
		you hungry? Do you want a cracker?
		
				MARGIE
		He's so... different completely different, No 
		kidding mysterious.
		
				JOYCE
		Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold? 
		Just think what a single snip could do.
		
				HELEN
		Or undo.
		
				GEORGE
			(to Edward)
		Eddie.  The guys and I were talking, we'd like 
		want to invite you to our card game on Friday 
		night. Would you like that? Only thing is, you 
		can't cut.
		
				AN OLD MAN
		I have my own infirmity. Never did me a bit of 
		harm. Took some shrapnel during the war and 
		ever since then I can't feel a thing. Not a 
		damn thing. Listen Don't you ever let anybody 
		tell you you have a handicap.
		
				JOYCE
		Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be 
		ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're... 
		What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's 
		Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted 
		any of the ambrosia salad that I made 
		especially for you. Allow me. 
			(Joyce helps Edward to eat.)
		
				WOMAN 1
		You must try this.
			(Many women flock to him)
		
				MARGE
			(to Edward)
		You must try this.  It's my mother's recipe. 
		Let him chew, for heaven sakes with your green 
		thumb. I could use your help.
		
				HOUSEWIFE
		Me, too. There you go.
		
				WOMAN 2
		I want a row of angels.
		
				JOYCE
		Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my 
		house first.
		
				WOMAN 3
		One more.
		
				JOYCE
		Haven't you, Eddie?
		
				EDWARD
		I did?
		
				BILL
		Okay, everybody. Grab your plates. Soup's on.
		
				EDWARD
		I thought it was shish kebab.
		
				BILL
		What?
		
				EDWARD
		I thought it was shish kebab.
		
				BILL
		Yeah, it, it is shish kebab. It was a figure of 
		speech, Ed. You got to learn not to take things 
		so literally.
			(On hearing that, Edward looks 
			back the time the inventor taught 
			him the etiquette.)
		
				INVENTOR
		Let us pretend we're in the drawing room, and 
		the hostess is serving tea "Now, many numerous 
		little questions confront us" "Should the man 
		rise" "When he accepts his cup of tea?" "May 
		lump sugar be taken with the things?"
		
				EDWARD
		Hmm, no.
		
				INVENTOR
		Is it good form to accept a second cup? "Now, 
		should the napkin be entirely unfolded." Oh 
		should the center crease. Be allowed to remain? 
		It is so easy to commit embarrassing 
		blunders. "But etiquette humiliation and
		discomfort. Mmm yes, boring. Let us switch to, 
		Um... To some poetry, Hmm?" "There was an old 
		man from the cape." "Who made himself there, 
		but they keep such a beautiful shape." That's 
		right. Go ahead, smile. It's funny. That's 
		right.
		
				DENNY
		Okay, guys, we're home. shh.
		
				KIM
		I can't believe. Everything's still sopping.
		
				TEENAGE GIRL
		I can't wait to take a shower.
		
				SUZANNE
		And wash off the mildew.
		
				JIM
		If my parents set the alarm, I'm screwed I'll 
		sleep in the yard... again.
		
				KIM
		I told you to call to say we're coming back 
		early.
		
				DENNY
		Did you?
		
				SUZANNE
		He'd rather complain.
		
				JIM
		How else can I be the center of the attention? 
		You didn't call your parents.
		
				KIM
		They don't run their house like a police 
		station. Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny. See 
		you later.
		
				JIM
		See you later. Bye.
		
				KIM
		Don't forget your arm.
		
				JIM
		Oh, yeah.
		
				DENNY
		Come on, Jim let's go.
		
				KIM
		Bill! There's somebody in my room. Go. Look. A 
		murderer with an axe. He did try to even kill 
		me.
		
				BILL
		It's all right. It's all right. 
			( to Kevin)
		Go back to bed. It's only Edward.
			(to Edward)
		This way.
		
				PEG
		Honey, that was Edward.
		
				KIM
		Who is he? What are you talking about?
		
				PEG
		Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing 
		to be upset about. No, no. It's okay.
		
				BILL
		We'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up 
		with your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do 
		you like that? It's all made up and everything. 
		There you go. What's the matter? What's wrong? 
		She gets you nervous? You've been closed up in 
		a way in that castle too long.  You don't know 
		anything about the wonderful world of teen-age 
		girls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten 
		that out.
		
				EDWARD
		What is it?
		
				BILL
		Lemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a 
		certain age. They develop these gland things. 
		Their bodies swell up. They go crazy.
		
				EDWARD
		Glands?
		
				BILL
		yeah, glands. I try not to think about it
			(Edward drinks lemonade.)
		Good. Isn't it?
			(Peg calms down Kim.)
		
				PEG
		Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow 
		we'll fix your room right.
		
				KIM
		Mom, why did you have to bring him in here?
		
				PEG
		Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all 
		alone. You would have done the same thing.
		
				KIM
		Why does he have to stay here?
		
				PEG
		Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He 
		can't help the way he is. Have a little 
		sympathy.
		
				KIM
		I do have a little sympathy.
		
				PEG
		Then let's just say hello and later you can 
		come downstairs and shake his hand.
		
				KIM
		Shake his hand?
		
				PEG
		Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him 
		half to death.
		
				KIM
		I scared him to death?
		
				PEG
		Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a 
		proper introduction. Edward, this is our 
		daughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going 
		to live with us.
		
				KIM
		Hi! 
			(Edward falls on the floor.)
		
				JOYCE
			(to Edward)
		Eddie. Thirsty? 
			(to Kisses)
		Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear 
		myself think. Momma's precious little baby 
		girl.
			(to Edward)
		Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of 
		lemonade?
		
				EDWARD
		Lemonade?
			(Vomits)
			(Bell rings)
		
				KEVIN
		One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over. 
		They're the sharpest things in the world. They 
		can hack through anything. And...
		
				KIM
		I think they look weird. They give me the 
		creeps.
		
				A GIRL
		You should see the clown in front of Ms. 
		Peter's yard.
		
				EDWARD
		Kim!
		
				KIM
		Oh, no!
		
				A GIRL
		That's him?
		
				JIM
		He's calling you, Kim.
		
				KIM
		Stop it.
		
				A WOMAN
		Edward, you forgot your cookies.
		
				JIM
		Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you.
		
				A GIRL
		Let's go.
		
				PEG
		Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had 
		lunch at Jackie's today.
		
				BILL
		Really?
		
				PEG
		She's just had her kitchen completely redone.
		
				BILL
		I'll be darned.
		
				PEG
		New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new 
		microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher.
		
				BILL
		Yeah, isn't that wonderful?
		
				PEG
		Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me 
		your mom had her kitchen done too?
		
				JIM
		Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new 
		toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four 
		heads.
		
				PEG
		My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be 
		that rich.
		
				JIM
		No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My 
		father has his own room for his stuff to make 
		sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he 
		won't help me buy my own car.
		
				BILL
		Well, he probably wants you to pay for it 
		yourself. I agree with him. It builds 
		character. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking 
		of money, I understand you are not charging for 
		gardening, Edward?
		
				PEG
		Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.
		
				BILL
		Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of 
		life with cookies. You can't buy car with 
		cookies. Am I right, Jim?
		
				JIM
		Ah, that's true, sir. You can't.
			(Edward gives a piece of meat to 
			Kim's friend.)
		
				A GIRL
		I can't eat that. He used his hands. I don't 
		think it's sanitary.
			(Edward passes the piece to Kim 
			but drops it in her lap by 
			mistake.)
		
				EDWARD
		I'm sorry.
		
				PEG
		Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?
		
				KIM
		No, that's okay. I'll be right back. 
			(Edward begins styling women's 
			hair and becomes famous.)
		
				HOUSEWIFE
		This can't possibly be my Alexis.
			(to Edward)
		She looks so beautiful. Look at you. She's 
		gorgeous. Thank you.
		
				PEG
		It won't be long. She has just to decide on the 
		style, and then it will be fine. She just has 
		to decide what style she wants.
		
				JOYCE
		I was hoping for something big and bouffant. 
		Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses. 
		You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything 
		you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear. 
		Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair? 
		Would you cut mine? That was the single most 
		thrilling experience of my whole life.
		
				PEG
		We're getting the head of the company.
		
				KIM
		I'm home.
		
				PEG
		Hi, honey. We're in here.
		
				KIM
		Hi! What did you do to your hair?
		
				PEG
		Edward cut it. Isn't it wild? 
			(on telephone)
		Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you 
		in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's 
		right here. Great. So then you know all about 
		it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using. 
		Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to 
		the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a 
		little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative 
		suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much. 
		Bye bye.
			(to Edward)
		No wonder she's the head of the company. You 
		know, she started out as a sales representative 
		just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her 
		but until now I never had a reason. Thanks, 
		Edward.
		
				EDWARD
		She had some ideas?
		
				PEG
		You bet she did.
			(At the Airport)
		
				MARGIE
		I'll get that.
		
				MARGIE
		Edward! We're here. Come on. Let's get you 
		sharpened up.
		
				JIM
		You got it?
		
				KIM
		No, I can't believe this. 
			(Kim sees Edward coming.)
		Do you have a key?
		
				EDWARD
		No.
		
				KIM
		I could have sworn I put it in here somewhere.
		
				JIM
		Well, we're stranded. 
			(Edward opens the locked door with 
			his scissorhands.)
		
				KIM
		Wow! Thanks.
		
				JIM
		Ed, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break 
		it or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and 
		yell when Peg pulls in, huh?
		
				TV HOST
		Quite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward? 
		Yeah, get way over. Stand right up.
		
				WOMAN 1
		What's been the best part of your new life here 
		in town?
		
				EDWARD
		The friends I've made.
		
				TV HOST
		Any other questions?
		
				WOMAN 2
		Have you ever thought of having corrective 
		surgery or prosthetics? I know a doctor that 
		might be able to help you.
		
				EDWARD
		I'd like to meet him.
		
				TV HOST
		We'll give that name after the show. Thank you 
		very much. That's very nice. Anyone else? Yes, 
		stand right up.
		
				WOMAN 3
		But if you had regular hands you'd be like 
		everyone else.
		
				EDWARD
		Yes, I know.
		
				TV HOST
		I think he'd like that.
		
				WOMAN 4
		Then no one would think you're special. You 
		wouldn't be on TV or anything.
		
				PEG
		No matter what, Edward will always special.
		
				TV HOST
		More questions? Stand right up.
		
				WOMAN 5
		Your work is so interesting distinctive and 
		unique. Do you have plans to open your own 
		beauty salon?
		
				TV HOST
		There's an idea. Anyone else? Yeah.
		
				WOMAN 6
		Do you have a girl friend? Ahh.
			(Living room in Peg's)
		
				JIM
		Sure, he does. Right, Kim?
		
				KIM
		Now you got him started.
		
				JIM
		Knock it off, bubble- butt.
		
				KEVIN
		You did it.
		
				JIM
		So?
			(On the TV Show)
		
				TV HOST
		How about it? Is there some special lady in 
		your life?
		
				TV HOST
		Uh, everything's all right. He'll take a break 
		and we'll be right back after these messages.
		
				KIM
		Why are you laughing? He got hurt.
		
				JIM
		It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!
		
				KIM
		A little shock?
		
				JIM
		I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left 
		nut to see that again.
			(Edward in beauty salon)
		
				JOYCE
		Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so 
		thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's 
		just perfect. It's just what we've been looking 
		for. I want to call it "Shear Heaven." Here we 
		are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row 
		of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new 
		cosmetics.
			(TV 1/4)
		All along this row here.
		
				EDWARD
		Peg could sell cosmetics.
		
				JOYCE
		Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the 
		customers. Back in here is what I really want 
		to show you. This is the storeroom for 
		supplies. What I need from you today is to help 
		me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous. 
		You just sit down right there. I have some 
		smocks. Would you like me to model them? This 
		is my favorite because it's yellow. And what 
		it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that 
		fall down your neck. Then there's this old 
		purple one, you know, you kind of drape around 
		you like this.
		
				EDWARD
		I like that one.
		
				JOYCE
		You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting 
		for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward, 
		you come back here! You can't do that!
			(In the Restaurant)
		
				BILL
		Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the 
		dash board.
		
				PEG
		I've never seen that.
		
				EDWARD
		Sorry I'm late.
		
				PEG
		Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without 
		you. Here you go.
		
				BILL
		So, Edward, did you have a productive day?
		
				EDWARD
		Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going 
		to be. You could have a cosmetic counter.
		
				PEG
		Wouldn't that be great?
		
				BILL
		Great.
		
				EDWARD
		And then she showed me the back room where she 
		took all of her clothes off.
		
				BILL
		Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am.  
		I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty 
		parlor, that's what's going to teach you 
		volumes. There's nothing like running your own 
		business. I've never done it myself, but from 
		what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a 
		working man can have. So I guess the bank is 
		going to be your next step, huh?
		
				EDWARD
		The bank?
		
				BILL
		Yeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started. 
		Nothing to worry about. With your talent and 
		reputation, it's going to be a snap. Now.
		
				BANK CLERK
		No credit, no record of jobs you've held, no 
		savings, no personal investment, no social 
		security number. You may as well not even 
		exist. There is no collateral.
		
				PEG
		You know. We already have a second on the 
		house, but don't the testimonials make a 
		difference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife 
		can't wait to become a client?
		
				BANK CLERK
		We simply can't do it. Now get yourself a 
		social security card. Establish credit and buy 
		yourself a car. You have the side to advantage. 
		You can get one of those handicapped placards. 
		No problem. Park anywhere you like.
		
				PEG
		I can't believe it. Really, it's just an 
		outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of 
		it. We'll get your money somewhere.
		
				KIM
		But that's breaking and entering.
		
				JIM
		Look. My parents have insurance up the rear. 
		Okay? And all it will cost them is a little 
		hassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will 
		have new and better everything.
		
				KIM
		We can't.
		
				JIM
		Look. There's a guy who will give us cash for 
		the stuff.
		
				KIM
		Jim, I don't want to.
		
				JIM
		Well, do you want to ride around in a van like 
		Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever 
		we like? With a mattress in the back?
		
				KIM
		Why can't you just do it?
		
				JIM
		Because my father keeps the damn room locked, 
		and we need Edward to get us in.
		
				KIM
		Why can't you take the key like when he's 
		sleeping or something?
		
				JIM
		Look, you don't understand, everything he 
		handcuffs or ties will do anything for you.
		
				KIM
		What do you mean?  That's not true.
		
				JIM
		Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
		
				KIM
		That's not fair.
		
				JIM
		What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any 
		other way.
		
				KIM
		There got to be.
		
				JIM
		Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us 
		to have our own van?
		
				KIM
		Yeah.  Jim, the lights are on.
		
				JIM
		Those go on automatically. They've gone for the 
		weekend. I told you. That's right.
		
				DENNY
		This burglar scared.
		
				KIM
		You turned off the alarm. Am I right?
		
				JIM
		Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on.
		
				KIM
		I can't believe this is happening.
		
				A GIRL
		Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's 
		house?
		
				KIM
		He's never been here.
		
				EDWARD
		This person stole from you?
		
				JIM
		Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it. 
		Right? Come on. Let's go.
		
				EDWARD
		His parents will make him give it back.
		
				JIM
		Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's 
		parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim 
		you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come 
		on. Come on. Come on.
			(Edward picks the lock and the 
			door opens, but when he steps into 
			the room the alarm works and the 
			door shuts.)
		
				JIM
		The bastard had it wired separately. Come on.
		
				KIM
		No, Jim. We can't just leave him here.
		
				POLICEMAN
		We know you're in there.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		We're in the process of deactivating the system 
		so that you can come out.
		
				KIM
		Denny, turn around!
		
				JIM
		No way!
		
				KIM
		Jim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for 
		setting off your own alarm. We'll just tell 
		them we were breaking in.
		
				JIM
		I'm not going back there. Okay?
		
				KIM
		We have to go back.
		
				JIM
		No, because my father will prosecute.
		
				KIM
		His own son?
		
				JIM
		Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll 
		kill him.
		
				KIM
		Denny, turn around.
		
				JIM
		No.
		
				KIM
		Turn around. We have to.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Put your hands high in the air so we can see 
		them. Put your hands up!
		
				POLICEMAN
			(to Allen)
		He's got something in his hands. Looks like 
		knives.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon. 
		I'll ask you one more time and this is your 
		last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to 
		do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us 
		do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them. 
		Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to 
		fire. 
			(Neighbors gather and ask not to 
			fire.)
		
				A WOMAN
		Please. We know him.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Alright, cuff him.
			(At police station)
		
				PEG
		But can we see him now?
		
				POLICEMAN
		We'll have to hold him overnight for 
		observation.
		
				PEG
		He has to stay in prison all night?
		
				POLICEMAN
		Pick him up in the morning.
			(criminal investigation section in 
			police station)
		
				PEG
		Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself.
		
				BILL
			(to Edward)
		What in god's name was going through your mind, 
		son?
		
				PEG
		Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I 
		envied Jim's parents, their money.
		
				BILL
		What were you going to do with that stuff?
		
				PEG
		Oh, I blithely say, "We'll get money for the 
		salon somehow." But I never meant stealing. 
		Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's 
		not the way to get anything.
		
				BILL
		Except trouble. And you're in a heap of that.
		
				PEG
		Why ever did you do this?
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Will he be okay, Doc?
		
				PSYCHOLOGIST
		The years in spent isolation have not equipped 
		him with the tools necessary to judge right 
		from wrong. He's had no context. He's been 
		completely without guidance. Furthermore his 
		work, the garden sculptures, hair styles, and 
		so forth. Indicate that he's a highly 
		imaginative.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		Character.
		
				PSYCHOLOGIST
		It seems clear that his awareness of what we 
		call reality is radically underdeveloped.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
		But will he be all right out there?
		
				PSYCHOLOGIST
		Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.
		
				OFFICER ALLEN
			(to Edward)
		Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying 
		about you. Watch yourself.
			(roadside)
		
				MARGIE
		I heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe.
		
				JOYCE
		All along I felt in my gut. There was something 
		wrong with him.
		
				MARGIE
		It could have been my house.
		
				HELEN
		It could have been any of our houses.
		
				ESMERALDA
		I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of satan 
		on him.  You didn't heed my warning. but now 
		you will because now you see it too.
			(Reporters approach Edward and 
			Peg.)
		
				PEG
		Edward. You stay here.
		
				REPORTER
		What do you say in your defense?
		
				EDWARD
		Nothing.
		
				PEG
		He didn't want to talk.
		
				REPORTER
		You have to say something.
		
				PEG
		He can't talk right now.
		
				REPORTER
		No comments? No remarks?
		
				REPORTER
			(to Edward)
		So were you set up? What was going through your 
		mind? One comment.
		
				PEG
		We have to get in the house. We don't want to 
		talk to you. We'll talk to you later.
		
				REPORTER
		One comment.
		
				PEG
		Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at 
		our Christmas party. Before I get you here for 
		your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this 
		year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well, 
		you may think that, but you're wrong.
		
				KIM
		You're here. They didn't hurt you, did they? 
		Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back, 
		but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you 
		for not telling them about me.
		
				EDWARD
		You are welcome.
		
				KIM
		It must have been awful when they told you 
		whose house it was.
		
				EDWARD
		I know it was Jim's house.
		
				KIM
		You did?
		
				EDWARD
		Yes.
		
				KIM
		Well, then why did you do it?
		
				EDWARD
		Because you asked me to.
			(Jim called out for Kim.)
		
				KIM
		Don't.
		
				JIM
		What's the matter with you? When you are going 
		to stop? I did what I could. My old man think 
		he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail. 
		What more do you want from me?
		
				KIM
		You could tell the truth.
		
				JIM
		So could do. You were there, too.
		
				KIM
		It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do 
		it.
		
				JIM
		But you did do it. I don't get why you give 
		such a shit anyway.
		
				BILL
		Well, we are going to try to help you find a 
		way to replace the drapes and the towels, but 
		our confidence in you, Edward, is not going to 
		be so easy to replace.
		
				KIM
		Dad!
		
				BILL
		Okay, a little ethics. You are walking down the 
		street. You find a suitcase full of money. 
		There's nobody around. No human person is in 
		evidence. What do you do? A
		You keep the money. B
		You use it to buy gifts for your friends and 
		your loved ones. C
		You give it to the poor. D
		You turn it into the police.
		
				KIM
		That is really stupid.
		
				PEG
		Kim!
		
				KEVIN
		I keep the money.
		
				PEG
		Simmer down.
		
				BILL
		Edward?
		
				KIM
		Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the 
		bowling alley? That will be fun.
		
				PEG
		You are not seeing Jim tonight?
		
				KIM
		No.
		
				KEVIN
		You know we had a cool show-and-tell today. 
		This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10. 
		maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all.
		
				PEG
		Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think 
		your father's finished yet.
		
				BILL
		Thank you, dear. Edward, we are waiting.
		
				EDWARD
		Give it to my loved ones?
		
				PEG
		Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you 
		should do, bit it's not.
		
				KEVIN
		You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give 
		it to the police.
		
				BILL
		Good thinking, Kevin.
		
				KIM
		Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's 
		the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.
		
				BILL
		We're trying to make things easier for him, so 
		let's cut the comedy for a little while.
		
				KIM
		I am being serious. It's a nicer thing to do.
		
				BILL
		We're not talking nice. We're talking right and 
		wrong.
		
				KIM
		Shut up.
		
				PEG
		Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't 
		learn right from wrong living in his family.
			(Margie and women on the phone.)
		
				WOMAN 1
		Did you hear what he did to Peg's curtains?
		
				MARGIE
		It is unbelievable that they're having their 
		Christmas party anyway. Are you going?
		
				WOMAN 1
		Oh, I don't think so.
		
				MARGIE
		He practically raped Joyce, you know 
		threatening her with those knives? It's a 
		miracle she escaped.
		
				HELEN
		I don't have anything against Bill and Peg, 
		but...
		
				JOYCE
		I know, I know. They've got that teenage 
		daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things 
		after what happened to me can you imagine?
		
				HELEN
		What do you say to Peg about the Christmas 
		party?
		
				MARGIE
		I said I hoped. We'd make it.
		
				HELEN
		I lied, too.
			(Peg's living room)
		
				PEG
		Edward, do you want to give me that new 
		haircut?
		
				EDWARD
		Again?
		
				PEG
		yes, sure.
		
				PEG
		It makes me proud to have you as my own 
		personal hairdresser.
		
				KEVIN
		Hi, honey. honey.
		
				EDWARD
		Kevin, you want to play scissors-paper-stone?
		
				KEVIN
		No.
		
				EDWARD
		No, why?
		
				KEVIN
		It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.
		
				PEG
		Other people's feelings?
		
				KEVIN
		I'll be outside.
		
				PEG
		A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you 
		cut away. Cut away. It needs something else. 
		What do you think, honey?
		
				KIM
		More bells?
		
				PEG
		More bells. Okay.
		
				KIM
		Mom, do you really think that we should be 
		having this party?
		
				PEG
		Of course I think we should be having this 
		party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we 
		need is just to calm things down and then 
		everything will just go back to normal. Do you 
		have any more bells, honey?
			(Kim goes out into the garden and 
			sees Edward sculpture an ice mass. 
			When he sculptures it, snowflakes 
			begin to fall, and Kim dances in 
			the snow. After he finishes it, he 
			cuts her hand by accident. Then Jim 
			shows up.)
		
				JIM
		Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out! Go. 
		Freak!
		
				BILL
		Edward, where are you going?
		
				KIM
		Where is he?
		
				JIM
		He tried to hurt you.
		
				KIM
		No, he did not and you know it.
		
				JIM
		Are you nuts? I just saw him.
		
				KIM
		Jim. I don't love you any more. I just want you 
		to go. Okay? Just go!
		
				JIM
		Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that? 
		He isn't even human.
		
				KIM
		Just get out of here. Okay? Just go! Dad, did 
		you see where Edward went?
		
				BILL
		Well. I don't know. He just walked down the 
		street.
		
				KIM
		Well, we have to go find him, mom?
		
				PEG
		You...your father will find him this minute.
		
				BILL
		All in the house. I'll take care of it. I'll go 
		find him.
		
				HELEN
		Edward! I'm calling the police!
		
				PEG
		All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little 
		cut.
			(doorbell chimes.)
		
				POLICE
		Hello, I'm here to see the man with the hands.
		
				PEG
		Oh... Uh...
		
				POLICE
		He's not here. Thank you.
		
				PEG
		Oh, dear.
		
				MARGIE
		Helen, did you actually see him?
		
				HELEN
		Yes, look.
		
				ESMERALDA
		You see, I told you he was a demon.
		
				MARGIE
		Oh, don't start that stuff again.
		
				POLICE
		I'm looking for the man with scissors.
		
				WOMEN
		He went that way. You have to do something 
		about that.
		
				POLICE
		All right, calm down, go on home. We'll handle. 
		Just go home.
		
				HELEN
		He's a de... a demon.
		
				WOMEN
		You've got to do something! All right, Let's 
		see. If he's at our house come on, oh...
		
				PEG
		I'm sure your father will find him soon.
		
				KIM
		What time is it?
		
				PEG
		It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?
		
				KIM
		Where are they? God. I hope he's okay!
		
				PEG
		So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward 
		down here to live with us, I really didn't 
		think things through. And I didn't think about 
		what could happen to him, or to us, or to the 
		neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it 
		might be best if he goes back up there. Because 
		at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back 
		to normal.
		
				BILL
		Now I got up by the Wiggmans, but I didn't see 
		him anywhere.
		
				PEG
		Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the 
		car and go look for him.
		
				BILL
		Where's Kevin now?
		
				PEG
		He's Max'es.
		
				BILL
		Where do you think you're going, young lady?
		
				KIM
		With you guys.
		
				BILL
		No, you're staying here in case somebody shows 
		up!
		
				PEG
		We'll be right back, dear.
		
				EDWARD
		Police!
			(On seeing a police car Edward 
			goes back to Peg's)
		
				KIM
		Edward?
		
				EDWARD
		Are you okay?
		
				KIM
		Yes, are you okay?
		
				EDWARD
		Where's everybody?
		
				KIM
		Out looking for you. Hold me.
		
				EDWARD
		I can't.
			(Kim holds Edward and Edward 
			reflects about the inventor.)
		
				INVENTOR
		I know it's a little early for Christmas, 
		Edward, but I have a present for you.
			(Kevin comes out of his friend's 
			house.)
			(Jim talks with his friend.)
		
				JIM
		Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he 
		could do other places.
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Yeah, that's sick. I feel like I'm coming to 
		pass out, or puke or something.
		
				JIM
		Later, first take me to her house.
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Come on, don't make me drive.
		
				JIM
		Just do it!
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Jesus, maybe she was right about you.
		
				JIM
		Just drive.
		
				JIM'S FRIEND
		Relax.
		
				KEVIN
		See you tomorrow. Call me, Right?
		
				A MAN
		Have they caught him yet?
		
				KEVIN
		Who?
		
				A MAN
		Him, that cripple. Let me know when they do. 
		Let us all you know, okay? Like a good boy.
			(The car driven by Denny comes 
			close to run over Kevin. Edward who 
			sees it saves Kevin but many people 
			mistakenly think that Edward tries 
			to kill Kevin. Kim tells Edward to 
			run, and he runs away. People 
			follow him to the castle.)
		
				EDWARD
		Oh! Are you ok? oh! owh!
		
				KEVIN
		Help! Edward help!
		
				EDWARD
		I'm your friend.
		
				KEVIN
		Stop! Don't! Stop! Get away, now! Somebody help 
		us! Help!
		
				PEOPLE 1
		What are you doing? Get away! 
		
				PEOPLE 2
		Get the police!
		
				PEOPLE 3
		Somebody call the police! Hey
		
				KIM
		Let go of me! Why? Kevin!
		
				PEG AND BILL
		Kevin! Kevin! Edward! Get away. What happened? 
		Edward! Go home! Go home!
		
				PEOPLE
		Somebody call the police! Aah! 
		
				KIM
		Jim, stop it. Get off him!
			(Siren)
		
				KIM
		Run.
		
				PEG
		Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest 
		scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all 
		right? Let just leave him alone!
			(Gunshots)
		
				POLICE
		Go on, run.
		
				PEOPLE
		What happened? Did you get him? Ok, Is he dead?
		
				POLICE
		It's all over, go on home. There's nothing more 
		to see. What happened out there? It's all over!
		
				PEOPLE
		I want some answers. Where is he?
		
				PEOPLE
		Get back here! I want to ask you something. Do 
		you see him? Wait! I want to ask you... He's in 
		that car. Look at that.
		
				JOYCE
		I don't believe it. They don't have him. I'm 
		going! No! That's not a good idea!
		
				EDWARD
		They are coming? Did I hurt Kevin?
		
				KIM
		No, he's okay. He said he was just scared. 
		Edward, I was so afraid. I thought you were 
		dead.
		
				JIM
		I didn't.
			(Jim fires at Edward and Kim tries 
			to stop him. In their fight, Edward 
			kills Jim, and then says good-by to 
			Kim.)
		
				KIM
		Jim. Stop! Stop it, or I'll kill you myself.
		
				JIM
		Hey! I said stay away from her!
			(Neighbor's voice)
		
				EDWARD
		Goodbye!
		
				KIM
		I love you.
		
				A MAN
		Is he in there?
		
				KIM
		He's dead. The roof caved in on him. They 
		killed each other. You can see for yourselves. 
			(She raises a pair of scissors.)
		
				OLD KIM
		She never saw him again. Not after that night.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		How do you know?
		
				OLD KIM
		Because I was there.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		You could have gone up there. You still could 
		go.
		
				OLD KIM
		No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would 
		rather want him remember me the way as I was.
		
				GRANDDAUGHTER
		How do you know he's still alive.
		
				OLD KIM
		I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he 
		is. You see, before he came down here, it never 
		snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up 
		there now, I don't think it would be snowing. 
		Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.

1	EXT.    LATE 1942.    THE SAHARA DESERT.    DAY.

SILENCE.  THE DESERT seen from the air.  An ocean of dunes  for mile 
after mile.  The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to 
black.

An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the 
contours of sand.

A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem, 
szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one.

INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be 
asleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE 
PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too, 
but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's 
plaintive voice.

The plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN 
AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks 
and armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses.  
The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An 
ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously.

Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches 
violently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the 
instruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not 
conscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays 
them both, then EXPLODES.

THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both 
ON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He 
looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries 
them slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no 
sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his 
face, his lover...


2	EXT.    THE DESERT.    1942.    DAY.

THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN.  Behind them the 
wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it.  A 
SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.  Another man comes 
across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot.  The 
Pilot is charred.  His helmet has melted into his head.  He's oblivious 
to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  He twists 
frantically to find her.  Two men pick him up and carry him across to a 
litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.


3	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

The Pilot is being carried across the desert.  A mask covers his face.  
His view of the world is through the slats of reed.  He glimpses 
camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.


4	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    DUSK.

The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack 
and begin to chew it.  Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the 
Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth.  
He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth.  
Mouth to mouth.


4a*.	EXT.    DESERT.    DAWN.

THE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT, silhouetted against the dunes.


5	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    NIGHT.

The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes.  A music of glass.

AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT.  It floats in 
darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to 
reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF 
SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could 
be an angel.

The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in 
the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR 
stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep 
into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the 
support of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's 
tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets 
about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's 
flesh.

The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and 
MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, 
hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl 
he'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned 
skin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and 
BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us 
humming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle.


6*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    EARLY 1945.    DAY.

The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church 
bells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some 
supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road.  The war in Italy is 
largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and 
supply lines slowly following.


7*.	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    DAY.

A young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients.  Hana 
pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her.  
This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  A web of scars 
covers the Patient's face and body.  They have the quality of a livid 
tattoo, magenta and green-black.  The hair has largely gone and the 
effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes 
liquid.  It's a warrior's face.  But he has no physical strength.  He 
coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.


8*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.

A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck 
containing Hana and the Patient.  The horn blows and Hana looks out to 
see it contains her best friend, JAN.  TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front, 
one driving, both grinning.  Jan signals for Hana's attention.

			JAN
		There's meant to be lace in the next
		village - the boys are taking me.

			HANA
		I'm not sewing anything else.

			JAN
				(mischievously)
		You don't have any money, do you?  
		Just in case there's silk.

			HANA
		No!

			JAN
		Hana, I know you do!

Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS.  The two hands - 
hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side 
by side.  They laugh at the effort.  Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the 
sun and glints.

			HANA
		I'm not sewing anything else for you!

			JAN
				(getting the money)
		I love you.

The Jeep accelerates away.  Hana sighs to the patient.

Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE.  
The jeep is THROWN into the air.  The convoy halts and there's chaos as 
soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles.  Hana runs the 
other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by 
a soldier.


9*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    LATER.

-- and there's still chaos as two SAPPERS arrive on motorcycles.  One 
of them, a SIKH, wears a turban.

The motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy.  A nurse, MARY, is 
helping a doctor, OLIVER, attend to the injured driver.  The other two 
bodies are covered with blankets.  There's blood everywhere.  The Sikh 
and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal 
equipment.


10	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.

KIP, the Sikh Lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the road 
ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL DETECTORS and 
HEADSETS.  Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch 
along the debris-strewn road.  He stiffens as he registers metal.  With 
a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  Something 
GLEAMS.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA 
HURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road.  It's so surreal that 
neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.

			KIP
		Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!

			HARDY
		Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!

 Hana stops.  Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.

			HARDY
				(as he approaches)
		Good, that's good, just stay still for me
		and then we're going to be fine.

He arrives at Hana.  Then grabs her.  He'd like to slap her face.

			HARDY
		What are you doing?!  What the bloody 
		hell do you think you're doing?

By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.  Jan's 
BRACELET lies in the mud.  Hardy bends down and collects the mangled 
bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.


11	EXT.    VILLAGE.    DUSK.

The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the souvenirs 
of war.  An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children, 
dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road.  From the end of 
one of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN CORPSES, strung upside 
down with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration 
with the Nazis.


12	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    CONTINUOUS.

Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient 
swaying alongside her.  She puts out her hand to steady him.


13*.	EXT.    CONVOY SITE, ITALY.    DUSK.

THE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP.  The trucks are silhouetted in a line.  
Hana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground.  She bends to 
him.

			HANA
		Do you need something?

The Patient nods.  Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a 
small kit.  Mary arrives.  Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief 
for Jan's death.

			MARY
		Are you okay?  Oh God, Hana, you were
		like sisters.

			HANA
				(sighs angrily)
		We keep moving him - in and out of the
		truck.  Why?  He's dying.  What's the point?

			MARY
		Well, we can't hardly leave him.  Do
		you mean leave him?  We can't.

Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher.  She draws 
herself up against the night.  On the hill above, she can see the 
outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight.  She's crying, her face 
a frozen mask.

			HANA
		I must be a curse.  Anybody who loves me,
		anybody who gets close to me -
		or I must be cursed.  Which is it?

The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.


14	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST. ANNA, wandering through its 
overgrown gardens, past a pond.  What sanctuary it seems to offer.


15*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls have 
collapsed from shelling.  The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the 
shelves.  Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a PIANO tiled up on 
one side.  Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which 
covers it.  Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation.


15a*.	INT.    MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.

Past the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.


15b*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY STAIRS.    DAY.

Hana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads two 
thirds of the way up.


15c*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

She comes across a small CHAPEL, with the remains of murals and an 
altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table.  Hana finds an 
old bed, and a mattress.


16	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

Hana comes out, passes a DRY WATER TROUGH.  She hears a rustling on the 
gravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling towards the trough.  On cue 
there's A GURGLING SOUND.  THE HANDLELESS PUMP IS SUDDENLY GUSHING, 
splashing water everywhere.  The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this, 
enjoys a welcome shower.  Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into 
the water.  Looks around her, and makes a decision.


17	EXT.    CONVOY SITE.    ITALY.    DAY.

The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up.  Oliver passes the 
vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some 
sacks of rice.

			HANA
		The war's over - you told me yourself.
		How can it be desertion?

			OLIVER
		It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean
		literally.

			HANA
		When he dies I'll catch up.

Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, 
then lays another blanket over the Patient.

			OLIVER
		It's not safe here.  The whole country's
		crawling with Bandits and Germans and God
		knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it.
		You're not, this is natural - it's shock.  
		For all of us.  Hana -

			HANA
		I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.

			OLIVER
				(clutching at straws)
		And what if he really is a spy?

			HANA
				(impatiently)
		He can't even move.

			OLIVER
		If anything happened to you I'd never
		forgive myself.

Hana nods.  A tiny smile.  Oliver shrugs helplessly.

			OLIVER
		We're heading for Leghorn.  Livorno the
		Italians call it.  We'll expect you.


18*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the 
monastery.  Hana indicates the stairs.

			HANA
		Up there.

They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly 
avoids falling into the void in the stairs.  The cot almost tips up, at 
which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but 
still clearly aristocratic.

			THE PATIENT
		There was a Prince, who was dying, and
		he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he
		could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills.
		Am I that Prince?

Hana laughs.

			HANA
		Because you're leaning?  No, you're 
		just on an angle.  You're too heavy!

Mary laughs.  They reach the landing.  Hana kicks open the door to the 
CHAPEL.

			HANA
		In here.


18a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away 
the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust.  They lower the Patient onto 
the bed.  She turns to the SOLDIERS.

			HANA
		Thank you.

She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room, 
its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos.  Hana smiles, opens a shutter 
to let a fierce envelope of light into the room.

			HANA
		Good.

	She goes to Mary and hugs her.


19*.	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

A smaller upstairs room completely bare.  As Hana tugs off her uniform, 
she looks out of the window to see the departing Convoy.  A cotton 
dress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger 
and rather fragile.   THROUGH THE DAMAGED FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A 
VIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER.  SHE LOOKS AT HIM.  NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS 
AND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR, NOT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT IN A GESTURE OF A 
NEW BEGINNING.


19a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA walks down to the Patient's Room and stands in the doorway.  The 
Patient turns his head to her.  He's grinning.  He puts up a thumb.  On 
the track a song begins:  Some Other Time.


20*.	EXT.  BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.  1938.  LATE DAY.

THE SONG CONTINUED IN THE DESERT where we find the singer - PETER 
MADOX, a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an BATTERED 
TIGER MOTH AEROPLANE.  His face is blackened with oil.  A second 
European, ALMÁSY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the 
camshaft.  Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for 
Almasy to inspect.  Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging 
in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides 
and servants to the Almásy/Madox Expedition.  It's 1938 and the whole 
continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other, 
pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities.

D'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane 
in one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS.  He gets out 
carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR.  He looks very pleased with 
himself as he shows the jar to Almásy and then passes it to Madox.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Thirsty?

			MADOX
				(sniffing inside)
		What's this?

			D'AGOSTINO
		Don't drink it!

He reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a 
brackish and stinks.  Madox makes a face.

			D'AGOSTINO
		I can't guarantee the vintage, my 
		friends.  I just dug it out of the hill.

Madox and Almásy have seen many such jugs.

			MADOX
		Excellent.  That's terrific, D'Ag.
				(to Almásy, of a tool)
		Toss that up, would you.

			D'AGOSTINO
				(mischievously)
		There are some others.


21	EXT.    POTTERY HILL.    DAY.

THE BASE OF A HILL SEEMS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF POTTERY JARS.

D'Agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading Madox and Almásy.  
The other members of the team are already there - BERMANN, a German 
PHOTOGRAPHER and FOUAD, EGYPTOLOGIST from Cairo.

			MADOX
				(to Almásy, astonished)
		My God, look at this!

They bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, 
piled on top of each other.  Bermann approaches them, carrying his 
tripod.

			BERMANN
		Incredible, Hmm?  Quite incredible.

			D'AGOSTINO
		I've never seen anything like it.  There 
		would have been enough water here to
		serve an army.

			ALMÁSY
				(gloomily)
		Which means we're in the wrong place.

Almásy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Why?

			ALMÁSY
		Would you stockpile water near to an
		Oasis?  There can't be a natural spring
		within fifty miles of here.

			FOUAD
		Or they didn't know of one.

			BERMANN
		So, it may not be Zerzura, still
		incredible.

			D'AGOSTINO
				(nodding, delighted)
		A pottery hill!

			ALMÁSY
		A wild goose chase.

			MADOX
				(firmly)
		No.

Almásy gives him a look.  But Madox will have none of it.

			MADOX
		No.  Now we look in the other places.
		We're eliminating.

The unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE distracts them.

			MADOX
		Good, and here comes reinforcements.


21a*.	EXT.    BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DAY.

LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on 
the flat desert.  The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals.  
Almásy is not with them.  He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.

A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane.  They 
are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON.

And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane-
crash at the beginning of the film.

Madox makes all the introductions.  Hands are shaken, hellos all round, 
as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear.  Geoffrey removes 
his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, 
produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.

			CLIFTON
		I hereby Christen us the International
		Sand Club!


22	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    LATE DAY.

The party is in the shade of the tents.  Almásy joins the group.  Madox 
nods over to the Clifton plane.

			MADOX
		Marvelous plane.  Did you look?

			CLIFTON
				(beaming at Almásy)
		Isn't it?  Wedding present from
		Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it
		Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

			MADOX
		We can finally consign my old bird
		to the scrapheap.

	Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.

			KATHARINE
				(smiling, offering her hand)
		Geoffrey gave me your monograph when
		I was reading up on the desert.
		Very impressive.

			ALMÁSY
				(stiff)
		Thank you.

			KATHARINE
		I wanted to meet a man who could write
		such a long paper with so few adjectives.

			ALMÁSY
		A thing is still a thing no matter what
		you place in front of it.  Big car, slow
		car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.

			CLIFTON
				(joining them and joining in)
		A broken car?

			ALMÁSY
		Still a car.

			CLIFFTON
				(hands them champagne)
		Not much use, though.

			KATHARINE
		Love?  Romantic love, platonic love,
		filial love - ?  Quite different things,
		surely?

			CLIFTON 
				(hugging Katharine)
		Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind
		of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.

			ALMÁSY
				(a dry smile)
		There you have me.


23	INT.  THE PATIENT'S ROOM.  THE MONASTERY.  MORNING.

The morning floods into the room.  The Patient lies, lost in the 
desert.  Then a sudden CLATTERING NOISE disturbs him.


24	INT.   STAIRS, THE MONASTERY.   DAY.

Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged 
stairs, and with others, she is improvising new steps.  The heavy 
volumes are perfect for treading on.


25	INT.   LIBRARY.   DAY.

Hana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out 
to continue her stair repairs.


26*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana enters.

			THE PATIENT
		What was all the banging?  Were you
		fighting rats or the entire German army?

			HANA
		I was repairing the stairs.  I found a
		library and the books were very useful.

Hana shrugs.  She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping 
up the pillows.  He's short of breath.

			THE PATIENT
		Before you find too many uses for these
		books would you read some to me?

			HANA
		I think they're all in Italian, but I'll
		look, yes.  What about your own book?

			THE PATIENT
				(reluctant)
		My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we
		can read him.

Hana picks up the book and hands it to him.  Then she starts rummaging 
in her pockets.

			HANA
		Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums
		in the orchard.  We have an orchard!

She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.

			THE PATIENT
		Thank you.

His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping 
from the mouth.  Hana mops it up.

			THE PATIENT
		The plumness of this plum.

A noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.

			THE PATIENT
		What's that?


27	INT/EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling 
increases.  She's in time to catch the TORTOISE arriving once again in 
the WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush with water.  She shouts up 
to The Patient's open window.

			HANA
		Water!
				(bends to the Tortois)
		You hear it, too, don't you!


28	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Close on the HERODOTUS.  The Patient opens its cover, held together by 
leather ties.  Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES 
are all collected between the pages.  He claws at some water-colors 
which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned 
warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with 
plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like 
those of Matisse.  Some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  Then 
the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to 
the floor with a crack.


29	INT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

A SHOT RINGS OUT, disturbing the evening meal.  Almásy and others go 
outside.  Silhouetted on a ridge, a group of men sit astride camels.  
One of them holds his rifle aloft, clearly pointing towards the sky - 
means friend.  Fouad peers at the horizon.

			FOUAD
		European, I think, with guides.

			CLIFTON
				(can only see shapes)
		How do you know?

			MADOX
				(frowns)
		Yes, and I think I know who this is.


30	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

ALMÁSY AND MADOX WALK OUT TO INTERCEPT THE ARRIVALS as the first Arab 
dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse.  
Almásy speaks in Arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings.

DURING THIS, FENELON-BARNES, sole European in this expedition, has 
finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping 
the animal in disgust.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Ugly brute.  Shits and roars and
		complains all day.
				(bypassing Almásy and
approaching Madox)
		Of course, you have your aeroplane.  
		Two now!  Do you still call yourselves
		explorers?  I assume not.

			MADOX
				(stiffly)
		Fenelon-Barnes.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an
		explorer, can't he?  Or should Columbus
		have swum to America?


31	INT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

The arrivals come inside.  Madox handles the introductions.

			MADOX
		I think you know all of us, except for
		Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've
		recently come out from England.

			CLIFTON
		Apprentices.

			MADOX
		This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.

			FENELON-BARNES
				(to Katharine)
		I know your mother, of course.

			KATHARINE
		Hello.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'm also searching for the lost Oasis, 
		but by more authentic means.

			MADOX
				(of Almásy)
		Anyway, my friend here has a new theory -
		that Zerzura doesn't exist.  So we may all
		be chasing windmills.  Have some food.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Well, it's certainly not between here and
		Dakhla.  Nine days of nothing but sand
		and sandstorms.  An egg.  I found an
		ostrich egg and some fossils.

			KATHARINE
		Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by
		spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?

			ALMÁSY
		What kind of fossils?

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'll invite you to my paper at the
		Royal Geographical Society.
		Are you still a member?

He takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing camel milk.

			ALMÁSY
		I think you know I am.

			FENELON-BARNES
				(ignoring Almásy)
		Quite impossible, Madox.  You must know 
		that.  If you attempt to cross the Sand
		Sea due east of Kufra by car you'll leave
		your bones in the sand for me to collect.

			ALMÁSY
				(leaving the tent)
		If you come across my bones - I hope
		you'll do me the honor of leaving 
		them in peace.
				(to Katharine)
		Excuse me.

			FENELON-BARNES
		You have my word as a gentleman.
				(watching him leave)
		I've discovered a unique type of
		sand-dune.  I've applied to the King
		for permission to call it 
		The Fenelon-Barnes Formation.


32	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.

	LATER, supper over, the company is entertaining itself.

Almásy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a 
distance.

D'Ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of  Puccini's E 
Lucevan Le Stelle.  He sits down to much applause from the others and 
SPINS AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE on the sand.  It comes to rest pointing 
at Clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into Yes! We Have No 
Bananas with great gusto.  His version involves CHANGING LANGUAGE 
during each line of the chorus - prompted by Oui!  or Ja!  or Si!  from 
the others.  Song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle 
and it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-Barnes and Katharine - until 
with a little NUDGE from the husband it settles on his wife.  Katharine 
gets up, awkward.

			KATHARINE
		I can't sing.
				(the audience groans)
		but I can tell a story.
				(to Almásy, who has arrived)
		I might need a prompt.  Do you have your
		Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it...

			ALMÁSY
		I'm sorry - what have you noticed?

			MADOX
		Your book.  Your Herodotus!

Almásy looks uncomfortable.

			KATHARINE
				(reacting quickly)
		It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can
		muddle through.  Okay - The Story of 
		Candaules and Gyges.  King Candaules was
		passionately in love with his wife -
				(Geoffrey whistles proudly)
		One day he said to Gyges, the son of
		somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -

			ALMÁSY
				(quietly prompting her)
		Daskylus...

			KATHARINE
				(smiles)
		Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus -
		Candaules said to him I don't think you
		believe me when I tell you how beautiful
		my wife is.  And although Gyges replied he
		did find the Queen magnificent the King 
		insisted he would find some way to prove
		beyond dispute that she was fairest of
		all women.  Do you all know this story?

The men all encourage her to continue her story.


33*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

- and Hana's voice CONTINUES THE STORY as she reads to the Patient who 
listens, eyes closed, still in the desert.

			HANA
				(reading from the Herodotus)
		I will hide you in the room where 
		we sleep, said Candaules.

She stumbles over the word.

			THE PATIENT
		Candaules

			HANA
				(not neurotic)
		Candaules...you're laughing at me.

			THE PATIENT
		I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.

			HANA
		When my wife comes to lie down she always
		lays her garments one by one on a seat
		near the entrance of the room, and from
		where you stand you will be able to gaze
		on her at your leisure...


34*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.

			KATHARINE
				(her story continuing)
		And that evening, it's exactly as the
		King had told him, she goes to the chair
		and removes her clothes, one by one, 
		until she stand naked in full view of
		Gyges.  And indeed she was more lovely
		than he could have imagined.

Almásy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky.  Katharine turns 
to looks at him.

			KATHARINE
		But then the Queen looked up and saw
		Gyges concealed in the shadows.   And
		though she said nothing, she shuddered.
		The next day she sent for Gyges and
		challenged him.  And hearing his story,
		she said this -

			CLIFTON
		Off with his head!

			KATHERINE
		#NAME?
		death for gazing on that which you
		should not, or else kill my husband who
		shamed me and become King in his place.

Clifton makes a face of outrage.  For Katherine the story has 
collapsed.  She wants it to be finished.

			KATHERINE
		So Gyges killed the King and married
		the Queen and became ruler of Lydia
		for twenty eight years.  The End.
				(an uncomfortable moment)
		Do I spin the bottle?

Almásy shrinks away from the fire, disappears into black.

			MADOX
				(to Clifton)
		And let that be a lesson to you!


35	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana looks up from the Herodotus, sees the Patient's eyes closed.  
Gently touches his face and whispers.

			HANA
		Are you asleep?

			THE PATIENT
				(lying)
		Yes.  Dropping off.

And Hana closes the book, gets up, and blows out the lamp.  


36	INT.   FENELON-BARNES TENT.   POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.

PITCH BLACK and then A TORCH flickers on as Almásy enters Fenelon-
Barnes' tent.  He pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically.  
He finds what he is looking for inside a trunk:  A LARGE FOSSILIZED 
BRANCH; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin.  
Then he's distracted by a noise from Fenelon-Barnes' bed.  Almásy 
stiffens, turns to investigate.  There's A LUMP in the cot.  A dog?  
Almásy eases back the blanket to reveal a YOUNG GIRL, no more than 
fourteen, bound hand and foot.  He holds the torch to her face.


37	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    MORNING.

The next morning.  Almásy and Madox prepare to take off.  As they talk 
Clifton's Rupert Bear taxis past them, a wave from Clifton and 
Katharine.  Madox is very disturbed by what Almásy is telling him.

			MADOX
		What did you think you were
		doing in his tent?

			ALMÁSY
		Looking for the fossils.  Why should we
		wait until we're in London?  This girl 
		was probably twelve years old.

			MADOX
				(getting into the plane)
		You shouldn't go into another man's tent.
		It's inexcusable.

			ALMÁSY
		Her hands and feet were tied.

			MADOX
		What did you do?

			ALMÁSY
		I looked at them.  They're shrubs,
		small trees.  Exquisite.  And
		fossilized, rock hard.

He walks away to the nose of the plane.

			MADOX
		I was talking about the girl.

			ALMÁSY
		Cut the ropes.  I left a note,
		on his blanket.
				(gleefully)
		At the next Geographical Society I 
		shall await with great interest the
		announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes
		Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, 
		of course.  Her father had sold her
		for a camel.

He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.


38	EXT.    GILF KEBIR PLATEAU.    MORNING.

Both planes are scouting the Gilf Kebir region.  Geoffrey flies up 
alongside Madox and wiggles his wings.  Madox waves.

They're flying over a distinctive group of GRANITE MASSIFS, Crater-
shaped hills.  The broken towers of the Gilf Kebir.  Almasy is 
distracted by them.  He turns to Madox and points down, indicating they 
should explore them.

Madox gestures to the Cliftons to PHOTOGRAPH the Massifs.  A THUMBS UP 
from Geoffrey.


39*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Hana gives the Patient his injection, now she begins to change the 
sheet.  The light streams in from the open window.  She looks up at the 
green hills rolling away from the Monastery, the village in the 
distance.

			HANA
		I should try and move your bed.  I want
		you to be able to see the view.  It's
		good, it's a view from a monastery.

			THE PATIENT
		I can already see.

			HANA
				(bending down to his level)
		How?  How can you see anything?

			THE PATIENT
		Not the window - I can't bear the light
		anyway - no, I can see all the way to 
		the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.

			HANA
		I'm turning you.

An awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back.  He grunts with the 
pain.  She washes him very tenderly.

			THE PATIENT
		Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the
		Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the
		scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can
		smell it.  The taste of tea so black it
		falls into your mouth.  I can taste it.
		I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my
		eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

			HANA
		No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.

			THE PATIENT
		I can see my wife in that view.

			HANA
		Are you remembering more?

			THE PATIENT
		Could I have a cigarette?

			HANA
		Are you crazy?

			THE PATIENT
		Why are you so determined to
		keep me alive?

			HANA
		Because I'm a nurse.


40	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDENS.    NOON.

The TORTOISE heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment.  
It reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis 
shoes, a frock.  It clambers over as the water begins to belch out.  
Hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great 
YELP of shivering joy.


41*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.

It's dark, but something is going on here.  Hana is caught by the stray 
shafts of moonlight.  She is SCRATCHING something on the flagstones.  
Her skirt is bunched up around her thighs.  She throws something in the 
air.  It's a SPILE, used to tap into the maple tree for syrup.  It 
lands with a crack.  Suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a 
skip, a jump.  Then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then 
back again, in this blindman's version of HOPSCOTCH.


42*.	INT.    TRAIN.    ITALY 1944.    BEFORE DAWN.

AS HANA HOPS AND JUMPS IN THE SHADOWS SHE IS SUDDENLY ON A TRAIN IN 
1944.  A HOSPITAL TRAIN ploughs through the night carrying the wounded 
back to Naples.

Hana walks through a long carriage.  HER HAIR IS LONG.  She could be 
ten years younger than the Hana at the Monastery.  And easy.  She stops 
at the bunk of A NEW PATIENT.  Hana bends to the boy.  He's had 
shrapnel in his legs and cheek.  She speaks softly to him.

			HANA
		How are you?

			BOY
		Okay.

			HANA
		Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel
		came out - I saved you the pieces.

			BOY
		You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.

			HANNA
				(she hears this every day)
		I don't think so.

			BOY
		Would you kiss me?

			HANA
		No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till
		you're in Naples.  You'll find a
		girl there.

			BOY
				(innocent)
		Just kiss me.  It would mean
		such a lot to me.

			HANA
				(tender, believing him)
		Would it?

She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.

			BOY
		Thank you.

He closes his eyes.  Is almost instantly asleep.  Hana smiles, 
continues along the compartment.  VOICES CALL OUT.

			#1 INJURED MAN
		Nurse - I can't sleep.

			#2 INJURED MAN
		Nurse?  Would you kiss me?

			#3 INJURED MAN
		You're so pretty!

			#4 INJURED MAN
		Hinky-dinky parlez-vous!

			HANA
				(good-naturedly waving
away their joke)
		Very funny.  Go to sleep.

She gets into a corridor.  Mary is coming the other way.  She carries a 
blood-soaked bundle.  Hana questions her appalled expression.

			MARY
		Don't ask.


43	INT.    RAILWAY STATION.    DAY.

The train is arriving.  Hana hangs out of a window, scouring the crowds 
to find her sweetheart, STUART McGANN, a young Canadian Captain, who 
seeing her runs up to her window.

			HANA
		Where are we going?  I don't want to be
		kissing in a crowd.  I have six hours.

She jumps out of the moving door and into his arms.

			STUART
				(laughing at her ferocity)
		Whoa - give me a chance!

			HANA
		Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.

The Station is full of desperate people trying to make do.  the couple 
hurry through, oblivious to anyone except each other.

			STUART
		I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go
		to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.

			HANA
		I'd like to spend a night with you
		in a bed.

			STUART
		We can do that when we're very very old.


44	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana lies alone in her bed covered by a curtain.  There's a sharp 
NOISE.  She's very frightened.  She has her pistol under her pillow and 
pulls it out, listens, holding her breath.  Another BANG.  She listens.


45	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.

Hana has been reviving a vegetable patch.  She comes to garden.  CROWS 
are feasting.  She's furious, shouts, runs at them.  Nature, wildness, 
insisting on invading her peace.


46*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    GRAVEYARD.    MORNING.

Hana appears from the Cemetery, dragging A METAL CRUCIFIX.  It's bigger 
than she is, and she drags it, as if approaching Calvary.  A MAN 
WATCHER HER FROM A BICYCLE.  He's approaching fifty, grizzled and 
attractive, and could be Italian.  His hands are bandaged.  Hana aims 
the cross at the soil, but is not quite bit or strong enough.  The man, 
CARAVAGGIO, chooses this moment to introduce himself.  He drops the 
bicycle on the ground with a clatter.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(very cheerful)
		Buon' Giorno!

Hana turns, startled and suspicious.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Are you Hana?

			HANA
		What do you want?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I met your friend Mary.  She said I
		should stop and see if you were okay.
		Apparently we're neighbors - my house
		is two blocks from yours in Montreal.
		Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

			HANA
				(unraveling this information)
		Bonjour.

He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand behind her ear - PRODUCES 
AN EGG.  He beams, as does Hana.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'd like to take credit, but it's from
		Mary.  My name's David Caravaggio,
		but nobody ever called me David.
		Caravaggio they find to absurd to
		miss out on.

During this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to Hana's 
other ear.  THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND.  Cursing, he gets on his knees 
and starts to scoop it up, preserving it.


47*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    KITCHEN.    DAY.

Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl.  She beats them with 
a knife picking out the bits of shell.  Caravaggio watches, takes in 
how little food there is otherwise.  The table seems useful more as a 
sewing area than for cooking - it's STREWN WITH ALTAR CLOTHS being sewn 
into drapes.  On a tray on the table are TWO PHIALS OF MORPHINE from 
the Patient's room.  As Hana turns to the stove, he's moved and covered 
them with his bandaged hands, a second later and he's juggled them into 
his pockets with the slightest clink.  Hana looks at him.  He shrugs, 
nods at the eggs.

			CARAVAGGIO
		They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg
		in...have you noticed there are chickens?
		You get chickens in Italy but no eggs.
		In Africa there were always eggs, but
		never chickens.  Who separates them?

			HANA
		You were in Africa?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Yeah, for a while.

			HANA
		So was my Patient.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'd like to stay.  That's the long and
		short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah
		if it's convenient, if there's room 
		blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some 
		work here -I speak the language.  
		There are Partisans to be -
				(trying to paraphrase)
		#NAME?
		relieve them of their weapons, you 
		know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so 
		they think I'd be good at that.

			HANA
		So you can shoot a pistol?

			CARAVAGGIO
				(showing his hands)
		No.

			HANA
		If you said yes I would have had a
		reason.  You should let me redress
		those bandages.  Before you go.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house.  We
		needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot
		a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I
		don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.

			HANA
		Because we're fine here.  I don't know
		what Mary told you about me, but I
		don't need company, I don't need
		to be looked at.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Fine.  I'm not looking.


48	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana carries in a tray.  There's OMELETTE on the plate.

			HANA
		There's a man downstairs.  He
		brought us eggs.
				(shows him the omelette)
		He might stay.

			THE PATIENT
		Why?  Can he lay eggs?

			HANA
		He's Canadian.

			THE PATIENT
				(brittle)
		Why are people always so happy when
		they collide with someone from the same
		place?  What happened in Montreal when
		you passed a man in the street - did you
		invite him to live with you?

			HANA
		He needn't disturb you.

			THE PATIENT
		Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.

			HANA
		He won't disturb us then.  I think
		he's after morphine.
				(she's cut the omelette
into tiny pieces)
		There's a war.  Where you come from
		becomes important.  And besides - 
		we're vulnerable here.  I keep hearing
		noises in the night.  Voices.

The Patient says nothing.  She puts a spoonful of the omelette into his 
mouth.  He grunts.


49	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    STAIRS.    DAY.

	Caravaggio is in the shadows on the stairs.  HE LISTENS.


50	EXT.    CAIRO MARKET.    1938.    DAY.

A STREET MARKET in full sway, a locals-only affair, blazing with noise 
and bustle and barter.  Emerging from a thicket of women and begging 
children, KATHARINE CLIFTON carries her purchase of an exotic-looking 
RUG.  From nowhere she is joined by Almásy.

			ALMÁSY
		How much did you pay?

			KATHARINE
				(delighted)
		Hello!  Good morning.

			ALMÁSY
		They don't see foreign women in this
		market.  How much did you pay?

			KATHARINE
		Seven pounds, eight, I suppose.  Why?

			ALMÁSY
		Which stall?

			KATHARINE
		Excuse me?

			ALMÁSY
		You've been cheated, don't worry,
		we'll take it back.

			KATHARINE
				(bristling)
		I don't want to go back.

			ALMÁSY
		This is not worth eight pounds,
		Mrs. Clifton.

			KATHARINE
		I don't care to bargain.

			ALMÁSY
		That insults them.

			KATHARINE
				(turning to face him)
		I don't believe that.  I think you are
		insulted by me, somehow.  You're a
		foreigner too, aren't you, here,
		in this market?

			ALMÁSY
				(of the carpet)
		I should be very happy to obtain
		the correct price for this.  I apologize
		if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at
		social graces.
				(tart)
		How do you find Cairo?  Did you
		visit the Pyramids?

			KATHARINE
		Excuse me.

He stands as she continues, pushing past him, shrugging off the 
children, boiling.


51	INT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

THE LONG BAR.  The Exploration Team are drinking at a table.  They are 
not entirely off-duty - Almásy and Madox as ever ponder the maps.  
Geoffrey Clifton appears, arms waving.

			CLIFTON
		Gentlemen, good evening!

He sits down.   Madox hails the waiter.

			D'AGOSTINO
		How is your charming wife?

			CLIFTON
		Uh, marvelous.  She's in love with
		the hotel plumbing.  She's either in
		the swimming pool - she swims for
		hours, she's a fish, quite incredible -
		or she's in the bath.  Actually,
		she's just outside.
				(responding to their
bewildered expressions)
		Chaps Only in the Long Bar.

			MADOX
				(standing, embarrassed)
		Of course.  Well, we should all go
		out onto the terrace.

			CLIFTON
		Oh no, really.  She has her book.

			MADOX
		I won't hear of it.  None of us will.


52	EXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL TERRACE.    NIGHT.

Katharine appears with Geoffrey to join the arriving Explorers.  She 
looks exquisite in her evening clothes.  Madox brings her to her seat.  
There is dancing inside, and couples walk to and from their tables.  
Katharine manages to produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone 
except Almásy.

			MADOX
		Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive
		us.  We're not accustomed to the
		company of women.

			KATHARINE
		Not at all.  I was thoroughly 
		enjoying by book.
				(indicating they should all sit 
and then nodding at Almásy
before greeting the others)
		Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.

			CLIFTON
		The team is in mourning, darling.

			KATHARINE
		Oh really?

			MADOX
		I'm afraid we're not having much luck
		obtaining funds for the expedition.

			KATHARINE
		How awful.  What will you do?

			MADOX
		A more modest expedition, or even wait a
		year.  Remind our families we still exist.

			CLIFTON
				(astonished)
		Good heavens, are you married, Madox?

			MADOX
		Very much so.  We are all, save my
		friend here.

He nods at Almasy.  Clifton appears tremendously relieved.

			CLIFTON
		I feel much better, don't you darling?
		We were feeling rather self-conscious.
		Let's toast, then.  To absent wives.

			D'AGOSTINO
				(toasting Katharine)
		And present ones.

			KATHARINE
				(toasting Almásy)
		And future ones.


53	INT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    NIGHT.

THE BALLROOM.  A dance finishes.  Almásy takes over from D'Agostino to 
partner Katharine.  They dance beautifully.  The others remain on the 
terrace in deep conversation.

			KATHARINE
		Why did you follow me yesterday?

			ALMÁSY
		Excuse me?

			KATHARINE
		After the market, you followed me
		to the hotel.

			ALMÁSY
		I was concerned.  As I said, women in
		that part of Cairo, a European women,
		I felt obliged to.

			KATHARINE
		You felt obliged to.

			ALMÁSY
		As the wife of one of our party.

			KATHARINE
				(sardonic)
		So why follow me?  Escort me, by
		all means.  Following me is
		predatory, isn't it?

The dance finishes.  They walk back to their table, where Almásy leads 
Katharine back to her seat next to Clifton.

			CLIFTON
		I was just saying, I'm going to cable
		Downing Street, see if I can't stir up
		a few shillings - Katharine's mother
		and the PM's wife are best -

			KATHARINE
				(interrupting)
		Darling, for goodness' sake!

			CLIFTON
		Well, she is!


54*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana, having already replaced the bedlinen, is standing on a stepladder 
trying to hang home-made drapes around the bed as Caravaggio knocks 
tentatively, then comes in.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hello.

			THE PATIENT
		Finally!  So you're our
		Canadian pickpocket?

	He goes to help Hana, they work as he talks.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Thief, I think, is more accurate.

			THE PATIENT
		I understand you were in Africa.
		Whereabouts?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Oh, all over.

			THE PATIENT
		All over?  I kept trying to cover
		a very modest portion and still failed.
				(to Hana)
		Are you leaving us?  Now's our
		opportunity to swap war wounds.

			HANA
		Then I'm definitely going.

And she exits.  The men consider her.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Does she have war wounds?


55*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S ROOM.    DAY.

As Hana walks up her stairs she finds herself overhearing their 
conversation as it threads up through the hole in the ceiling.  She 
strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet.

			THE PATIENT
		I think anybody she ever loves
		tends to die on her.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Are you planning to be the exception?

			THE PATIENT
		Me?  You've got the wrong end of
		the stick, old boy.
				(a pause)
		So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you
		invented your name.

			CARAVAGGIO
		And you've forgotten yours.

			THE PATIENT
		I told her you would never invent
		such a preposterous name.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I told her you can forget everything
		but you never forget your name.


56*.	EXT.    BEACH CABIN.    ITALY.    DAY.    1944.

HANA IS STILL LISTENING BUT NOW SHE'S OUTSIDE A CABIN.  She's in her 
uniform, clearing things away.  The Cabin door is ajar.  An OFFICER 
moves around, then sits to make notes.

			OFFICER (O/S)
		What about your rank or serial number?

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found
		near the wreckage of a plane by the
		Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.

THIS CONVALESCENCE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN FASHIONED FROM A LONG ROW OF 
BATHING CABINS ON THE COAST, complete with Campari Umbrellas and metal 
tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the 
comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted conversation.  Hana 
walks up to the Patient's cabin.  He is propped up with a view of the 
sea, which is interrupted by the pacing Officer.  Hana has a blanket 
and a chart for the Patient's bed.  She busies herself.

			OFFICER
		Do you remember where you were born?

			THE PATIENT
		Am I being interrogated?  You should be
		trying to trick me.  Ask me about
		Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace.
		About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make
		me speak German, which I can, by the way.

			OFFICER
		Why?  Are you German?

			THE PATIENT
		No.  

			OFFICER
		How do you know you're not German if
		you don't remember anything?

			THE PATIENT
		You tell me.  I remember a lot of things.
		I remember a garden, plunging down to
		the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called
		it - and there was a cottage at the
		bottom, right on the shore, nothing
		between you and France.

			OFFICER
		This was your garden?

			THE PATIENT
		Or my wife's.

			OFFICER
		Then you were married?

			THE PATIENT
		I think so.  Although I believe that
		to be true of a number of Germans.
		Might I have a glass of water?

Hana pours him a glass of water.  He notices her.

			THE PATIENT
		Thank you.
				(he sips)
		Look - my lungs are useless -
				(makes a small gap with
his fingers)
		I've got this much lung...the rest
		of my organs are packing up -
		what could it possibly matter if I
		were Tutankhamun?  I'm a bit of
		toast, my friend - butter me and
		slip a poached egg on top.

Hana leaves, smiling at the Patient's irascibility, sharing this with 
the Officer, who frowns.  The interview continues.


57	EXT.    BEACH CABIN.    DAY.

Hana walks between the cabins.  STUART steps out of the shade.  He is 
drawn, older than last seen.

			STUART
		My leave is canceled.  I can't
		meet you later.

Hana frowns, helpless.  As if to emphasize this, a Staff Nurse comes 
by, carrying a bowl and a withering look.


58*.	INT.    BEACH CABIN.    DAY.

 Hana enters, approaches the Patient.  She's circumspect.

			HANA
		Excuse me -

			THE PATIENT
		Yes?

			HANA
		Can I ask - my friend, can he come in?
		Just for a few minutes?

			THE PATIENT
		Your friend?

			HANA
		He's going back to the front this
		evening.  I can't see him otherwise.

			THE PATIENT
		Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.

			HANA
		No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't 
		offended, it would be very good of you 
		to allow us - every other cabin is crammed.
		This is as private as we'll get.

			THE PATIENT
		Well then - yes.  Of course.

			HANA
		Thank you.  Thank you.

She hurries out, returns with Stuart.  They stand awkwardly.

			HANA
		This is Captain McGann.

			THE PATIENT
		Please, don't waste your time on
		pleasantries -

			STUART
		Thanks.

			THE PATIENT
		I'm going to sing.  If I sing I shan't
		hear anything.

And with that he bursts into a raucous, coughing version of Yes! We 
Have No Bananas.  He changes language each verse.  The couple stand, 
formal, then edge round to the back of the bed.

			HANA
				(touching his lip)
		You've got a mustache.

			STUART
		A bit of one.

			HANA
		I was looking forward to this evening.

			STUART
				(whispers)
		I had a hotel room.

			HANA 
				(whispers)
		I thought that was for when we
		were very very old?

			STUART
		I'm feeling old.

They EMBRACE, fiercely, hardly making a sound, or moving.  THE PATIENT 
ROARS THE SONG.


59*.	EXT.   THE MONASTERY.   HANA'S GARDEN.   MORNING.

A battered open backed TRUCK comes into the Monastery.  An ITALIAN 
PARTISAN sits in the back, a SHOTGUN resting on his knees.  The truck 
stops, and Caravaggio emerges from the passenger door.  He collects 
some packages from the PARTISAN, including a dead RABBIT, and then 
exchanges a few words with the driver.  Hana, who's watching all of 
this from her garden, sees that the driver is a WOMAN.  The woman's 
name is GIOIA, and Caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye 
to her.

Caravaggio approaches the Vegetable Garden as Hana comes to greet him.  
He throws her the rabbit, and hurries up the stairs without pausing, 
clutching the other boxes.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Supper.

Hana calls after him.

			HANA
		Where've you been?

			CARAVAGGIO
				(not stopping)
		Rabbit hunting.

Hana looks at the rabbit.  She's angry.  Caravaggio hasn't been around 
for a week.


60*.	INT.  THE MONASTERY.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  DAY.

Hana heads up for the kitchen, then stops as there's a faint CRASH from 
upstairs.


61*.	INT.   THE MONASTERY.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.   DAY.

Hana, the rabbit still in her hands, comes along the corridor to find 
Caravaggio SLUMPED on the floor, retching.  The discarded NEEDLE lies 
beside him, the new package of MORPHINE CAPSULES ripped open.  He looks 
up at Hanna, glazed.

			HANA
		I could help you.  I could
		get you off that.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Can you cook the rabbit or will you
		try and bring that back to life?

She bends, starts clearing up, putting the morphine phials back into 
the box.

			HANA
		It's a week.  We didn't know where you
		were - or if you coming back, or -

			CARAVAGGIO
				(of the drugs)
		You should be happy.  What were you
		going to do for him when it ran out?

He pulls out more phials from his jacket.

			HANA
		What do you do?  What are you doing here?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Some gave me a dress.
				(starts to tear at a parcel)
		You know what's great?  What I'm learning?
		You win a war and you not only gain the
		miles you get the moral ground.
		Everywhere I go, we're in the right.
		I like that.


62*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana comes in, carrying a batch of the new morphine.  She's wearing a 
different FROCK.  It's not new, and it's faded, but the change of color 
is startling.

			THE PATIENT
		Something smells so rich.  My
		stomach is heaving -

			HANA
		He came back, he says he caught a
		rabbit.  I'm cooking it.

			THE PATIENT
		That's a different dress.

			HANA
		He keeps asking me questions about you.
		Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?

			THE PATIENT
		Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is.
		I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read
		Italian.  He can catch rabbits.


63*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

Almásy squats with an ANCIENT ARAB outside his rudimentary house, while 
he draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a 
possible location for the lost oasis.  The man stops speaking and 
scours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint noise 
of a PLANE.  It's Clifton's Steerman, Rupert Bear, coming in to land.  
Almasy doesn't look up.

The Arab continues to talk.  The newly-arrived Katharine has scrambled 
up the hill to speak to Almásy.

			KATHARINE
				(diffident)
		Hello.  Not to interrupt but
		we're celebrating.

She makes to leave but Almásy puts up a hand to keep Katharine there, 
but quiet.

			ALMÁSY
		This is an incredible story - about a man
		hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me
		about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there,
		but his map, the route he's describing,
		he couldn't survive the journey now, but
		he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and
		now we're onto an Ostrich.
				(to the Arab in ARABIC)
		I'm telling her your map is poetry.

The Arab shrugs.

			KATHARINE
		What do you mean, poetry?

			ALMÁSY
		A mountain curved like a woman's back, 
		a plateau the shape of an ear.

			KATHARINE
		Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does
		the Ostrich come in?

			ALMÁSY
		The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts
		an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do
		with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must
		appear not to move.  The man finds a place
		where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands
		where the ostrich can see him, on the
		horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat -
		otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall,
		he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the
		ostrich comes the next day, the man is
		there, but he's nearer.
				(to the guide)
		Haunting the ostrich.

The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family,
		not just the meat, but by selling the 
		feathers, beak, the skin, a year from
		this one animal.  So, each day the
		man gets closer.  And the ostrich is
		not sure - has something changed? -
		now the standing man is only a few
		yards from where it feeds.  And then
		one day, the man is in the wadi, in
		the water.  And the Ostrich comes, as
		always, dips into the water and the
		man JUMPS UP - and captures it.

He shrugs.  The Arab has more to say.  Almásy doesn't respond, quieting 
him with a dismissive gesture.

			KATHARINE
		What is he saying?
				(Almasy, awkward, shakes his head)
		Come on, what did he say?

			ALMÁSY
		He said - be careful.

			KATHARINE
		Be careful?  You mean you - or me?  Who?

			ALMÁSY
				(to the Arab)
		Her or me?

The Arab speaks again.  Almasy speaks without looking at her.

			ALMÁSY
		The one who appears not to be moving.


64*.	INT.    TENT.   BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.

Katharine comes in.  Then, a beat, and Almásy.  Clifton is holding up 
the champagne.  

			CLIFTON
		Gentlemen, to Zerzura.

			ALL
		Zerzura.

			MADOX
		And a special thank you to Geoffrey
		and Katharine, without whose
		fund-raising heroics we should 
		still be kicking our heels.

They toast the Cliftons.

			CLIFTON
		To arm-twisting.

			MADOX
				(to Almásy)
		Did Katharine say? - 
		Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.

			CLIFTON
		Have to return the favor - take a few
		photographs for the army.

			KATHARINE
		Darling, Peter says I could stay...

			MADOX
				(checking with Almásy)
		Why not?

			ALMÁSY
		What kind of photographs?

			CLIFTON
		Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's
		wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier
		at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.

			KATHARINE
				(to Clifton)
		Why do you think?  About my staying?

			CLIFTON
		Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then
		I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft...

			KATHARINE
				(playfully poking his ribs)
		Oh.

			CLIFTON
		But finally able to explore the Cairo
		night-life.  I shall produce an
		authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars
		and - I want to say Harems - am I in
		the right country for Harems?


65*.	EXT.     BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    MORNING.

As Clifton prepares to leave in the Steerman, Almásy approaches.

			ALMÁSY
		Safe journey.

			CLIFTON
		You too.  Good luck!

			ALMÁSY
		Clifton - your wife - do you think
		it's appropriate to leave her?

			CLIFTON
		Appropriate?

			ALMÁSY
		I think the desert is, it's - for a
		woman - it's very tough, I wonder 
		if it's not too much for her.

			CLIFTON
		Are you mad?  Katharine loves it
		here. She told me yesterday.

			ALMÁSY
		All the same, I, were I you I would
		be concerned -

			CLIFTON
		I've known Katharine since she was
		three, my aunt is her aunt, we were
		practically brother and sister before
		we were man and wife.  I think I'd
		know what is and what isn't too much
		for her.  I think she's know herself.

			ALMÁSY
		Very well.

			CLIFTON
				(laughing it off)
		Why are you people so threatened 
		by a woman?!

He settles into the controls.  Almásy watches the plane taxi away.  
Doesn't move at all.  Katharine waves from the tent as the Steerman 
takes off.


65a*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.

The THREE FORD CARS leave the campsite, loaded for a scouting 
expedition.  The rest of the party, Bedouin, tents, camels and Tiger 
Moth is left behind.  Madox shouts last-minute instructions from the 
window of his car.


66*.	EXT.    DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

FENELON-BARNES sits astride his camel, and wipes away the sweat.  The 
desert stretches for miles, shimmering, the sun baking the sand.  His 
GUIDES wind their headcloths tighter.  Nobody speaks.  Then one of them 
looks round, raises a hand.  A BUZZING noise.  They all turn.  A SMALL 
CLOUD OF DUST EMERGES OVER A RIDGE.  Locusts?  A sandstorm?

A CARAVAN OF CARS, the Almásy/Madox expedition, bumps along, 
suspensions threatened by the constant dips and ridges.  On each car 
there are three in the passenger cabin, the open backs crammed with 
drums of gasoline and water and equipment.  On the front vehicle, the 
tenth member of the party, KAMAL, acts as a navigator and sits on a 
CAMEL SADDLE, a rodeo cowboy, on the roof of the leading car, driven by 
Madox.  As they spot FENELON-BARNES they sound their horns and wave 
good-naturedly.  F-B scowls, watches them roar by, stealing his 
thunder.


66a*.	EXT.  DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   DAY.

ONE OF THE CARS IS HOPELESSLY BOGGED DOWN IN HEAVY SAND.  It's contents 
have been unloaded, and a rope ladder is being inserted under the 
tires.  The entire company huff and puff and argue about the best means 
of extricating the vehicle.


67*.	INT.    CAR EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

LATER - Almásy drives the second car, accompanied by Katharine and Al 
Auf.  Katharine breaks the long silence.

			KATHARINE
		I've been thinking about - how does
		somebody like you decide to come to
		the desert?  What is it?  You're doing
		whatever you're doing - in your castle,
		or wherever it is you live, and one day,
		you say, I have to go to the desert - or what?

Almásy doesn't answer.  Katharine, who has looked at him for an answer, 
looks away.  There's another long silence.

			ALMÁSY
		I once traveled with a terrific guide,
		who was taking me to Faya.  He didn't
		speak for nine hours.  At the end of
		it he pointed at the horizon and 
		said - Faya!  That was a good day!

Point made, they lapse again into silence.  Katharine boils.

			KATHARINE
		Actually, you sing.

			ALMÁSY
		Pardon?

			KATHARINE
		You sing.  All the time.

			ALMÁSY
		I do not.

			KATHARINE
		Ask Al Auf.

Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.  He laughs, nods.

			KATHARINE
				(sings wickedly)
		I'll be down to get you in the taxi,
		honey, you'd better be ready about
		half-past eight...!

Al Auf nods and grins furiously, joins in, impersonating Almásy.  
Almásy grunts in irritation.


68*.	EXT.  NEAR THE BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  DUSK.

The group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif.  They climb 
slowly.  Below them, A NEW AND TEMPORARY BASE CAMP.

The group winds around the rock.  Almásy turns to offer a hand to 
Katharine behind him, pulling her up to the next rock slab.  She smiles 
at him.  He smiles back curtly, continues.

The group stops at a level plateau.  The Arabs stand apart and SING 
THEIR PRAYERS AT DUSK.  Al Auf leads the incantations.

			AL AUF
		Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar...

The westerners wait respectfully.  As the sun sets in glory, Almásy 
looks over at the range of rocks.  One particular range seems to look 
exactly like A WOMAN'S BACK.  He squints at the rock.  Almásy 
discreetly pulls out his COMPASS.


69*.	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DUSK.

Almásy clambers up the rocks, coming through a narrow crevice to find A 
NATURAL SHELF.  He scrambles up this path, reaching up, only to notice 
that his hand almost perfectly covers A PAINTED HAND on the rock, and 
as he digests this he realizes he has climbed past what is THE MOUTH OF 
A CAVE.  He disappears inside.


70	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

A FLASHLIGHT squirts into the cave.  Almásy treads cautiously along the 
narrow winding passage.  He comes to an open cavern and takes his 
flashlight up to a wall.  PAINTINGS EMERGE, figures, animals,  ancient 
pictures.  A giraffe.  Cattle.  Fish.  Men with bows and arrows.  
Almásy is astonished by what he sees.


71*.	EXT.    NEAR THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    EVENING.

The others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks as 
Almásy comes scrambling down, transformed into an excited teenager.

			ALMÁSY
		Madox!  Madox!

He slithers in a heap in front of the astonished expedition party.  
Doesn't care.


72	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

Almásy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave.  Now Madox 
comes alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining Almásy's and 
increasing the visibility of the paintings.  A dark-skinned figure, 
apparently in the process of DIVING into water, comes clearly into 
view.  Then others supine, arms outstretched.

			MADOX
				(with audible excitement)
		My God, they're swimming!

The others crowd round.  FIVE EXCITED FACES IN THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE 
CAVE.


73*.	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

A hive of activity.  The team has set up TRESTLES to catalogue the 
finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of detritus, which they 
empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is cleared out.  Entering the 
cave, Almásy passes with camera equipment, just as D'Ag emerges 
carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved DESERT FOX.  D'Ag gestures 
to Almasy with his customary enthusiasm, holding up the body of the 
fox.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Have you seen this?  Astonishing.
		Perfectly preserved.


74	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Inside, Bermann is setting up LAMPS, running wires from a car BATTERY.  
Kamal is helping him.  And as Almásy arrives he catches a tiny moment 
of tenderness between them.  Bermann, seeing him, quickly disengages 
and busies himself with the lights.  At another wall, Katharine is 
catching.


75	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

The CARS are heading back to Basecamp.  They bounce over the sand.


76*.	INT.    BERMANN'S CAR.    DAY.

Bermann is driving the lead CAR along some STEEP DUNES.  Almásy beside 
him.  Bermann is peeling AN ORANGE, a segment of which he holds out of 
the window.  Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and collects it, his 
head dipping in to grin at Bermann.  Bermann looks uneasily as Almásy.  
He wants to tell him of his passion, of his absolute love for Kamal, 
but he daren't.

			BERMANN
		I love the desert, you see.  That's my,
		that's my - I can't think of the word.
				(Almásy nods)
		How do you explain?  To someone who's
		never been here?  Feelings which seem
		quite normal.

			ALMÁSY
				(compassionate)
		I don't know, my friend.  I don't know.

Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim 
brown hand collect it.  A MOMENTARY DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM 
TO MISJUDGE THE LINE AND SUDDENLY THE DUNE COLLAPSES UNDER THE TIRE AND 
THE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE.  D'Ag - following, 
Fouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can't stop his own car from 
being caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND 
INTO BERMANN'S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS CRUNCH, the radiator 
exploding.  Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a little way behind, 
manages to stay clear of the trouble.  He jumps out of the vehicle and 
slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out 
of the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the 
wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of 
oil spreading ominously.


77*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
 
LATER and the group have cleaned up as best as possible.  D'Ag, 
Bermann, and Fouad are a little worse for wear.  Fouad's arm is in a 
sling, and D'Ag is sporting a bloody head-bandage.  Bermann has broken 
a finger and is being attended to by Madox.  The luggage, water and 
petrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining 
car.  Almásy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle.  He's 
having no success.


78*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

Almásy, Kamal and two of the other young Bedouin stand around the mess 
of the two broken vehicles.  The ONE WORKING CAR is loaded with men and 
provisions.  Katharine sits inside, next to Madox, Almásy comes over to 
her window, to speak past her to Madox.

			MADOX
		I'll be back as quick as I can.  
		Thirty-six hours at the outside.

			ALMÁSY
		Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury
		it between here and the Pottery Hill.
		And a better jack.  We planned badly.

			MADOX
				(nods at Almásy, then shouts over 
to the wrecked vehicles)
		Bermann!

This is Bermann's cue to take leave of Kamal who is staying behind.  
Kamal makes a little bow.

			KAMAL
		May God make safety your companion.

Bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car which jolts off, 
bouncing over the track.

THE VEHICLE GETS ABOUT TWENTY YARDS, ALMASY WATCHING, BEFORE IT SINKS 
FORLORNLY INTO THE SOFT SAND.  IT'S HOPELESSLY OVERLOADED WITH PEOPLE.  
THEY ALL GET OUT.

			KATHARINE
		I shall stay behind, of course

			MADOX
		Certainly not.

			KATHARINE
		I insist.  There clearly isn't room for
		us all, I'm the least able to dig, and 
		I'm not one of the walking wounded.
		Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain
		it's the most effective method of
		persuading my husband to abandon
		whatever he's doing and rescue us.

It's hard to argue with this logic.  Almásy shrugs.

LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure.  And Almasy and 
Katharine are left alone.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this 
for the first time.  Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged 
vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent 
TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS.  Katharine goes to 
join them.  There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles 
of undulating dunes.


79	INT.    SHELTER.    DAY.

Almásy sits alone, writing into HIS HERODOTUS, a map folded in front of 
him, from which he makes notes.  Katherine comes across with a clutch 
of her SKETCHES from the Cave wall.  Hands them to him.  They're 
beautiful.

			ALMÁSY
		What's this?

			KATHARINE
		I thought you might paste them
		into your book.

			ALMÁSY
		We took several photographs,
		there's no need.

			KATHARINE
		I'd like you to have them.

			ALMÁSY
				(handing them back)
		There's really no need.  This is
		just a scrapbook.  I should feel
		obliged.  Thank you.

			KATHARINE
				(exasperated)
		And that would be unconscionable,
		I suppose, to feel any obligation?  
		Yes.  Of course it would.

She's already turning, walking as far from him as the cramped shelter 
permits.  He continues with his maps.


80	EXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune, smoking, surveying the 
landscape.  Below her the makeshift camp - a fresh wind flicking at the 
tarpaulin, THE DEEP TRACKS OF MADOX'S CAR STRETCHING OFF TOWARDS 
CIVILIZATION.  Almásy emerges from the tent and, locating Katharine, 
heads towards her.

			ALMÁSY
		You should come into the shelter.

			KATHARINE
		I'm quite all right, thank you.

			ALMÁSY
		Look over there.

Katharine turns, scans the horizon.

			KATHARINE
		What am I looking at?

			ALMÁSY
		See what's happening to them -
		the stars.

			KATHARINE
		They're so untidy.  I'm just trying 
		to rearrange them.

			ALMÁSY
		In an hour there will be no stars.
		The air is filling with sand.

He offers a hand.  A little reluctantly she takes it.


81	EXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

The team hurries around the improvised tent, weighing it down with 
packing cases, gasoline drums, water cans, bringing anything loose or 
light inside the tarpaulin.  THE WIND is whipping up, the air busy with 
sand.  Almásy pushes everyone under cover.


82	INT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

THE SAND SEEMS TO BE SCOURING THE TARPAULIN.  Kamal and Almásy try to 
secure one vulnerable area, but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and 
the sand swarms inside.

It's noisy, too, and Almásy has to shout to make himself understood, 
indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and blankets and food, all the 
valuables, and get out.  He himself finds blankets and water and shouts 
at Katharine to do the same.  One side of the canvas suddenly RIPS 
apart like paper. Chaos as figures struggle in ever-worsening 
conditions, sand blizzarding the air.


83	EXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

THE SHELTER FLIES INTO THE AIR, stranding the figures, their heads 
wrapped in blankets, flashlights useless.  They seek safety in two 
groups, the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and 
Almásy to the upright one.


84	INT.    CAR.    NIGHT.

Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and Almásy 
sit without speaking.  Dawn is trying to break through.  He pours a 
little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses 
and mouths.  She takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it, 
then dries his.

			KATHARINE
		This is not very good, is it?

			ALMÁSY
		No.

			KATHARINE
		Shall we be all right?

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  Absolutely.

			KATHARINE
		Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.


85	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAWN.

The sand is piling up against the two cars, the tent is swept from its 
moorings, the water cans are hurled up too, and then plunge ominously 
into sand drifts as if going under an ocean.

			ALMÁSY (O/S)
		...let me tell you about winds.  There
		is a whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the 
		Aajej, against which the fellahin defend
		themselves with knives.  The Ghibli from
		Tunis rolls and rolls and produces a 
		rather strange nervous condition...

And we hear Katharine's laugh.


86	INT.    CAR.    DAWN.

Almasy sits alongside Katharine, whose head is against his shoulder.  
He continues his story of winds.

			ALMÁSY
		#NAME?
		Which Mariners called the sea of
		darkness.  Red sand from this wind
		has flown as far as the south coast
		of England, producing showers so
		dense they were mistaken for blood.

Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.

			KATHARINE
		Fiction.  We had a house on that coast
		and it never rained blood.  Go on.  More.

			ALMÁSY
		All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells
		of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a
		nation declared war on it and marched
		out to fight it in full battle dress, 
		their swords raised.


87*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

MORNING.  The sand has almost COMPLETELY ENGULFED the car on the 
exposed side, covering the windshield like snow, and encroaching onto 
the door of the protected flank.


88*.	INT.    CAR.    DAY.

Almásy is woken by sound of A DISTANT ENGINE.  He jerks up, waking 
Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door.  He can't open 
it, and has to lean his feet against the passenger door, lying across 
Katharine, kicking it open.


89*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

By the time Almásy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the 
cabin, MADOX'S CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE HORIZON.  Almásy waves, shouts, 
and then runs back into the car, finds his flare-gun, and SENDS A FLARE 
high into the sky.  Katharine is with him now, and they watch, 
helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a 
mission.  Katharine panics, THE SAND HAS ERASED ALL TRACES OF THEM.  
She speaks quietly, shocked.

			KATHARINE
		Our tracks, where are they?

Almásy is preoccupied.  He's gone back to their vehicle and returns 
with a shovel, STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY.

			ALMÁSY
		Madox will have calculated how many
		miles, they'll soon turn around.

			KATHARINE
				(realizing what he's doing)
		Oh my God, the others!

She kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand WHICH HAS 
COMPLETELY ENGULFED THE OTHER VEHICLE containing the three Bedouin.

			ALMÁSY
				(during this)
		Could I ask you, please, to paste you
		paintings into my book?  I should like
		to have them.  I should be honored.

			KATHARINE
		Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible
		coward to ask how much water we have?

			ALMÁSY
				(shoveling hard)
		Water?  Yes, we have water, we have
		a little in our can, we have water in
		the radiator which can be drunk.  Not
		at all cowardly, extremely practical.
				(anxious at not uncovering
the boys, egging himself on)
		Come on, come on!
				(then back to Katharine)
		There's also a plant - I've never seen
		it but I'm told you can cut a piece the
		size of a heart from this plant and
		the next day it will be filled with a
		delicious liquid.

			KATHARINE
		Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.

They hear NOISES, scrabbling, faint thumps.  Almásy scrapes at the sand 
and they find the glass of the car.  The angle of the cab, tilted up to 
the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open.  
Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating.  Almásy pulls the door and it 
cranks open.


90*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus.  
It's full of ALMÁSY'S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME PRESSED FLOWERS.  
She deciphers a page of his words and drawings.  It's almost 
exclusively about her, the lines studded with K.s.  She reads, 
astonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle 
the area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners, 
like Kip searches for mines.  Kamal is slumped against the front of the 
car.  He's sick.  Almásy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to 
shovel into the sand.  He pulls out A CAN OF WATER.  Turns to Katharine 
and holds it triumphantly in the air.


91*.	INT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

There's a small, weak fire.  The group crouch around it.  The boys talk 
noisily to Almásy.  Kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering.  
Almásy gives him water, speaks to Katherine.

			ALMÁSY
		Kamal is passing blood.  He must have
		had some internal damage in the crash.
		He needs medicine.  I think we must risk
		the other flare.

He gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge.  
This time the effect is dramatic with A RED UMBRELLA OF LIGHT.  
Katharine comes up beside him.  They wait, hope fading with the flare.

			KATHARINE
				(blank)
		Geoffrey's not in Cairo.
				(Almásy looks at her)
		He's not actually a buffoon.  And
		the plane wasn't a wedding
		present.  It belongs to the British
		Government.  They want aerial
		maps of the whole North Africa.
		So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In
		case you were counting on his 
		sudden appearance.

			ALMÁSY
		And the marriage - is that a fiction?

There's a beat.  Katharine has a hundred answers.

			KATHARINE
		No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark.  
Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, AN ANSWERING FLARE 
fireworks into the sky.

			KATHARINE
		Thank God.  Oh, thank God.

There's excited shouting from the two fit boys.  They leap up and run 
towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not 
come from Madox, but from an approaching CAMEL CARAVAN.  Almásy shouts 
to the boys for some identification.

			KATHARINE
		Do they know them?

			ALMÁSY
				(squinting at the horizon)
		No, but I think I do.

The Caravan slowly comes into focus.  IT'S FENELON-BARNES.  Katharine 
touches Almásy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture.

			KATHARINE
		Am I K. in your book?  
		I think I must be.

Almásy turns to her.  He runs the blade of his arm across her neck - 
the sweat leaving a clear stripe.

Fenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses 
Almásy.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I recollect your saying to ignore
		your bones but I assume you have
		no objection to my rescuing your
		companion?
				(to Katharine)
		Good evening, Mrs. Clifton.

			KATHARINE
				(accepting his handshake)
		Hello.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'd like to introduce you to my camel -
		the most notable beast on earth.
				(to Almásy)
		I understand you found some
		remarkable caves.

A goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine.  She drinks and hands 
it to Almásy.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Paintings of swimmers?  Remarkable.


92	EXT.    CAIRO.    DAY.

ANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing Almásy and Katharine 
negotiates the incredible bustle of Cairo.


93	EXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.

Almásy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from 
the cab, and pulls Katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds 
open the door for her.  As she walks towards the hotel, he hands her 
bag to a porter.  Katharine is stung.

			KATHARINE
		Will you not come in?

			ALMÁSY
		No.

			KATHARINE
		Will you please come in?

			ALMÁSY
				(a beat)
		Mrs. Clifton -

	Katharine turns, disgusted.

			KATHARINE
		Don't.  

			ALMÁSY
		I believe you still have my book.

Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then 
disappears.


94	INT.    ALMÁSY'S ROOM.    DAY.

Almásy lying on a camp bed, face down.  The walls are covered with 
maps, enlargements of photographs.  A fan whirs over his kit which is 
spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor.  An ineffably male 
room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing 
the gloom.  Almásy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked 
off below his jutting feet.  

There's A KNOCK at the door.  Almásy sleeps.  Another.  A third.  He's 
roused from the dead.  Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the 
knocking continues.

It's Katharine.  She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the 
afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress.  She walks past him into 
the room.  He closes the door.  She turns.  He KNEELS before her, head 
at her thighs.  She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go 
to his head.

			KATHARINE
		You still have sand in your hair.

She starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders, violently.  He pulls 
back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face.  She kneels 
and covers his face with kisses.  He pulls blindly at her dress and it 
RIPS across her breasts.


95*.	INT.    BATHROOM.    DAY.

Almásy is in the bath.  Katharine, wearing his dressing gown, pours in 
a jug of steaming water.  Almásy leans over the rim of the bath.  He's 
sewing, carefully repairing the torn dress.

			KATHARINE
		I'm impressed you can sew.

			ALMÁSY
		Good.

			KATHARINE
		You sew very badly.

			ALMÁSY
		You don't sew at all!

			KATHARINE
		A woman should never learn to sew,
		and if she can she should never
		admit to it.  Close your eyes.

			ALMÁSY
				(laughs)
		That makes it harder still.

She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head, 
then begins to shampoo his hair.

Almásy is in heaven.  The biggest smile we have seen from him.  She 
continues to massage his scalp.

			ALMÁSY
		When were you most happy?

			KATHARINE
		Now.

			ALMÁSY
		When were you least happy?

			KATHARINE
				(a beat)
		Now.

			ALMÁSY
		Okay.  And what do you love?
		Say everything.

			KATHARINE
		What do I love?  I love rice pudding,
		and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs!
		The gardens at our house in Freshwater -
		all my secret paths.

She rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN BESIDE HIM, 
covering his neck and shoulders in kisses.

			ALMÁSY
		What else?

			KATHARINE
		Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not
		with other people!  Islands.  Your
		handwriting.  I could go on all day.
				(a beat)
		My husband.

	Almásy nods.

			ALMÁSY
		What do you hate most?

			KATHARINE
		A lie.  What do you hate most?

			ALMÁSY
		Ownership.  Being owned.  When
		you leave, you should forget me.

She freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then 
SLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face.

She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and 
walks, dripping, out of the room.


96*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

To the Patient it's as if Katharine is walking out of his wall.  He 
sighs with pain, then looks away to where Hana has fallen asleep on the 
bed, almost on top of him.  He touches her.   He speaks as if each word 
burns him.

			THE PATIENT
		Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry -
		but when you turn, the sheets, I can't
		really bear the sheets moving over me.  
		Sorry.

			HANA
				(mortified, moving quickly)
		Yes, of course, I'm so sorry.
		Stupid of me.

	Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.

			HANA
		I'm so sorry.


97*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Hana comes to the table, carrying a jug of water and a bowl.   She's 
still sad.  She unbuttons her dress, pulling it off her shoulder, 
begins to pour the water to cool herself against the night's pressing 
heat.


98*.	EXT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.   1944.    LATE DAY.

The EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL is a cluster of tents practically ahead of 
the Front Line SPORADIC GUN FIRE, LIGHT AND HEAVY, SOUNDS THROUGHOUT.  
Mary walks by on her way to the Nurse's tent.  It's 1944 and the war in 
Italy is still intense.


99	INT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL TENT.    LATE DAY.

JAN is washing out of her HELMET, and stands naked in her socks.  Hana 
is using a flannel to wash Jan's back.  A couple of other girls like, 
exhausted, on their cots.  The mud is everywhere.  Another nurse is 
making tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus.

MARY comes in and flops down.  She's GIVEN BLOOD and is pale and 
enervated.

			MARY
		Okay, Type Os, the vampires wait.
		Everybody's giving a pint.

			JAN
		Ugh!  If they were sucking it out
		I wouldn't mind.  It's the needle
		I can't stand.

			HANA
				(laughing)
		You're a nurse - how ca you be
		frightened of needles!


100	INT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.

Hana walks through the main TRIAGE TENT.  It's packed with the ruined 
bodies of the injured, swaddled in bloody bandages.  Hana stops at a 
couple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients.  She stops at 
another bed, leans over its occupant.  His bandaged face is bloated and 
yellow.  He's not breathing.  She bends over him, his open eyes fixed 
in a glassy stare.  No pulse.  She snaps the triangular cardboard ID 
from his bed to indicate HE'S DIED.  Then tenderly closes his eyes.  
THEY SUDDENLY SNAP OPEN.  HE REARS UP, GRABBING HER.

			WOUNDED SOLDIER
		Can't wait to have me dead?  You bitch!

He slaps her hand away.  Slaps at the tubes going into his arm.  Hana 
is absolutely shocked.  But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi-
consciousness.

Shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes 
it again.  He is in terrible pain.  His face creased with anger.  Now 
his hand is clutching at hers.  She tries to soothe him.

			HANA
		Try t be calm.  Ssssshhh.  Come on.
		Be calm now.  Ssshhhh.  Be peaceful.
		It's okay.  It's okay.

HIS FACE STILLS.  HIS HAND LOOSENS.  Now he has gone.  As Hana inspects 
him, a shell seems to land close by.  THE LIGHTS FLICKER.  She ducks, 
along with everyone else.

Below the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's 
possessions.  They include A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES.


101	INT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  EVENING.

HANA, WEARING THE TENNIS SHOES, IS GIVING BLOOD.  She lies in a cot, 
next to JAN.  The shelling sounds closer.

OLIVER, the Doctor, is working on the most recent patient, a young 
CANADIAN Boy who is critically ill - the tubes hanging above him, of 
plasma and of blood.  The curtain drawn around him is pulled back, to 
reveal the two nurses in the background.  The Soldier can just see 
them.  He's going to die any minute.  

			CANADIAN SOLDIER
				(whispering to Oliver)
		Is there anybody here from Picton?

			OLIVER
		Picton?  I don't know.

			CANADIAN SOLDIER
		I'd like to see somebody from home
		before I go.

Hana can only really hear Oliver's end of this conversation, but the 
mention of Canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that 
Stuart is dead.

			HANA 
				(to Oliver)
		Why Picton?

			OLIVER
		He's from there - edge of Lake
		Ontario right, Soldier?

The boy nods.

			JAN 
				(innocent)
		Where's your Stuart from?
		Somewhere near there, isn't it?

			HANA
				(to Oliver)
		As him what company he's with?

Oliver leans over, then turns to Hana.

			OLIVER
		Third Canadian Fusiliers.

			HANA
		Does he know a Captain McGann?

The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.

			CANADIAN SOLDIER
		He bought it.  Yesterday.  Shot to bits.

The shells are getting closer.

			HANA
		What did he say?

			OLIVER
				(can't look at her)
		Doesn't know him.

A SHELL SUDDENLY LANDS ON TOP OF THE SITE, PERHAPS FIFTY YARDS FROM THE 
TENT.  THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  THEN ANOTHER LANDS.

Everybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet.

Hana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on.  Oliver is 
next to her in the mud.  Her heart is breaking.

			HANA
		He's gone, hasn't he?

			OLIVER
		No.  He's - no.

			HANA
		Oh God.  Oh God.

The shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but 
each explosion illuminates it for a moment.


102	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Caravaggio comes into the kitchen.  Hana is slumped at the table, her 
back naked.  The jug of water in front of her.  She's sobbing, her 
shoulders heaving.  Caravaggio approaches tentatively.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hana?
				(he touches her shoulder)
		Hana?  Are you alright?

			HANA
				(without raising her head)
		Don't touch me if you're going to
		try and fuck me.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(soothing)
		I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.

She reaches for her blouse, wraps it around herself.  Her face is read 
with weeping.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(gently)
		You have to protect yourself from 
		sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.
				(drinking the water)
		You're in love with him, aren't you?
		Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint
		or something?  Because of the way he 
		looks?  I don't think he is.

			HANA
		I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love
		with ghosts.  And so is he.  He's in
		love with ghosts.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Who are his ghosts?

			HANA
		Ask him.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(he holds up his hands)
		What if I told you he did this to me?

			HANA
				(stung)
		What?  How could he have?  When?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't
		even know.  It's like he slammed a
		door in Cairo and it trapped my 
		fucking hands in Tobruk.

			HANA
		I don't know what that means.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(shrugs)
		Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is.
		Ask him who he's killed.

			HANA
				(furious)
		Please don't creep around this house.


103*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana sits reading from the Herodotus.  She shows the Patient the page 
where a CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER covered in handwriting has been glued 
in.

			HANA
		Tell me about this, this is in your
		handwriting - December 22nd -
		Betrayals in war are childlike 
		compared with our betrayals during
		peace.  New lovers are nervous and
		tender, but smash everything - for
		the heart is an organ of fire...
				(she looks up)
		I love that, I believe that.
				(to him)
		Who is K?

			THE PATIENT
		K is for Katharine.


104	EXT.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, DECEMBER 1938.  DAY.

A CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR THE TROOPS.  The incongruous attempts to create a 
traditional Christmas in the dusty heat of Cairo.  

The Party is in the courtyard of the Moorish Palace which serves as the 
private residence of the British Ambassador, SIR RONNIE HAMPTON.  Lots 
of Wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine help serve tea and cake 
to the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and 
paper hats.  A man dressed as SANTA CLAUS is giving out presents - 
PENGUIN PAPERBACKS, CHOCOLATE.  Music blares out from a loudspeaker.  
Officers and Civilians walk the parameter.  One of these, arriving, is 
Almasy.  He sits in the shade, catches Katharine's attention.  
Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with Christmas cake 
on it.

			ALMÁSY
		Say you're sick.

			KATHARINE
		What?  No!

			ALMÁSY
		Say you're feeling faint - the sun.

			KATHARINE
				(but a frisson)
		No.

			ALMÁSY
		I can't work.  I can't sleep.

Lady Hampton calls impatiently.

			LADY HAMPTON
		Katharine!

			KATHARINE
		Coming.
				(to Almásy)
		I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting
		in the middle of the night.  Geoffrey
		thinks it's the thing in the desert,
		the trauma.

			ALMÁSY
		I can still taste you.

			KATHARINE
				(waving at another woman who
pushes a trolley with teapots)
		This is empty, just coming!

			ALMÁSY
		I'm trying to write with your taste
		in my mouth.
				(as she leaves)
		Swoon.  I'll catch you.

Almásy sits watching the party.  The Santa Claus is dragged outside by 
some excited Children.  Almásy picks at his cake removing the thick 
marzipan icing.  He's writing on A CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER, smoothing 
it out - December 22nd.  Betrayals in war are childlike compared with 
out betrayals du...

Katharine, attending to a raucous table, suddenly sags at the knees, 
and SWOONS.  People rush to her.

			KATHARINE
		I'm fine.  How silly.

			OFFICER'S WIFE
				(helping her to her feet)
		It's the heat.

			LADY HAMPTON
		You should sit down, darling.
				(to the others)
		She's quite all right.
				(escorts Katharine away)
		Are you pregnant?

			KATHARINE
		I don't think so.

			LADY HAMPTON
				(squeezing her arm)
		How romantic.  With Fiona I fell
		over every five minutes.  Ronnie
		Christened me Lady Downfall.

			KATHARINE
		I think I might go inside and sit
		down for a few minutes.

			LADY HAMPTON
		I'll come with you.

			KATHARINE
		No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine.

They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.


105	INT.  STORE ROOM.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.  DAY.

A small STOREROOM inside the Palace - Brooms, Mops, Cleaning Equipment.  
Outside, the party is visible as opaque shadows through the beveled 
glass of the ornate window.  The sound of carols sung by the enlisted 
men gives way to a version of SILENT NIGHT played on a solitary 
bagpipe.  Inside, ALMÁSY AND KATHARINE MAKE LOVE IN THE DARKNESS.  
Everything is too fast, desperate, standing up, grabbing, hoisting 
clothes.


106	INT.    CORRIDORS.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    DAY.

A CORRIDOR.  Almásy appears and almost immediately collides with the 
man dressed as SANTA CLAUS.  He moves to one side.  

			CLIFTON
		Have you seen Katharine?

			ALMÁSY
				(taken aback)
		What?

			CLIFTON
		It's Geoffrey under this.

			ALMÁSY
		I haven't, no.  Sorry.


106a*.	INT.    SIDE ROOM IN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    DAY.

Geoffrey continues scouting the warren of tiny rooms that run off the 
central courtyard.  He finds Katharine sitting in one, smoking, 
surrounded by oppressive and elaborate tiling.  Clifton wonders briefly 
how Almásy had missed Katharine.

			CLIFTON
		Darling, I just heard.  You poor
		sausage, are you all right?

			KATHARINE
		I'm fine.  I got hot.

			CLIFTON
		Lady H said she thought you might be -

			KATHARINE
		I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.

			CLIFTON
		Right.

			KATHARINE
		Aren't you?

			CLIFTON
		Sweltering.
				(taking off his hat and beard)
		Come on, I'll take you home.

			KATHARINE
		Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe.
		Aren't you dying for green, anything
		green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel
		rain on your face?  It's Christmas and 
		it's all - I don't know - if you asked me
		I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.

			CLIFTON
		Sweetheart, you know we can't go
		home, there might be a war.

			KATHARINE
				(poking at his costume)
		Geoffrey, you do so love putting
		on a disguise.

			CLIFTON
		I do so love you.
				(he kisses her head)
		What do you smell of?

			KATHARINE
		What?

			CLIFTON
		Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan
		in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.


107*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

The Patient lies alone in his room.  CLIFTON'S FACE stares back at him 
from among the frescoes.  Then something distracts him.

			THE PATIENT
		Are you outside?

A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I can't hide anymore.
				(jerks up his hands)
		I breathe like a dog.  I lose my
		balance.  Stealing's got harder.

Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Why do I feel if I had your book I
		would know everything?

			THE PATIENT
		I don't even know if it is my book.
		The Bedouin found it in the plane,
		in the wreckage.  It's mine now.  
		I heard your breathing and thought
		it might be rain.  I'm dying for rain -
		of course I'm dying anyway - but I
		long to feel rain on my face.

Caravaggio comes close, scrutinizing the face, trying to repair the 
features.  Exasperated.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Is it you?  If I said Moose... I look
		different, fuck, why shouldn't you?

			THE PATIENT
				(impassive)
		Moose.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(a different tack)
		First wedding anniversary - what
		do you call it?

			THE PATIENT
		I don't know.  Paper.  Is it?  Paper?
				(sharp, not wanting to think)
		I don't remember.


108	INT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana stands at the PIANO.  It's still lop-sided, propped against the 
wall.  She tries but can't move it.  So she pulls off the dust-sheet 
and, with the instrument still on a tilt, begins to play the Aria from 
Bach's Goldberg Variations.


109	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA'S PIANO CONTINUES.  Upstairs, Caravaggio chats with the Patient 
while working his arms to RAISE A VEIN, a boot-lace tied around it, 
preparing an injection for himself, tapping the syringe.  During this:

			THE PATIENT
		I have come to love that little tap of
		the fingernail against the syringe.  Tap.


110*.	INT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana plays.  GUN SHOTS punctuates the music.  She's totally engrossed 
and only hears the second or third shot.  Her hands falter, she looks 
up to see A SIKH SOLDIER RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD WAVING HIS ARMS, his 
REVOLVER held aloft.  He approaches the door, his face creased with 
anxiety, and raps on the shattered frame.  It's KIP.

She gets up and walks past Kip standing at the door, and continues the 
seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden VIA THE HOLE 
RIPPED OUT OF THE WALL.

			HANA
		Excuse me.  Yes?
				(of the doors)
		I don't have the key to that door.

			KIP
		The Germans were here.  The Germans 
		were all over this area.  They left mines
		everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite
		hiding places.  

			HANA
		I see.
				(then mischievous)
		Then may be you're safe as long as
		you only play Bach.  He's German.

Kip is looking around the piano.  Hana giggles.

			KIP
		Is something funny?

			HANA
		No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry.
		You came to the doors, that's all and -
				(a little laugh)
		#NAME?
		worried about mines.  That's all.

			KIP
		I've met you before.

			HANA
		I don't think so.

Hana bends to see what Kip's looking at under the piano.  Wires run 
from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an EXPLOSIVE 
CHARGE.   If Hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have 
triggered the charge.  Kip looks at Hana who conceals her dismay with a 
shrug.


110a*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DUSK.

Across from the terrace, HARDY AND KIP ARE PUTTING UP THEIR TENTS.  
Caravaggio stands, chatting amiably to them, holding a haversack, 
smoking a cigarette.


111*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DUSK.

Hana looks down from the Patient's room, watching the tents go up.

			HANA
		He wants us to move out, says there
		could be fifty more mines in the building.
		He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at
		him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.

			THE PATIENT
		Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.

Kip glances up at the window.  Hana, suddenly shy, backs away.

			HANA
		I'll probably marry him.

			THE PATIENT
		Really?  That's sudden.

			HANA
		My mother always told me I would
		summon my husband by playing the piano.

She goes over to the Patient's bed.

			HANA
		I liked it better when there were
		just the two of us.

			THE PATIENT
		Why?  Is he staying?

			HANA
		With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.

			THE PATIENT
		We should charge!  Doesn't anyone
		have a job to do?

			HANA
		They have to clear all the local roads
		of mines.  That's a big job.  They won't
		stay in the house.  They're putting up
		their tent in the garden.

			THE PATIENT
		In that case, I suppose we can't charge.


112*.	INT.    OFFICE, BRITISH HQ.    CAIRO.    DAY.

A SMALL OFFICE, shared by two men, and a mountain of filing cabinets 
and paper.  There are AERIAL MAPS all over the walls.  Clifton is on 
the telephone, while his colleague, RUPERT DOUGLAS, works at the desk.

			CLIFTON
				(into the phone)
		Darling, it's me, I'm sorry,
		something's come up.
				(Katharine responds)
		Don't sulk - I'll be back tomorrow
		evening.  I promise.
				(Katharine responds)
		Okay my precious, I love you.

Rupert makes a face at his friend's sentimentality.  Clifton beams.

			RUPERT
		I didn't know you were going anywhere?

			CLIFTON
		I'm not.  I'm going to surprise her.
		It's our anniversary.  She's forgotten,
		of course.  What's the symbol for your
		first anniversary?  I should get something.
		Is it paper?
				(he knocks sharply on the wall)
		Moose!  Moose, you there?  First
		Anniversary - is it cotton?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Is what cotton?

			CLIFTON
		First Wedding Anniversary.

			RUPERT
				(of Clifton)
		He's hopeless!

			CLIFTON
		Your day will come, my sausage.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Your first anniversary is Paper.


113	EXT.    CAIRO STREET.   O/S  SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.

The approach to the Shepheard's Hotel.  Geoffrey Clifton in a TAXI, 
champagne between his knees.

The car ahead of them SCREECHES TO A HALT as a WOMAN hurries across the 
street.  The driver honks his horn angrily.  The woman puts up a hand 
in apology as she skips across the street to another taxi.  IT'S 
KATHARINE - she's dressed for a date, carries flowers, an overnight 
bag.

Geoffrey, at first excited, is troubled by the accouterments.  Then he 
sees Katharine skip and his whole being punctures.

Katharine's cab roars off.  His own car jerks forward.

			CLIFTON
		Stop!

			CABBIE
		Please?

			CLIFTON
		Stop here.

			CABBIE
		Yessir.

Geoffrey sits in the cab.  Fifty yards short of the hotel.  The world 
rushes by.  He finds a cigarette.


114	INT.    ALMÁSY'S ROOMS.    LATE DAY.

Katharine is in bed.  Almásy has just put A RECORD on.  It's the folk 
song heard at the beginning of the film.  He slips back under the 
covers.  Their clothes are scattered around the room.  He lies over a 
happy Katharine.  She listens.

			KATHARINE
		This is - what is this?

			ALMÁSY
		It's a folk song.

			KATHARINE
		Arabic?

			ALMÁSY
		No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka
		sang it to me.

			KATHARINE
				(as they listen)
		It's beautiful.  What's it about?

			ALMÁSY
				(as if interpreting)
		It's a long song - Szerelem means 
		love...and the story - there's a
		Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer,
		a fool.  For years he's on some kind
		of quest, who knows what?  And then
		one day he falls under the spell of a
		mysterious English woman - a
		harpy - who beats him and hits him
		and he becomes her slave.  He sews
		her clothes, he worships the hem of -

Katharine had thought for a few seconds he was serious, then she 
catches on and starts to beat him.

			ALMÁSY
				(laughing)
		Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!

			KATHARINE
		You bastard, I was believing you!

They embrace, he lies over her, considering her naked back.

			ALMÁSY
		I claim this shoulder blade - oh no,
		wait - I want this!

He turns her over, kisses her throat, then traces the hollow 
indentation.

			ALMÁSY
		This - what's it called? - this place,
		I love it - this is mine!
				(Katharine doesn't know)
		I'm asking the King permission to
		call it the Almasy Bosphorous.

			KATHARINE
				(teasing)
		I thought we were against ownership?
				(kissing him)
		I can stay tonight.

The luxury of this makes them both sad.  The duplicity.  Almásy rolls 
away on to his back.

			ALMÁSY
		Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to
		warn me.  He keeps talking about
		Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea
		of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea
		of a man-to-man chat.

			KATHARINE
		This is a different world - is what
		I tell myself.  A different life.
		And here I am a different wife.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  A different wife.


115	INT. CAB.  CAIRO STREET.  O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.  NIGHT.

The CAB DRIVER is asleep. A loud POP! jerks him awake.  In the back of 
the car Geoffrey has opened the champagne.  He lets it overflow, then 
takes a swig.  He notices the startled driver and puts up an apologetic 
arm.

			CLIFTON
		Sorry.

Two or three CHILDREN knock on the window, begging.  Geoffrey knocks 
back, violently.  They disappear.

			CABBIE
		Hotel now, sir?

			GEOFFREY
		No.

And he throws a silencing wad of money onto the seat by the Cabbie.


116	EXT.    ALMASY'S HOUSE.    OLD CAIRO.    DAWN.

Almásy and Katharine wander out of his building and into the early 
morning streets, hand in hand.


117	EXT.    SPICE MARKET.    CAIRO.    DAWN.

The MORNING PRAYERS rise out from the city's three Minarets.  Almásy 
stops at a stall, which is just preparing to open for the day.  He 
picks up a SILVER THIMBLE, points at it to the merchant who gives him a 
price.  Without comment, Almásy produces the money and, beaming, hands 
the thimble to Katharine.

			ALMÁSY
		I don't care to bargain.
				(she smiles)
		It's full of saffron, just in case
		you think I'm giving it to you to
		encourage your sewing.

			KATHARINE
		That day, had you followed me
		to the market?

			ALMÁSY
		Of course.  You didn't need to slap
		my face to make me feel as if you'd
		slapped my face.

			KATHARINE
				(loving him, but frightened)
		Shall we be all right?

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  Yes.
				(shrugs)
		Absolutely.


118	EXT.    CAIRO STREET.    DAWN.

Katharine takes leave of Almásy on the street corner away from the 
hotel entrance.  They don't kiss, there's no demonstration of feeling.  
He turns immediately away and disappears.


119	INT.  CAB.  CAIRO STREET.  O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.  DAY.

Geoffrey, unshaven, watches as Katharine crosses the street and heads 
towards the hotel.  His expression is terrible, trying to smile, his 
face collapsed.


120	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Cheek to Cheek leaks into the room from a GRAMOPHONE that Caravaggio 
stands over proudly.  The Patient opens his eyes - is confused, 
dislocated - stares blankly at Caravaggio.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(grinning)
		Thought you'd never wake up!

			THE PATIENT
		What?

Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.

			HANA
		Where did you find that?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I liberated it.

			HANA
		I think that's called looting.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(relaxed)
		No-one should own music.  The real
		question is who wrote the song?

			THE PATIENT
		Irving Berlin.

			CARAVAGGIO
		For?

			THE PATIENT
		Top Hat.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Is there a song you don't know?

			HANA
				(speaking for him)
		No.  He sings all the time.

She goes over to the Patient and kisses him gently.

			HANA
		Good morning.
				(of his singing)
		Did you know that?  You're always singing?

			THE PATIENT
		I've been told that before.

			HANA
		Kip's another one.

She goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are pitched, sees 
Hardy shaving, Kip IN THE PROCESS OF WASHING HIS HAIR, his turban 
HANGING LIKE A RIBBON between two trees to dry.  He's perched a bowl on 
the sundial and is dipping his long coal-black hair into it.  As Hana 
watches Kip, Caravaggio changes the record.  The Patient identifies it 
immediately.


121*.	EXT.    MONASTERY GARDEN.     MORNING.

Hana walks past the tent, and passes Hardy.  She's carrying a small 
cup, which she's a little furtive about.  He's carrying a whole armada 
of OIL LIGHTS.  He nods upstairs.

			HANA
		Hello.

			HARDY
		Hello miss.

			HANA
		I was going to say - if you want to
		eat with us, ever... you and Lieutenant
		Singh...

			HARDY
		Very kind of you, we can always eat in
		the town with the others -

			HANA
		Since Caravaggio turned up - food
		seems to appear, so please.

			HARDY
		I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.

			HANA
		You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.
				(Hardy waves that away)
		I thought you were very very tall.  You
		seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt
		like a child who can't keep her balance.

			HARDY
				(does a little mime)
		A toddler

She goes on, and tentatively approaches Kip, who's still working at his 
hair.  Kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm, moving towards her 
like a blink man through the curtain of hair.  He touches her.

			HANA
		Sorry, is it all right I'm seeing this?

Kip shrugs.

			HANA
		My hair was long.  At some point.  
		I've forgotten what a nuisance it is
		to wash.  You know - if you were ever
		around - we get water from the pump
		at noon.

He continues to wash.  She holds up the cup of oil.

			HANA
		Try this.  I found a great jar of it.  
		Olive oil.  In Naples this was so
		precious it would have bought you a wife.

			KIP
		Thank you.

She stands for a second, then walks away.  Kip examines the oil, calls 
after her.

			KIP
		For my hair?

			HANA
				(turning, smiling)
		Yes, for your hair.


122	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA IS GARDENING, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-fledged 
Scarecrow.  Broken bottles, fragments of stained glass and shards from 
a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes too, all jangling and 
tinkling and catching the sunlight.

Kip and Hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles.  She watches 
them, catching Kip's careless wave to her.  She looks briefly at 
herself in A PIECE OF MIRROR dangling from the Scarecrow.


123	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    UPSTAIRS LANDING.    DAY.

Hana walks along the landing with a tray.  There's a message on several 
doors in the corridor from Kip: SAFE, then a couple with the warning: 
DANGER.  She hears noise from the Patient's room.  Listens for a second 
before going in.

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		Because you're reading it too fast!

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		Not at all.

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		You have to read Kipling slowly!
		Your eye is too impatient - think
		about the speed of his pen.
				(quoting Kipling to demonstrate)
		What is it - He sat comma in defiance
		of municipal orders comma astride the
		gun Zamzammah on her brick... What is it?


124	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

During this, Hana comes through with the tray, finds Kip perched on the 
window, relishing his skirmish with the Patient, who has condensed milk 
dribbling down his neck.

			KIP
		Brick platform opposite the old
		Ajaib-Gher -

			THE PATIENT
		#NAME?
		natives called the Lahore Museum.

			KIP
		It's still there, the cannon, outside the
		museum.  It was made of metal cups
		and bowls taken from every household
		in the city as tax, then melted down.
		Then later they fired the cannon at my
		people - comma - The natives.

			THE PATIENT
		So what do you really object to - the
		writer or what he's writing about?

			KIP
		What I really object to, Uncle, is
		your finishing all my condensed milk.
				(snatching up the empty can)
		And the message everywhere in your
		book - however slowly I read it - that
		the best destiny for India is to be ruled
		by the British.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana, we have discovered a shared
		please - the boy and I.

			HANA
		Arguing about books.

			THE PATIENT
		Condensed milk - one of the truly
		great inventions.

			KIP
				(grinning, leaving)
		I'll get another tin.

Hana and the Patient are alone.

			HANA
		I didn't like that book either.  It's
		all about men.  Too many men.
		Just like this house.

			THE PATIENT
		You like him, don't you?  Your
		voice changes.

			HANA
		I don't think it does.
				(a beat)
		Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

			THE PATIENT
		I don't think it's indifference.

Kip comes bounding in with a fresh can.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana was just telling me that you
		were indifferent -

			HANA
				(appalled)
		Hey! - 

			THE PATIENT
		#NAME?

			KIP
		Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not
		Hana's cooking in particular.
				(stabbing at the tin with a bayonet)
		Have either of you ever tried 
		condensed milk sandwiches?


125	DELETED.


126.				INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.   MORNING.

Caravaggio and the Patient are singing - an Arab song which they both 
know from Cairo days.  THUNDER accompanies them.  It's pouring.  
Suddenly the door is flung open and HANA, KIP and HARDY appear.  They 
have the stretcher with them.


127*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    MORNING.

A whoop precedes THE HEADLONG RUSH OF KIP, HARDLY and CARAVAGGIO as 
they cart the Patient across the Cloisters like manic stretcher-
bearers.  Hana is with them, holding an umbrella over the Patient who 
bounces uncomfortably.  He is nervous, a little giddy.  The rain 
buckets down.

			THE PATIENT
				(no irony)
		Careful - careful!


127a*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    MORNING.

The storm tour includes a trip around the pond.  The Patient pushes 
away the umbrella, lets the rain drench him.   He grins at Hana.

			THE PATIENT
		This is wonderful!

			KIP
				(to Hana)
		What's he saying?

			HANA
		He's saying it's wonderful!


128*.	INT.  LIBRARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EGYPTOLOGY.  DAY.

Madox and Almásy are camped in one corner of THE LIBRARY, hunched over 
their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site 
of the next part of the expedition.

			MADOX
				(pushing away his charts)
		And I'm telling you there's nothing
		there to explore.

			ALMÁSY
		No, because you can't see from the air!
		If you could explore from the air life
		would be very simple!
				(he yanks up a map)
		Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi?
		That whole spur is a real possibility...

			MADOX
		Which we've overflown twice.

			ALMÁSY
		Which we couldn't explore because
		of rocks, because of cross-winds,
		it's sloppy.
				(stabbing another location)
		And here - and here - we could be
		staring at Zerzura.

	Other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish.

			MADOX
		So - on Thursday you don't trust
		Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell
		couldn't draw a map, but on Friday
		he's suddenly infallible?

Almásy is surprised by Madox' anger.

			MADOX
		And where are the Expedition Maps?

			ALMÁSY
		In my room.

			MADOX
		Those maps belong to His Majesty's
		Government.  They're confidential.
		They shouldn't be left lying around
		for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have
		sight of.

			ALMÁSY
		What's the matter with you?

			MADOX
		Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know
		there's a war breaking out.
				(he tosses a slip of paper onto
the map, recites its message)
		This arrived this morning.  By order
		of the British Government - all
		International Expeditions to be
		aborted by May 1939.


129	INT.   CAIRO STREET.   DAY.

Almásy and Madox walk down this busy and rather narrow street without 
pavements.  Both of them somber.

			ALMÁSY
		Why do they care about our maps?

			MADOX
		What do we find in the desert?  Arrow
		heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the
		desert, you own North Africa.

			ALMÁSY
				(contemptuous)
		Own the desert.

Almásy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take leave of Madox.

			ALMÁSY
		That place at the base of a woman's
		throat?  You know - the hollow - here -
		does that have an official name?

Madox looks at him.

			MADOX
		For God's sake, man - pull
		yourself together.


130	INT.    OPEN-AIR CINEMA.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

The OPEN-AIR CINEMA is just beginning its evening programme.

PATHE NEWS BEGINS and we date the event to April 1939.  Stories of 
imminent war jostle with images of Merrie England.  Village greens, 
sporting victories, Cruft's Dog Show.  Alone among the necking couples 
- mostly soldiers with their Egyptian girlfriends - in an otherwise 
empty block, is Katharine.  She's waiting for Almásy.  A SOLDIER comes 
over to Katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her.

			SOLDIER
		Beggin your pardon, miss, but have
		you got a lighter?

Katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen.  An item 
about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and TOP HAT.  The stars do their 
stuff.  The soldier moves a seat nearer.

			SOLDIER
				(leering)
		I love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?

			KATHARINE
		Fuck off.

			SOLDIER
		What?

			KATHARINE
		You heard me.

The Soldier slinks off, muttering.  Katharine is wretched.  She sits 
head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about 
duplicity, sordid assignations.

Almásy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily 
large across the screen.

			ALMÁSY
		Sorry.

They watch the screen.  Katharine is weeping.  Almásy doesn't 
understand.  He puts his arm around her.

			KATHARINE
		I can't do this, I can't do this any more.


131*.	EXT.    GROPPI PARK.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

A man walks round with A HAND BELL - announcing that the Park is 
closing.  He turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages.  
Almásy and Katharine sit stiffly on a bench.  They don't speak.  Almásy 
puts his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders.  The lights are 
gradually being extinguished around them.

	Finally, Katharine gets up.

			KATHARINE
		I'd better get back.
				(she keeps him away with a hand)
		Say goodbye here.

			ALMÁSY
		I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm
		agreeing, because I'm not.

They stand, awkward.  Katharine rehearses her position.  The bell 
clangs.

			KATHARINE
		I just know - any minute he'll find out,
		we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it
		will ill him.

			ALMÁSY
		Don't go over it again, please.

He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them, then releases them, gets 
up, walks away.  She walks towards the gate.  He calls after her.

			ALMÁSY
		Katharine -

	He walks towards her, his smile awful.

			ALMÁSY
		I just wanted you to know.
		I'm not missing you yet.

She nods, can't find this funny.

			KATHARINE
		You will.  You will.

Then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the 
gatepost, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries away.


132*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Hana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against the 
morning light.  His breathing is noticeably worsening, a shudder of a 
breath, the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible.  Hana 
frets, touches his wrist, feeling for the pulse.

			THE PATIENT
		I'm still here.

			HANA
		You'd better be.

			THE PATIENT
		Don't depend on it.  Will you?
		That little bit of air, each day
		there's less of it, which is al right,
		which is quite all right.

She squeezes his hand, suddenly overwhelmed.

			THE PATIENT
				(brightly)
		I've been talking to Caravaggio - my
		research assistant - there's meant to be
		a ghost in the Cloisters.  I can join him!

There's some kind of noise from the garden.  Muffled shouts.

			THE PATIENT
		It's the boy.

Hana goes to the window, opens the shutters.  The day pours in.


132A*.	EXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.

Hana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at the far perimeter of the 
garden in the olive groves, HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIM, HIS LEG HELD 
OUT STRANGELY.  WIRES run from his foot in all directions as if he'd 
trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb.


133	EXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.

Hana appears at the edge of the Olive groves and hurries towards Kip, 
who hasn't moved.  He shouts warning her.

			KIP
		Go to the left!  Keep to the left!  There
		are mines and trip wires everywhere!

Hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long 
grass.  He shouts, doesn't want her close.

			KIP
		Get Hardy.  He's on the other side of 
		town.  In the hills.  Get him to hurry.

She keeps coming, can see that he needs her.

			HANA
		It's okay - I'll help.  Please.

			KIP
		The mines, the wires, there's a trick.
		Some explode if you stretch the wires,
		some if you cut them.

			HANA
		What do I do?

			KIP
		There's a mine here, but the others are
		far enough away, I think at least to
		give me a chance.  I have to work out
		which one to cut before I fall over.

			HANA
		So I follow the wires?

			KIP
		You get Hardy.

			HANA
		I follow the wires.

She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.

			KIP
		Don't touch them.

She follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back 
to Kip's foot.  Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine 
some thirty metres away.

			HANA
		Why would anyone do this?

			KIP
		I've done this.  I've had to do this.

	Then Hana's suddenly tense.

			HANA
		Give me a second.

She turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER AREA, straight to what 
had seized her attention.  Kip is appalled.

			KIP
		What are you doing?!  Hana!

Heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as THE 
TORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, ANOTHER 
CONCRETE-COVERED MINE.

Hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal.  She turns, 
holding the protesting animal in triumph.  HER FOOT SNAGS ON A WIRE.  
She has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise.   
She goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal.  Then 
she's back with Kip.  He's seething.  She is strangely elated.

			KIP
		What is this business with you and
		explosives?  Do you think you're immune?

			HANA
		I promise you that was the right thing
		to do.  He's my good luck.
				(she gets the pliers from his belt,
and hands them to him)
		Now cut.  This one.
				(she indicates the wire)
		I hope we don't die.

			KIP
		Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.

			HANA
		I'm not scared.  So many people have
		died around me.  But I would be a
		shame for us.
				(shrugs)
		I don't feel like being shy.

			KIP
		You must get away.  Before I cut.  I'm
		not cutting if you're here.

He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.

			HANA
		Actually, you can't cut, can you?
		You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.

			KIP
		No.

But he hands them over.

			HANA
		Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.


			KIP
		Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and
		then cut.

Hana checks, lies down.  He bends as close to the ground as he dares 
AND KISSES HER, THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS.


134	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    CONTINUOUS.

The Patient lies in bed.  He's agitated by the silence.  SUDDENLY 
THERE'S AN EXPLOSION.  He tries to shout, a croak which quickly reduces 
him to coughing and breathlessness.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana!  Hana!  Kip!  Hana!

He tries to move.  He can't.  He's frantic.

FOOTSTEPS, as someone hurtles up the stairs.  It's Hana.  She's ashamed 
to have forgotten him.  She rushes to him.

			HANA
		I'm sorry.  I forgot you'd be worrying.
		We're all safe.  It was a mine, but not
		the mine.  Nobody's hurt.  I'm sorry.

She calms him.  He's exhausted.  His eyes shine.


135	EXT.    MOUNTAIN ROAD.    ITALY.    LATE DAY.

Hana clings onto Kip as the TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE hares along the circling 
road.  She has her arms around his waist.  His head turns to her for a 
second and she smiles.

136	EXT.    ROAD BLOCK.    TUSCANY.    DUSK.

Kip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD BLOCK.  Kip is being 
questioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and 
accompanied by several meaningful glances at Hana, who waits, standing 
by the motorcycle.  One of the SOLDIERS saunters over and returns her 
papers.

			SOLDIER
		And you're definitely traveling with
		him of your own free will?

			HANA
		Yes.

			SOLDIER
				(clearly disapproving)
		Just wanting to be sure.  And he's
		taking you to church?

			HANA
				(deadpan)
		Yes.  We're going to a funeral.  A cow has
		died.  And in his religion they're sacred.

The Soldier isn't sure what to make of this.  He signals to his 
companion who returns Kip's papers.  Kip walks back to the motorcycles.  
He says nothing.  He kicks the starter.  Hana gets on, slides her arms 
lovingly around him.


137	EXT.    BRIDGE.    ITALY.    DUSK.

IT'S GETTING DARK.  The bike, headlights on, crosses a bridge.  Kip has 
strapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding 
crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down Italy.


138	EXT.    AREZZO.   DUSK.

	Kip steers the motorbike into the deserted PIAZZA.

They dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload 
the panniers.  Hana still doesn't know what's in store and looks 
questioningly at Kip as he walks up to the door of the CHURCH.


139	INT.    CHURCH.    DUSK.

They enter the Church.  It's in almost total darkness.  THEN A FLARE 
SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR.  It's magnificent.  Kip holds the 
flare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other.  Hana walks 
behind him, still perplexed.  There is PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING 
EVERYWHERE, AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND THE ALTARS, AND THE 
STATUES.

A SECOND FLARE.  Kip has appeared through A SECRET DOOR high in the 
church, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are 
momentarily visible.  He flings a rope over the rafters.

Now Kip circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and 
shoulder.  He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before 
disappearing.

Hana stands holding the flare.  She can't see Kip, can only hear him 
scrambling.

			HANA
		Kip?

He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters.  He collects the 
other end of the rope which is attached to Hana.  Holding onto it, he 
just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.

SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing 
around the Church.  Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through 
space, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted 
by Piero Della Francesca.  Hana's flare makes a halo around her head.

Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and 
causes Hana to SWING to the right.  She lets out a giddy laugh, 
exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - 
faces, bodies, angels.  Kip guides the rope as if they were making 
love, which in a way they are.

Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO 
SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed.  She reaches out to touch the giant neck of 
the sad Queen.

Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope.  Hana's 
face is full of tears.  He smiles, holds her.


140	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio is with the Patient.  He sits in the window.  Fiddles with 
the bandages of his hands.

			THE PATIENT
		There was a general who wore a patch
		over a perfectly good eye.  The men 
		fought harder for him.  Sometimes I
		think I could get up and dance. 
		What's under your bandages?

Caravaggio goes to him, holding out his hands, the bandage ends 
trailing.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hold the ends.

The Patient holds them.  Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages 
unraveling and unraveling.  


141*.	INT.  TOBRUK.  BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.  JUNE 1942.  DAY.

Caravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit, walks 
through the mangled corridors of British HQ.  Smoke is rising from 
buildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers in the distance as 
the harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions.  TOBRUK IS UNDER 
SIEGE.  BHQ is a place in the throws of dismantling itself.  
SECRETARIES are visiting braziers manned by ARAB BOYS who stoke the 
fires as boxes of papers are fed into them.  ASHES hover in the air.


142*.	INT.   BHQ.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

Caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks.  From one of 
them, a young woman, AICHA, kisses him, frowning at the chaos and the 
shelling.

			AICHA
		He's waiting for you.

Some doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently 
SHREDDING DOCUMENTS.  Caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar 
and where the incumbent, FENELON-BARNES, is stripping the room of his 
personal possessions-  photographs, stone branches, a cricket bat.


142a*.	INT.   FENELON-BARNES OFFICE.   BHQ.   TOBRUK.   DAY.

Caravaggio enters.

			FENELON-BARNES
				(barely looking up)
		What a bloody flap, eh?  I heard from
		Alexandria this morning - apparently
		no-one there is accepting British pounds.
		And if you pick up a telephone 
		everybody's practicing their German.
				(holds up some gramophone records)
		What do you do - do you take these
		things?
				(then, awkward)
		Look, Moose, we need you to stay in
		Tobruk.  A bit of a short straw but
		the thinking is we'll be back - I mean,
		we will be back - but...and in the
		interim we need eyes and ears on
		the ground.

A BIG BOMB lands nearby.  The building shudders and plaster dust drops 
from the ceiling.  Almost oblivious, the two men head out of the 
office.  Fenelon-Barnes lugs the TRUNK last glimpsed in his tent by 
Almásy, until Caravaggio takes over.


143*.	INT. CORRIDOR OF BRITISH HEADQUARTERS. TOBRUK. DAY.

Fenelon-Barnes and Caravaggio make their way down the stairs and to the 
entrance.

			CARAVAGGIO
		We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk.
		What are they going to be doing?

			FENELON-BARNES
				(continuing to pack)
		Giving Rommel a bloody nose. That's
		my suggestion.  But did you hear
		the BBC last nigh?  Tobruk is of no
		strategic importance - makes you wonder.

AICHA is at the bottom of the stairs.  She falls into step.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Jerry's got our maps you know.  Swines.
		Before the war we helped them run about
		the desert making maps - and now they
		get spies into Cairo using our maps, they'll
		get Rommel into Cairo using our maps.
		The whole of the desert like a bus route
		and we gave it to them.   Any foreigner who
		turned up - welcome to the Royal Geographic,
		take our maps.  Madox went mad, you know -
		you knew Peter Madox? - after he found

		Absolutely destroyed the poor sod.  Shot

Caravaggio opens the door, Fenelon-Barnes goes through.


144*.	EXT.    BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

The Fenelon-Barnes trunk is taken from Caravaggio and joins the pile of 
luggage and artifacts, which wait to be shipped out.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'd like to get that bastard Almásy -
		settle the score, eh?  That's my
		fantasy - said he, clearing out.
		Must have been a spy all along.


145	DELETED.


146*.	EXT.    TOBRUK DOCKSIDE.    DAY.

A GERMAN TROOP CARRIER rumbles forward passing a line of BEDRAGGLED 
BRITISH POWS as they're marched along the side of harbor.


146a*. EXT.    TOBRUK RUINED QUARTER.    DAY.

A HILL OF SALVAGED ARMY BOOTS is being explored by a couple of GERMAN 
SOLDIERS in search of better footwear.  Below them the POWS trudge by, 
one of them barefoot.  ONE OF THE GERMANS tosses down a pair of boots 
then continues his own perusal.


146b*. EXT.    TOBRUK SQUARE.    DAY.

A crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the MOSTLY ARAB 
FACES.  Their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting 
at open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO.  AN 
ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her 
ominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD.  An INTERPRETER mediates.  The 
OFFICER doesn't believe the woman.  She's getting frantic at the 
possibility of losing her child.

Suddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by 
her hair.  She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to 
recognize her as the pretty AICHA.  She touches a couple of people in 
the line.  They're horrified.  Soldiers pull them away.  Caravaggio 
doesn't look, stares straight ahead.  An officer watches him AS HE 
TURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER.  THEIR EYES CATCH 
FOR AN INSTANT AND THE OFFICER SEES IT.

CARAVAGGIO RUNS, bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one 
corner of the square.  The CONGREGATION throws itself to the ground 
until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man.


146c*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   INTERIOR OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

Shots pursue Caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble, then bobs 
up again as he darts inside a blasted building.  He clambers up some 
ruined stairs, heaves over the wall.


146d*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   FACADE OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

CARAVAGGIO grabs a metal bar on the facade of the building, from which 
he hangs, looking for the next foothold.  Soldiers appear along the top 
of the building, shouting, rifles ready.  AN OFFICER arrives and stops 
the soldiers firing, and the others begin to laugh as Caravaggio hangs 
from the bar fifteen feet above a balcony, slowly losing his strength.  
Another SOLDIER waits for him in the balcony below.  Now he starts to 
laugh.  Caravaggio hangs.


147*.	INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. TOBRUK. NOVEMBER 13,1942. DAY.

Caravaggio is slumped at a table, HIS HANDS MANACLED TO ITS THICK 
WOODEN LEGS.  There's A TELEPHONE at another table in the corner of the 
room attended by a CLERK with A STENOGRAPHER working next to him.  The 
room has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows.  SOLDIERS stand 
guard at the door.  It's a horrible room.  Caravaggio is trying to 
sleep, he's unshaven, and pasty-looking.  His interrogator, Müller, 
seems incredibly tired and aggravated.  He's on the phone.

			MÜLLER
				(in German)
		Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

He slams down the phone and comes back to the table.

			MÜLLER
		David Caravaggio.

			CARAVAGGIO
		No.

			MÜLLER
		Petty thief, six months imprisonment
		Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(barely with humor)
		I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong
		man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio
		Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both
		painters, I think that is confusing you.

Müller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file.  Pulls 
out some photographs, starts spreading them out.

			MÜLLER
		Is this you?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I don't know.

			MÜLLER
		It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at
		British Headquarters - July 41.  And so was
		this - August 41.  And this -February 42.

			CARAVAGGIO
		It's impossible.  I was buying or selling
		something.  I've been to Cairo many times.

			MÜLLER
		You are a Canadian spy working for
		the Allies.  Code-name Moose.

THE PHONE rings again, is answered.  The Clerk calls to Müller who gets 
up, irritably.  Caravaggio addresses the room.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Could I have a doctor?  I am passing
		blood.  I must be bleeding internally.
				(to the clerk)
		Can you get a doctor?  Look -
				(he spits onto the table,
there's blood in his mouth)
		I'm leaking blood.
				(he indicates a Guard)
		He kicks me.  He kicks me all the time.

Nobody responds.  Müller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, 
negotiating time.  The call finishes.

			CLERK
				(in German)
		He's asking for a doctor.

			MÜLLER
				(to Caravaggio)
		You want a doctor?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a 
		month, I don't know, also my leg was -

			MÜLLER
		We don't have a doctor, but we
		do have a nurse.

			CARAVAGGIO
		A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great.
		A nurse?  Great.

Müller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up.  Just then the 
telephone rings again.  He hesitates.

			MÜLLER
				(in German)
		Leave it and get the nurse!

The Clerk exits.  The phone rings.  The Stenographer is plagued by 
flies.  Suddenly he slaps at one.

			MÜLLER
				(snapping)
		Why is there so much nose?  I can't
		hear myself think!
				(turns to Caravaggio)
		Look - give me something.  So we can
		all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.
				(wiping his face)
		It's too hot.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife
		in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points
		at you, you only see trouble.

The NURSE comes in.  She is Arab and her head is covered.

			MÜLLER
		I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  This
		is your nurse, by the way.  She's Moslem,
		so she'll understand all of this.  What's
		the punishment for adultery?  Let's
		leave it at that.  You're married and 
		you were fucking another woman, so
		that's - is it the hands that are cut off?
		Or is that for stealing?  Does anyone know?

There's silence.  Müller turns to Caravaggio.

			MÜLLER
		Well, you must know.  You were 
		brought up Libya, yes?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Don't cut me.

			MÜLLER
		Or was it Toronto?

			CARAVAGGIO
				(ashen)
		Don't cut me.  Come on.

Now the phone starts again.  The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse 
exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to 
interrupt Müller.

			MÜLLER
		Ten fingers.  How about this?  You
		give me a name for every finger -
		doesn't matter who.  I get something,
		you keep something.  I'm trying to be
		reasonable.  Fenelon-Barnes, we could 
		call that two names.
				(pauses, suddenly puzzled)
		Are thumbs fingers?
				(in GERMAN to the others)
		Is a thumb a finger?

No response.  Müller opens his palms to Caravaggio.

			MÜLLER
		I get no help from these people.

			CLERK
				(in German)
		The telephone -

Müller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down.  an AIR RAID 
SIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is 
also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack-
clack of the STENOGRAPHER.  At that moment, Müller suddenly becomes 
aware of what is happening.  He turns on the Stenographer.

			MÜLLER
				(in German)
		What are you doing?

			STENOGRAPHER
				(awkward, in German)
		That Geneva Convention.  I'm -

	Müller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.

			CARAVAGGIO
		You can't do that!  Hey - come on!

DURING THIS Müller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and 
produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR.  He hands it to the nurse, makes a line 
across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio.  The 
nurse is extremely reluctant.  Müller claps his hands, pushes her 
towards Caravaggio.

			MÜLLER
		Go!  Hey!  Go!

Caravaggio is in terror.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.

The guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's 
shoulders to prevent him from moving.  The nurse, grim-faced, 
approaches, kneels at the table. 

			CARAVAGGIO
				(as she prepares to cut)
		Listen, I'll give you a name.  What
		name did you say?  I knew them!
		I promise.  Please - please!

And then he SCREAMS AND SCREAMS and jerks up, carrying the guards and 
the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off 
balance.  He falls to the floor, ROARING WITH PAIN, blood everywhere, 
the table on top of him.  The AIR RAID is continuing outside, the PHONE 
IS RINGING, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.

			MÜLLER
		Cut the other thumb.

He stabs at his own right thumb.

			MÜLLER
		This one!  Come on!

The nurse, horrified, shakes her head.  Müller snatches the razor from 
her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio.

One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in 
half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Müller approaches.  
Caravaggio can't move.  He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles 
him.  His eyes are streaming with tears.

Now Müller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts 
Caravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his 
mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of 
the table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his 
knees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.


148	INT.    INTERROGATION ROOM.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

LATER, and Caravaggio comes round.  His eyes open and then his face 
spasms with pain.  He looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes 
he's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the 
table on its side.  He gets up and staggers out of the open door and up 
the stairs.


149*.	INT.  STAIRS FROM INTERROGATION ROOM.  TOBRUK.   DAY.
 
The corridor is deserted, but the body of a GERMAN SOLDIER sprawls on 
the stairs leading up to daylight.  Outside Caravaggio can hear 
fighting.


150*.	EXT.    ROOF.    INTERROGATION BUILDING.    DAY.

Caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building.  Grey and 
yellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire 
accompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people 
shouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening.

SUDDENLY A PARACHUTE FLOATS DOWN BY HIM.  THEN ANOTHER.  THEN ANOTHER.  
HE'S SURROUNDED BY PARACHUTES.  THE BRITISH ARE RECLAIMING TOBRUK.  A 
PARATROOPER LANDS ON THE ROOF, AND GESTURES TO CARAVAGGIO TO RAISE HIS 
HANDS.  HE SLOWLY DOES SO.


151*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Caravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his NAKED HANDS to 
the Patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his 
thumbs were.  The Patient reaches out to take his hands and gently 
lowers them.  Caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back 
round his fists.

			CARAVAGGIO
		The man who took my thumbs, I found
		him eventually - he's dead.  The man who
		took my photograph, I found him too -
		that took me a year.  He's dead.  Another
		man took that man across the desert to
		Cairo.  Now I intend to find him.

The LIGHTS FROM THE MOTORBIKE approaching the Monastery, its growl.  
Caravaggio goes to the window and watches as Kip and Hana arrive.


152	INT.   AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.   CAIRO, 1939.   NIGHT.

Last seen at the Troops Christmas party, the INNER COURTYARD has been 
transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. The 
Almásy/Madox team is assembled for A FAREWELL DINNER.  They are waiting 
for Almásy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty.  He is very late.  
And then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing.  He practically 
dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position 
opposite Katharine.  He bows to Lady Hampton.

			ALMÁSY
		I believe I'm rather late.

			MADOX
				(ignoring the drama of this entrance)
		Good, we're all here?  A toast,
		to the International Sand club -
		may it soon resurface.

			THE OTHERS
		The International Sand Club!

			ALMÁSY
				(raising his glass)
		Misfits, buggers, fascists, and
		paedophiles.  God bless us every one.

The others drink, trying to ignore his mood.

			ALMÁSY
		Oops!  Mustn't say International.  
		Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty!
		Die Führer!  Il Duce.

			CLIFTON
		Sorry, what's your point?

			ALMÁSY
				(ignoring the remark)
		And the people here don't want us.
		Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are
		desperate to get rid of the Colonials...
				(to an embarrassed Fouad)
		- isn't that right?  Their best people
		get down on hands and knees 
		begging to be spared a knighthood.
				(to his host, Sir Hampton)
		Isn't that right?

Ronnie Hampton shrugs.  They're all very uncomfortable.  Almásy glares 
at Clifton.

			ALMÁSY
		What's my point?
				(standing up)
		Oh!  I've invented a new dance - the
		Bosphorus Hug.  Anybody up to it?
		Madox?  D'Ag?  Come on D'Aggers.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Let's eat first.  Sit down.

The Band is now playing Manhattan - Almásy, without missing a beat, 
begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows.  He 
lurches around.  Katharine can't look at him.

			ALMÁSY
		...We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish
		we'll frighten when we're in.  your
		bathing suit so thin will make the
		shellfish grin, fin to fin. --  Those
		were the words - actually - before
		they were cleaned up.  Could be a
		song for you, Mrs. Clifton -
				(a perfect English accent)
		#NAME?

Madox gets up and pulls Almásy into his chair, taking charge.

			MADOX
		Look, either shut up, or go home.

			ALMÁSY 
				(darkly)
		Absolutely right, shut up.  Lashings of
		apologies all round.


153*.	EXT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.

Later, now MOST OF THE GROUP ARE DANCING.  We see Katharine dancing 
with Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself.  Bermann is there and even Madox 
jogging and grinning foolishly.  Clifton looks at Katharine who, as the 
dance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom.  Almásy hovers in 
the shadows, unseen.


154*.	INT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.

Katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is 
suddenly confronted by Almásy, tortured and out of control.

			ALMÁSY
		Why did you hold his collar?

			KATHARINE
		What?

			ALMÁSY
				(mimicking her inflection)
		What?  What?  That boy, that little boy,
		you were holding his collar, gripping
		his collar, what for?

			KATHARINE
		Would you let me pass?

			ALMÁSY
		Is he next?  Do you drag him into your
		little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?

			KATHARINE
		Don't do this.

			ALMÁSY
		I've watched you - on verandahs, at
		Garden Parties, at the Races - how
		can you stand there?  How can you
		ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?

			KATHARINE
		You know why?

He tries to hold her.  She resists

			ALMÁSY
		Dance with me.

			KATHARINE
		No.

			ALMÁSY
		Dance with me.  I want to touch you.
		I want the things which are mine.
		Which belong to me.

			KATHARINE
		Do you think you're the only one who
		feels anything?  Is that what you think?

Some women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the 
Ladies Room.  They collect Katharine in their train and leave Almásy to 
fall back into the shadows.


155	INT.    THE PATIENTS' ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana sits with the Patient.  His eyes are full of tears.  He opens 
them, sees her, watching over him.  He's embarrassed.

			THE PATIENT
		Why don't you go?
				(wiping his eyes)
		You should sleep.

			HANA
		Would you like me to?

He nods.  She gets up, touches his hand, then leaves.


156*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY, LANDING AND STAIRS.    NIGHT.

Hana leaves the room, then turns and sees A TINY LAMP on the floor, 
it's made from a SNAIL SHELL and oil.  She bends to it curiously, then 
sees a second lamp half-way down the stairs, then a third further down.  
She smiles in the light, then follows the trail.


157	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.


In the Cloisters THE TRAIL OF SHELL LAMPS CONTINUES, like tiny cat's 
eyes.  As they reach the hopscotch chalk marks, they outline the 
squares.  Hana HOPSCOTCHES and then follows the light, disappearing 
round a corner.



158	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    NIGHT.

Hana comes through into the stables.  The lamps lead her, then they 
stop.  She peers into the shadows.

			KIP (O/S)
		Hana.

She turns to the voice.  He steps out of the darkness.

			HANA 
				(happy )
		Kip.

And he goes to her.


159	EXT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    EARLY MORNING.

Hardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables.  Eventually Hana 
opens the door.

			HARDY
		I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.

			HANA
		He's sleeping.

			HARDY
		Only we have to go to work.

			HANA
		I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?

			HARDY
		A bomb.  At the Viaduct.

She closes the door, then reappears.

			HANA
		Does he have to go?

			HARDY
		Pardon me?

			HANA
		What if you couldn't find him...?
				(Hardy's bewildered)
		Sergeant, not today, please.
		Not this morning.

Kip comes to the door, winding his turban.

			KIP
		What's happening?  Am I needed?

			HARDY
		I'm afraid so, sir.

Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.

			HANA
		Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love
		a coward, I can't love another dead man.

			KIP
		This is what I do.  I do this every day.

And he's ready, Hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles.  He gets on 
his, and they're away, Hana hardly able to look.


160	EXT.    A VIADUCT NORTH OF THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

KIP IS LOWERED BY A PULLEY INTO THE SHAFT THE SAPPERS HAVE MADE AROUND 
THE BOMB.  Hardy supervises.  The bombs huge - 2, 000 lbs, and 
protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a pool of 
sludge at the base of the viaduct.

Kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust.   
Warily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of the 
case.  He wipes the metal.  Reveals a serial number, calls it out to 
Hardy, who's perched on the bank.

			KIP
		Serial number - KK-1P2600.

He's hypnotized by the number: KK-1P: a bomb with his name on it.


161	EXT.    ROAD APPROACHING VIADUCT.   DAY.

Hana cycles along on Caravaggio's bicycle.  A TANK comes roaring up 
behind her, then a second and a third, loaded up with people, citizens 
and soldiers, and children, waving flags and gesticulating.  She lets 
the metal circus go by.


162	INT.    BOMB SHAFT.    DAY.

Back in the shaft, Kip works away, his fingers shaking with the cold 
from the oxygen he's using to freeze the fuse.  Suddenly there's a 
VIOLENT TREMOR.  The ground is SHUDDERING, and the bomb slips horribly.  
Kip GRABS AT IT helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling, 
instead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge.

			KIP
		Hardy!  Hardy!  What's happening?!


163	EXT.    VIADUCT.    DAY.

The TANKS are rumbling towards the Viaduct.  HORNS start sounding.  
HARDY, below, bellows at his men above for explanation.

			HARDY
		Corporal!?  Dade!!

			DADE
		Tanks, sir.  Don't know what it's about.
		God only knows.

			HARDY
				(incredulous)
		What is this - a bloody carnival?
		Stop them!

Three Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession.  
They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back wit their flags - 
Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks.  Now SHOTS are ringing out.  In the 
shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen 
spurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of 
the water.  Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety.

			HARDY
		You've got to cut, sir, that frost
		won't last.

			KIP
		Go away.

			HARDY
		Yessir.

			KIP
		This is making me incredibly angry.

He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips 
them through the tiny gap.  His hand touches the casing and the freeze 
BURNS his hand.  He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge, 
cursing.

Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to 
find the pliers.  Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help.  The seconds 
run out as Kip grovels in the mud.  Totally submerged, he suddenly 
comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and 
cuts.  There's a snip.  Then nothing.  Then Kip laughs at Hardy.

			KIP
		Kiss me.

Hardy is already at the winch, hauling it up.  Kip can hardly clip on 
the halter - his hands numb and burned.  As the pulley jerks he just 
clings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out 
of a bog.

The other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site.  Great 
elation on their faces.

			HARDY 
		Get a blanket!
				(not getting attention)
		Dade!  Get the Lieutenant a blanket.

			DADE
		It's over, Sarge.  It's over.  Jerry's surrendered.
				(to Kip)
		Sir, congratulations!

Kip shakes his hand.  Kip shakes Hardy's hand.

			KIP
		Congratulations.  

And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS 
FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory  celebrations begin.  Kip's 
blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around 
his shoulders.

HANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his 
blanket, the men celebrating.  She shouts with relief from the top of 
the bridge.

			HANA
		Kip!


164	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

	A VICTORY CELEBRATION PARTY.

The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra.  Kip sits in the window, the 
shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the 
music, sucking out of his condensed milk.  Elsewhere there is an open 
bottle of cognac, some wine.  The Patient has a beaker of wine.  
Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.

			HANA
		Kip - come and dance with me

			KIP
				(a sly wobble of the head)
		Yes.  Later.

Caravaggio swirls past the Patient - nodding at the cognac.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Have a drink.

			THE PATIENT
		I've had a drink.  Fatal.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Well, anything you do is likely 
		to be fatal, so you know -

			THE PATIENT
		Very true!


165	EXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    NIGHT.

A tiny PIAZZA where the Sappers and the Villagers are having their own, 
more raucous, Victory Feste.  There are accordions, there's dancing, 
and there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: 
DORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE FOUNTAIN.  He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to 
the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK 
FLAG he has in his mouth.

BLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant.  He's drunk and 
slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with 
a great splash, to much hilarity.  


166	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing.  The music has stopped.  
Caravaggio changes the record.  Hana goes to Kip for a second, beaming, 
before Caravaggio has snatched her away again.  The Patient taps along 
to the music.

			THE PATIENT
		Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?

			HANA
		Never heard of it.

			THE PATIENT
		That was a dance we invented at
		the International Sand Club.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(cryptic)
		What?  You and Madox?  Or you
		and Katharine Clifton?

			THE PATIENT
				(a small laugh)
		What?

There's a muddled thud in the distance, Kip's ears prick up.  He 
glances for an instant out of the window.

			HANA
				(anxious, of the noise)
		What was that?

She is spinning with Caravaggio.  When she comes round again, Kip has 
gone.


167	EXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    ITALY 1945.    NIGHT.

	Kip's motorbike skids into the tiny PIAZZA.

A MILITARY AMBULANCE IS ALREADY THERE.  Dade and SPALDING are presiding 
as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck.  The 
shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give 
some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the 
shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm.  ONE GIRL, young and quite 
striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the 
doors of the ambulance.

SPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know 
what happened.

			SPALDING
		Booby trap.  They was running up the
		Union Jack, sir, up off that statue -
		It just went off.

			DADE
		Should have been me.  It was my idea
		but Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir,
		him and Blackler.

Kip goes to the ambulance.  Spalding tries to stop him.

			SPALDING
		Sir - you don't want to look.

Kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both bodies, does 
look, then comes out, past the weeping girl.

			KIP
		Who's that girl?

			DADE
		His fiancee, sir.

			KIP
				(astonished)
		Hardy's?

			DADE
		Kept it a bit dark.


168	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    APPROACHING DAWN.

Kip has pulled out all of Hardy's gear.  Now he starts on the tent.  
Hana comes out into the step.  Kip turns, his eyes brimming, sees her, 
sighs, then turns back and kicks at the pegs, collapsing the tent.

Now he's trying to fold a shirt.  Hana takes it from him.  She folds 
it.  Then together they start to fold the tent, Kip orchestrating, not 
wanting to talk.  Finally, Kip looks at Hana, stiff with emotion.

			KIP
		I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! -
		the Patient, Hardy: they're
		everything that's good about England.
		I couldn't even say what that was.
		We didn't exchange two personal words,
		and we've been together through some
		terrible things, some -
				(incredulous)
		he was engaged to a girl in the village! -
		I mean -
				(looks at Hana)
		and us - he never once... He didn't
		ask me if I could spin the ball at
		cricket or the kamasutra or -
		I don't even know what I'm 
		talking about.

			HANA
		You loved him.


169*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio, reading Dante aloud in Italian, smoking, walks over to the 
window, looks out.


169*.	EXT.    KIP'S TENT.    EVENING.

Hana is approaching Kip's tent, carrying a light.  She ducks inside the 
tent and the light disappears.


169b*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio turns back into the room, towards the Patient, still 
reading.


170	INT.    KIP'S TENT.    NIGHT.

Hana lies over Kip, unraveling his turban, slowly, sensual.

			HANA
		If one night I didn't come to the tent,
		what would you do?
			KIP
		I try not to expect you.

			HANA
		But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?

			KIP
		Then I'd think there must be a reason.

			HANA
		You wouldn't come to find me?
				(Kip shrugs)
		That makes me never want to come here.

But she continues unraveling the turban.

			HANA
		Then I tell myself he spends all
		day searching, in the night he
		wants to be found.


171*.	EXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  1939.  DAY.

The Expedition Team is packing up the Basecamp.  Madox and Almásy are 
loading things into the plane.  FOUAD, AL AUF and others work at the 
cars.

			MADOX
		Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria
		is still out, which I'm looking forward
		to.  She says Dorset is gripped with
		Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I
		should have thought, still...

			ALMÁSY
		Right.

			MADOX
		Bermann thinks he'll be interned,
		poor fellow.  I'm going to do what
		I can, but...  And D'Ag turns out 
		to be a great admirer of Mussolini.
		So now you can say I told you so.

			ALMÁSY
		I told you so.

			MADOX
		We didn't care about countries.
		Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians,
		Germans.  None of that mattered,
		did it?  It was something finer than that.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass.
		I'll look after it for you.

			MADOX
				(shrugging this off)
		When's Clifton picking you up?

			ALMÁSY
		Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry.
		I'll be ready.

			MADOX
		I'll leave the plane in the hangar at
		Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it...hard to
		know how long one's talking about.  We
		might all be back in a month or two.

Madox kneels and takes A HANDFUL OF SAND, puts it into his pocket.  He 
throws his haversack into the plane then turns.  Almásy puts out a 
hand.  This is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, 
conducted as if nothing were happening.

			MADOX
		I have to teach myself not to read
		too much into everything.  Comes of
		too long having to read so much into
		hardly anything at all.

			ALMÁSY
		Goodbye, my friend.

They shake hands.

			MADOX
		May God make safety your companion.

			ALMÁSY
				(a tradition)
		There is no God.
				(smiles)
		But I hope someone looks after you.

Madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his 
throat.

			MADOX
		In case you're still wondering - this
		is called the supasternal notch.

Almásy nods, goes to the propeller.

			MADOX
		Come and visit us in Dorset.  When
		all this nonsense is over.
				(then shrugs)
		You'll never come to Dorset.

The plane roars into life.  Almásy watches it taxi away - then heads 
back to continue with his packing up.


172*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

MADOX SHOOTS HIMSELF BEHIND THE ALTAR IN THE ROOM.  The Patient's 
stertorous breathing, each intake accompanied by a small noise, a note, 
suddenly stops.  Then steadies again.  He appears to be alone.


173	EXT.    GARDEN.    NIGHT.

Kip is in the tent, looking out of the flap, waiting for Hana.


174*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Kip walks in looking for Hana.


174a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Kip enters, sees Hana is not with the Patient, hears his uneven 
breathing, then goes out.  From the shadows of the room, CARAVAGGIO 
shifts position.   He's slumped on the floor, staring at the man prone 
in the bed.


174b*.	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Into her bedroom, Kip can't find her there either.  He turns to go, 
walking down the wooden stairs, until her voice stops him in his 
tracks.  She's in the shadows of the eaves.

			HANA
		Sometimes I need you to find me.


175*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.     NIGHT.

The Patient's eyes open to see Caravaggio at the morphine.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana tells me you're leaving.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(preparing the injection)
		There are going to be trials, they
		want me to interpret, don't they
		know I'm allergic to courtrooms?

			THE PATIENT
		We shall miss you.

He delivers the injection.  The Patient sighs.  Caravaggio takes off 
his jacket.  A pistol is stuck in his waistband.  The Patient sees it.

			CARAVAGGIO
		So, I come across the Hospital Convoy
				(holds up the syringe)
		I was looking for this stuff, and some
		nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me
		about you and Hana, hiding in a
		monastery, in purdah, whatever it is -
		retreat -
				(he administers his own injection, 
using his teeth grip the sleeve)
		how you'd come in from the Desert
		and you were burned and you didn't
		know your name but you knew the
		words to every song there was and
		you had one possession -
				(picks it up)
		#NAME?
		full of letters and cuttings, and then
		I knew it must be you.

			THE PATIENT
		Me?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'd seen you writing in that book.  
		At the Embassy in Cairo, when I
		had thumbs and you had a face.
		And a name.

			THE PATIENT
		I see.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Before you went over to the Germans,
		before you got Rommel's spy across the
		desert and inside British headquarters.
		He took some pretty good photographs -
		I saw mine in that torture room in 
		Tobruk, so they made an impression.  

			THE PATIENT
		And you thought you'd come and
		settle the score?

			CARAVAGGIO
		You were the only man who knew
		the desert well enough, the only
		man who would cross seventeen
		hundred miles of nothing.

			THE PATIENT
		I had to get back to the desert. I made a
		promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.

			CARAVAGGIO
		What did you say?

			THE PATIENT
		The rest meant nothing to me.

			CARAVAGGIO
		There was a result to what you did.
		It wasn't just another expedition.
				(holds up hands)
		It did this.  If the British hadn't
		unearthed your nosey photographer
		in Cairo thousands of people could
		have died.

			THE PATIENT
		Thousands of people did die, just
		different people.

			CARAVAGGIO
		But you were among the British, they 
		were your friends - why betray them?

			THE PATIENT
				(a bitter laugh)
		Is that what you thought?  That I
		betrayed the British?  The British
		betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.


176*.	EXT.   BASECAMP AT CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   1939.   DAY.

Almásy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his 
Herodotus onto a sheet of paper.  He looks up at the sound of Clifton's 
approaching Steerman.  He folds up the map and sticks it inside one of 
Clifton's CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES and lodges it between the rocks.

 
176a*.	INT.    STEERMAN.    DAY.

Clifton is flying the STEERMAN up to Gilf Kebir.  From the air it's 
possible to make out Almásy scrambling down from the ridge towards 
where the stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last of the 
materials from the Cave of Swimmers.  Almásy waves in recognition and 
welcome.


177	EXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   DAY.

Almásy watches as the plane drops towards him, shielding his eyes 
against the sun.  the plane bounces along the runway, not quite 
landing.  Almásy continues packing the equipment.

Almásy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly HEADING STRAIGHT 
TOWARDS HIM.  He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run.  He dives at 
the ground.  THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS 
OVER AND OVER, the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the 
prostrate Almásy.  He gets to his feet and starts to run towards the 
wreckage.

A blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire.  Almásy 
pulls away the debris to find  GEOFFREY - SLUMPED, NECK BROKEN, BLOODY.  
He tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his ABSOLUTE 
horror, KATHARINE, STARING GRIMLY AHEAD, UNABLE TO MOVE.  He's frantic.

			ALMÁSY
		Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine -
		what are you doing here?

			KATHARINE
				(eyes rolling, an incredible weariness)
		I can't move.  I can't get out.

Almásy starts to pull at the wreck around her.
DURING THIS -

			ALMÁSY
		Why did he bring you?

			KATHARINE
		A surprise, he said.

Almásy inspects Clifton, tries to find a pulse.  The smoke circles 
around them.  Katharine looks at her husband.

			KATHARINE
		Poor Geoffrey.  He knew.  He must
		have known all the time.  He was
		shouting - I love you, Katharine, 
		I love you so much.  Is he badly hurt?
		His neck is odd.

Almásy puts his arm around Katharine to try and pull her clear.  She 
can't stand the pain.

			KATHARINE
		Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.

			ALMÁSY
		We've got to get you out of here.

			KATHARINE
		It hurts too much.

			ALMÁSY
				(can't bear to hurt her)
		I know, darling, I'm sorry.

The smoke thickens.  He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes 
Katharine to gasp, then pass out.  They slip haphazardly to the ground, 
cushioned a little by the sand.  He lifts her gently into his arms and 
carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back.  
THE PLANE SUDDENLY ERUPTS IN FLAMES.  Almásy dashes into the fire, 
disappearing into the smoke before emerging with Clifton over his 
shoulder, fireman's-lift style.


178	EXT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

He has WRAPPED KATHARINE IN THE SILK FOLDS OF HER PARACHUTE and emerges 
from the near the familiar cleft in the rock, struggling with the 
exertion of the climb as they approach the Cave of Swimmers.  He has a 
large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack, and is loaded 
like a pack horse.  Katharine opens her eyes.

			KATHARINE
				(whispering)
		Why did you hate me?

			ALMÁSY
		What?

			KATHARINE
		Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

			ALMÁSY
		Don't talk.

			KATHARINE
				(gasping)
		You speak so many bloody languages
		and you never want to talk.

They stagger on.  He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck.  
It's saffron, leaking from a silver THIMBLE which hangs from a black 
ribbon.

			ALMÁSY
				(overwhelmed)
		You're wearing the thimble.

			KATHARINE
		Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it.
		I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.

Almásy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the 
pain of it.  They approach the Cave.


179*.	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Almásy comes through in shadows, carrying Katharine, blocking out the 
light that pours into the entrance of the cave.  Once inside, he sets 
her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of blankets and the parachute.  
He turns on his flashlight.

			KATHARINE
		It's so cold.

			ALMÁSY
		I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire.
		I'll be back.

			KATHARINE
				(panicking suddenly)
		Don't leave me!

			ALMÁSY
		I'm just going to find things for the fire.


179a*.	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

Almásy returns with the stocks of ACACIA TWIGS the Expedition had 
cached.  As he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting 
across the walls.

			KATHARINE
		Shall we be all right?

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  Absolutely.

			KATHARINE
				(with a laugh)
		Oh dear.

			ALMÁSY
				(as he works)
		Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken
		your ankle and I'm going to have to try
		and bind it.  I think your wrist might be
		broken, too - and some ribs, which is
		why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm
		going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given
		all the traffic in the desert these days
		I should bump into one army or another
		before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes
		and his camel.  And then I'll be back 
		and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.

The fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.

			KATHARINE
		Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die
		here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert.
		I've always had a rather elaborate funeral
		in mind, with particular hymns.  Very
		English.  And I know exactly where I
		want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where
		I grew up.  With a view of the sea.  So
		promise me you'll come back for you.

			ALMÁSY
		I promise I'll come back.  I promise
		I'll never leave you.  And there's
		plenty of water and food.  You
		can have a party.

He kisses her tenderly.  Pulls out his HERODOTUS and lays it beside 
her.  Then he puts down the FLASHLIGHT.

			ALMÁSY
		And a good read.
				(of the flashlight battery)
		Don't waste it.

			KATHARINE
		Thank you.
				(clouds over)
		Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know
		he's dead.

			ALMÁSY
		I'm sorry, Katharine.

			KATHARINE
		I know.

			ALMÁSY
		Every night I cut out my heart but 
		in the morning it was full again.

He's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife.  As he starts to 
bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the 
pain.

			ALMÁSY
		Tell me about your garden.

			KATHARINE
				(tries to focus)
		Our Garden, our garden - not so much
		the garden, but the copse alongside it,
		wild, a secret way plunging down to the
		shore and then nothing but water
		between you and France.  The Devil's
		Chimney it was called -
				(he pulls tight on the binding)
		The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.
				(he kisses her)
		Darling.  My darling.


180	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

ALMÁSY BURYING CLIFTON.  He's dug a narrow trench, and now he goes to 
the body.  Clifton's face is oil stained, bloody.  Almásy takes his 
handkerchief and, pouring his precious water into it, CLEANS GEOFFREY'S 
FACE.

			THE PATIENT'S (O/S)
		Seventy miles, north - north west.
		I had Madox's compass.  A man can
		walk in the desert as fast as a camel.
		That's about two and a half miles an hour.


181	EXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

Alamos's walking.  He slides and collapses as he misjudges a dune, gets 
up, stumbles on.

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		I stopped at noon and at twilight.
		Three days there, I told her, then
		three hours back by jeep.  Don't go
		anywhere.  I'll be back.


182	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAWN.

He trudges on, his eyes opening and closing.  He's singing to keep 
awake.  Darktown Strutter's Ball. - I'll be down to get you in the 
taxi, honey...  He does a little shuffle.  Looks behind at the crazy 
trail of his footprints.


182a*.	EXT.    THE CHOTT.    DAWN.

A vast flat expanse of dried salt lake.  A remorseless horizon.  Almasy 
walks, checking the compass, squinting at the sun.  then he sees a 
cloud of dust traveling across the horizon.  It comes closer moving at 
great speed, reveals itself.  An OSTRICH.


183	EXT.    WELL.    DAY.

Almásy lowers himself by an old rope down into a gully.  He approaches 
a pile of stones and removes them to reveal a brackish pool of filthy 
water.  He drinks, pouring water over his head, grimacing at the taste, 
but parched too.


184*.	EXT.    APPROACHING EL TAJ.    DAY.

Almásy gets his first sight of the fortress town of EL TAJ and sinks to 
his knees, in relief and exhaustion.  Then he gets up and trudges 
towards the town.  A CORPORAL with a rifle in his hands appears.


184a*.	INT.    EL TAJ.    DAY.

The Corporal brings Almásy into a square.  A young OFFICER appears from 
the shadows of his office.  His JEEP is parked in the shade.

			OFFICER
		Good morning!

			ALMÁSY
		Could I trouble you for some water?

			OFFICER
				(registering the accented English)
		Yes, of course.
				(the Corporal has a water bottle,
hands it to Almásy)
		So, golly, where have you come from?

			ALMÁSY
				(gulping the water)
		I desperately need a jeep.  There's
		been an accident.

			OFFICER
		I see.

			ALMÁSY
				(brain racing)
		No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need
		a doctor too, to come with me, can I
		take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course -
		and some morphine and...
				(calculating)
		Seventy miles - I can be back
		here by dusk.

			OFFICER
		Do you have your papers, sir?

			ALMÁSY
		What?

			OFFICER
		If I could just see some identification.

			ALMÁSY
		Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me,
		I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a
		woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir,
		in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a
		member of the Royal Geographical
		Society.

			OFFICER
		Right.  And what's your name, sir?

			ALMÁSY
		Count Laszlo de Almásy.

The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.

			OFFICER
		Almásy - would you mind just
		spelling that for me?  What
		nationality would that be?

			ALMÁSY
		Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying -
		my wife! - is dying seventy miles from
		here.  I have been walking for three
		days!  I don't want to spell my name, 
		I want you to give me this jeep!

			OFFICER
				(writing)
		I understand you are agitated -
		perhaps you would like to sit down
		while I radio back to HQ -

			ALMÁSY
				(snapping)
		No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody,
		just give me the fucking jeep!

Almásy sets on the Officer, hauling him by the lapels, but them 
immediately loses his balance.  As he stumbles up he gets the stock of 
the Corporal's RIFLE across his head, KNOCKING HIM TO THE GROUND.


185*.	EXT.   EL TAJ STREET.    DAY.

Almásy, head pounding, is in the back of the jeep, chained to the 
tailgate.  He's desperate.  The Corporal is driving.

			ALMÁSY
				(shouting hoarse)
		Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me
		out of here - there's a woman dying,
		there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!

			CORPORAL
		Shut-up!

			ALMÁSY
		Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you,
		please listen to me, this is a terrible
		mistake.  Just stop, please, and
		listen to me.  My wife is dying.

			CORPORAL
		Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen
		to another word from you I'll
		give you a fucking good hiding.

			ALMÁSY
		Fritz?  What are you talking about?
		Who's Fritz?

			CORPORAL
		That's your name innit?  Count
		Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck?
		What's that supposed to be then, Irish?

Almásy, berserk, starts to yank at his chains, screaming.

			ALMÁSY
		Let me out, let me out, let me out -
		Katharine!  Katharine!


186	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

Katharine has been writing in the Herodotus.  The torchlight FLICKERS.  
She shakes the torch.   It FLICKERS again.  Then goes out.  Absolute 
BLACKNESS.  The sound of her trembling breath.


187*.	EXT.    A TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

A TRAIN scuttles through the desert.


187a*.	INT.    THE TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

Almásy is HANDCUFFED to the metal grille of the goods compartment.  
He's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little 
bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some Arabs, some 
Italians.

A SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving 
behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across 
his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gulliver's Travels.  Almásy is in 
complete despair to be on the train.  He tries to move, but he's locked 
tight to the grille.  He rattles the cuffs against the metal.

			ALMÁSY
		Excuse me.
				(the Soldier looks up)
		I also need to use the lavatory.

			SOLDIER
		You'll have to wait.
				(calls up the corridor)
		Sarge!  Jerry wants to use the lav -
		says it's urgent.

			ALMÁSY
		Where are we going, please?

			SOLDIER
		To the coast.  Benghazi.  Soon be there.
		Get a boat home.  You'll be all right.

ALMÁSY CAN'T BEAR THIS NEWS.  The SERGEANT returns.

			SERGEANT
		What's up?

			ALMÁSY
		Cramps.  It's urgent.

			SERGEANT
		Go on then - you take him.


188	INT.    THE TRAIN CORRIDOR.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

The Soldier pushes Almásy along the corridor.  They arrive outside the 
lavatory.  The Soldier is distracted for a split second.  Enough for 
Almásy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he KICKS 
HIM REPEATEDLY in the head.  He wraps his cuffs around the Soldier's 
neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny, 
efficient and sickening snap.

He finds the KEY to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and 
drags him into the empty lavatory.


189	INT.    TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.

Almásy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the Kitchen carriage, 
where Arabs sweat over the boiler.  He pulls open the back door only to 
surprise a GUARD, who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset.  Almásy 
SHOOTS HIM with his stole rifle.  He clambers over the guard rail and 
leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset.


190	EXT.    RAILWAY TRACK.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.

Almásy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track, 
THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY from the dying Katharine Clifton, no way now 
of saving her.  He is a tiny speck in the vast desert.  His heart 
broken.  He sinks to his knees in despair.


191*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

The Patient is exhausted.  He has said aloud what has tortured him.  
His failure to save Katharine.  He looks at Caravaggio.

			THE PATIENT
		So yes.  She died because of me.
		Because I loved her.  Because I 
		had the wrong name.


192	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.

Kip is working at a BLACKSMITH'S FORGE in the Stables.  He is heating 
pieces of metal.  He has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet, 
a rifle, a piece of bomb casting.

	Hana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind.

			HANA
		What are you up to?

			KIP
		That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon -
		Zamzammah - remember?  That was 
		made out of the metal of ordinary things.  
		I want to make an ordinary thing
		out of guns.

His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.

			KIP
		When I went to England I was amazed at
		what went on, the waste - I'd been taught
		to re-use everything, the dung from a cow
		to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a
		typewriter - India could live for a 
		hundred years on what I saw thrown away.

			HANA
		I should go to the house, get breakfast.

			KIP
		The lamp was burning all night in his
		room.  Caravaggio was there with him.

She goes to kiss him.   He is over the fire and protests.

			KIP
		This is hot!

			HANA
				(teasing him)
		Nya-nya-nya!


193*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine.

			CARAVAGGIO
		And did you never see Katharine?  You
		never got back to the Cave?

			THE PATIENT
		Yes, I got back there finally to keep
		my promise.  To come back for her.
		And then of course I couldn't... I
		couldn't even do that properly.


194	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.

Kip hammers the metal into its new shape.  He stops, distracted by 
something he's listening to on his crystal set.  It's new he seems not 
to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on Japan.  A NEW KIND OF 
BOMB.

THE METAL GLOWS A VIVID RED ON THE ANVIL.
Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing 
column of steam.


195*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Caravaggio sits by the Patient.

			CARAVAGGIO
		You get to the morning and the
		poison leaks away, doesn't it?
		Black nights, fucking black nights,
		when you want to howl like a dog.
		I thought I would kill you.  You
		killed my friends, you ruined my
		hands.  But the girl was always
		here, like some Guardian Angel.

			THE PATIENT
		You can't kill me.  I died years ago.

			CARAVAGGIO
		No, now I can't kill you.

Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and POINTS A 
GUN AT HIM.  Caravaggio is taken by surprise.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip - what are - ?

			KIP
		Stay out of this.

			THE PATIENT
		Kip?

			KIP
		I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother
		always said I was a fool.  Never trust the
		British, he said: the deal-makers, the
		map-makers; never shake hands with them.

			THE PATIENT
		What are you talking about?

			KIP
		What have I been doing all this time?
		Do you know how many mines I've seen? -
		more mines than there are soldiers, more -
		how many mines we've put in the ground
		ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped
		out of the sky.  And now this.

He approaches the bed.  Caravaggio tries to intervene.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip, listen -

Kip sings the rifle at him, KNOCKING HIM to the floor.

			KIP
		I said keep out of this!

He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head, 
dropping the set onto the bed.  The Patient listens, coughing.

			KIP
		Can you hear?  Can you hear what they're
		celebrating?  I listened to you, Uncle.
		Sitting at your feet - always sitting at
		somebody's feet - trying to learn.  The
		right way to hold a teacup, otherwise
		you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie -
		as if everything can be explained in
		terms of a cricket bat and an accent.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip -

			KIP
		Kip! - it's not even my name because
		you can't say it.  Kirpal Singh Bhuller
		is my name.

Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Well, then ask him his name!

			HANA
				(getting in between Kip and the Patient)
		What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening?
		Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.

			KIP
		They're excited!  They're happy about
		destroying a whole city.  Would they
		do that to a White Man's City?  Never!

			THE PATIENT
				(pulling off the earphones)
		Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip, listen, he lost everything because
		he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me,
		I'm more English than he is!

Kip levels the gun at the Patient.  Then breaks it open, throws it down 
on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to 
leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay... Hiroshima... and from 
different voices - It was beautiful!  just beautiful!  Bang! the 
biggest bang you ever saw!


196	EXT.    KIP'S TENT.    LATE DAY.

Hana approaches.  Kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped.  She sees 
his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name.  It's like a 
confessional.  The flap between them, the man in shadows, Hana 
crouched, forlorn.

			HANA
		Kip.  Kip.  It's me.
				(no response)
		Why?  It's another bomb.  However
		big, what's the difference?  There've
		been so many bombs.  What about
		Coventry?  What about Dresden?
		Where were those cities?
				(no response)
		I don't understand.  Let me come in.

The shadow doesn't move.  Hana is at a loss.


197	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

The Patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes, 
squints into the darkness and sees A FIGURE hovering against the wall.  
He's in the Cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving, 
he's seeing the Swimmer.

KIP - bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at 
the foot of the Patient's bed.


198	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Kip comes into the room.  Hana sits in the corner.  She is nervous of 
him, his look, his intensity.

			KIP
		Will you come with me?

			HANA
		Of course.  When?

			KIP
		I mean home.  India.

			HANA
		Kip... I -

			KIP 
				(interrupting this)
		I know - here I am always a brown man,
		there you would be always a white woman.

			HANA
		Is that what you think?  Is that what
		you think I think?

			KIP
		It's what I've learned.

			HANA
		I'm thinking about your heart, not
		your skin.  And how to reach it.  And
		that I don't think I can.  A bomb
		has ruined us, just not the bomb
		I thought would ruin us.

She stands, goes to him.

			HANA
		I've clung to you.  I've clung to you.
		Kip.  Life  a raft.  

			KIP 
				(clinging to her)
		Then come with me.


199	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Next morning and Kip has attached what he was making in the forge - A 
NEW HANDLE - to the pump.  Now he works it, producing a steady stream 
of water.  His motorbike is against the wall.  He goes to it.  
Caravaggio is watching.  He hugs Kip, wrapping his arms around the boy 
like a bear.


199a*.	EXT.    HANA'S VEGETABLE GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA stands by her Vegetable Garden.  Kip stops the motorbike.  She 
goes to him, stands, FASTENS THE TOP BUTTON of his coat.  You feel she 
might jump on the seat behind him.  But she doesn't.

			HANA
		I'll always go back to that church.
		Look at my painting.

			KIP
		I'll always go back to that church.

			HANA
		So one day we'll meet.

He nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.


200	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana comes in carrying FLOWERS and sets them down on the table next to 
a clutch of MORPHINE AMPOULES.  She picks up the hypodermic to prepare 
his injection.  She takes a phial.  THE PATIENT REACHES OUT AND PUSHES 
TWO MORE TOWARDS HER.   THEIR EYES MEET, THEN HE SHOVELS ANOTHER, THEN 
ALL OF THEM.  She looks at him.  IT'S A MASSIVE, LETHAL DOSE.

Hana starts to prepare the injection, her eyes filling with tears.  The 
Patient nods, smiles, whispers.

			THE PATIENT
		Thank you.  Thank you.

She kisses him, gently on the mouth.  He closes his eyes.

			THE PATIENT
		Read to me, will you?  Read me to sleep.


201*.	EXT.(NEAR THE) BASECAMP. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. 1942. DAY.

The familiar cleft in the rocks.  A PLANE is coming in to land.


202	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

A flashlight flickers in the cave.  ALMÁSY APPEARS.

KATHARINE'S CORPSE lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of silk 
and blankets.  The chill of the cave has preserved her.  She could be 
asleep.  She clutches the Herodotus.

			ALMÁSY
		Katharine, my darling.

He sobs, whispering to her.  He's terribly cold, exhausted.  He slips 
underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes.

			ALMÁSY
		I'm so tired.


203*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

The Patient is slipping away.  Hana is reading from the last pages of 
the Herodotus where KATHARINE HAS WRITTEN IN THE MARGINS.

			HANA
		My darling, I'm waiting for you - how
		long is a day in the dark, or a week?

The Patient looks across AND WHAT HE SEES IS KATHARINE BESIDE HIM IN 
THE BED, SMILING, STROKING HIS HEAD, SPEAKING TO HIM.


204	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

Katharine is writing.  The FLASHLIGHT is faint.  She shivers.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...the fire is gone now, and I'm
		horribly cold.  I really ought to
		drag myself outside but then
		there would be the sun...

She passes the flashlight across the wall, the painted figures dancing 
in the pale light.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		I'm afraid I waste the light on the 
		paintings and on writing these words...


205	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

THE BED IS EMPTY, THE MATTRESS STRIPPED.  Hana stands in the doorway, 
then sees THE HERODOTUS on the bedside table.

She picks it up, goes to the page of Katharine's letter, continues to 
read.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		We die, we die rich with lovers and
		tribes, tastes we have swallowed...


206*.	EXT.    LANE OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

Caravaggio is at the gate to the Monastery.  The TRUCK we saw before is 
waiting with him.  The PARTISAN with his head bandana and shotgun 
remains the same, but now there are CHILDREN in the back and a WOMAN 
sits behind the man, nursing a two-year-old.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hana!  Come on!

He gets up into the BALUSTRADE, tentatively finds his balance, then 
starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence - 
along the long thin line of stone.  The children watch intently.  He 
turns and bows.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...bodies we have entered and swum up
		like rivers, fears we have hidden in
		like this wretched cave...


207*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.

Hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares, 
leaving it all behind.  Then she stops, bends, retrieves A SNAIL SHELL, 
keeps going.  KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.


208	INT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

ALMÁSY SMUDGES KATHARINE'S PALE FACE WITH COLOR.  OCHRE across her 
brow, BLUE on her eyelids, RED on her lips.  He presses his cheek to 
hers, smoothes her hair.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...I want all this marked on my body.
		We are the real countries, not the
		boundaries drawn on maps with the
		names of powerful men...


209*.	EXT.    THE LANE OUTSIDE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.  Hana comes out to the truck, carrying her 
small bundle.  Caravaggio effects some introduction, beginning with the 
woman driver, Gioia.  She and Caravaggio smile like lovers.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hana - this is Gioia.

Gioia smiles, shakes her hand.  Then Hana meets the others - Gioia's 
brother and wife, their children.   She smiles at them.

			HANA
		Buon' giorno.

			CARAVAGGIO
		She can take you as far as Florence.

			HANA
		I can get in the back.

And she clambers up, sits down between the children.  They exchange 
some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away.  Hana 
takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend 
and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.


210	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Almásy comes out of the cave, carrying the bundle of Katharine in his 
arms, wrapped in the silks of her parachute.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...I know you will come and carry me
		out into the palace of winds, the rumors
		of water... That's all I've wanted -
		to walk in such a place with you, with
		friends, on earth without maps.


211	EXT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.

THE PLANE growls and complains into the air.


212	INT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.

INSIDE THE COCKPIT:  THE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF THE FILM.  Almásy 
obliterated by goggles and helmet.  Katharine behind him, slumped 
forwards as if sleeping.

Almásy banks across the plateau of the Gilf Kebir and glances down.  In 
a ravine is a sudden OASIS OF WHITE ACACIAS.  He is mesmerized.

And then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the 
desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		The lamp's gone out and I'm writing
		in the darkness...

Almásy, the English Patient, begins to sing - Szerelem, Szerelem - 
until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament 
heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost.

The sound of gun fire...


THE END.

1	EXT.    LATE 1942.    THE SAHARA DESERT.    DAY.

SILENCE.  THE DESERT seen from the air.  An ocean of dunes  for mile 
after mile.  The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to 
black.

An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the 
contours of sand.

A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem, 
szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one.

INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be 
asleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE 
PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too, 
but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's 
plaintive voice.

The plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN 
AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks 
and armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses.  
The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An 
ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously.

Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches 
violently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the 
instruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not 
conscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays 
them both, then EXPLODES.

THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both 
ON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He 
looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries 
them slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no 
sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his 
face, his lover...


2	EXT.    THE DESERT.    1942.    DAY.

THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN.  Behind them the 
wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it.  A 
SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.  Another man comes 
across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot.  The 
Pilot is charred.  His helmet has melted into his head.  He's oblivious 
to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  He twists 
frantically to find her.  Two men pick him up and carry him across to a 
litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.


3	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

The Pilot is being carried across the desert.  A mask covers his face.  
His view of the world is through the slats of reed.  He glimpses 
camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.


4	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    DUSK.

The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack 
and begin to chew it.  Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the 
Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth.  
He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth.  
Mouth to mouth.


4a*.	EXT.    DESERT.    DAWN.

THE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT, silhouetted against the dunes.


5	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    NIGHT.

The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes.  A music of glass.

AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT.  It floats in 
darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to 
reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF 
SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could 
be an angel.

The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in 
the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR 
stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep 
into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the 
support of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's 
tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets 
about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's 
flesh.

The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and 
MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, 
hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl 
he'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned 
skin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and 
BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us 
humming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle.


6*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    EARLY 1945.    DAY.

The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church 
bells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some 
supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road.  The war in Italy is 
largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and 
supply lines slowly following.


7*.	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    DAY.

A young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients.  Hana 
pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her.  
This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  A web of scars 
covers the Patient's face and body.  They have the quality of a livid 
tattoo, magenta and green-black.  The hair has largely gone and the 
effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes 
liquid.  It's a warrior's face.  But he has no physical strength.  He 
coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.


8*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.

A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck 
containing Hana and the Patient.  The horn blows and Hana looks out to 
see it contains her best friend, JAN.  TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front, 
one driving, both grinning.  Jan signals for Hana's attention.

			JAN
		There's meant to be lace in the next
		village - the boys are taking me.

			HANA
		I'm not sewing anything else.

			JAN
				(mischievously)
		You don't have any money, do you?  
		Just in case there's silk.

			HANA
		No!

			JAN
		Hana, I know you do!

Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS.  The two hands - 
hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side 
by side.  They laugh at the effort.  Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the 
sun and glints.

			HANA
		I'm not sewing anything else for you!

			JAN
				(getting the money)
		I love you.

The Jeep accelerates away.  Hana sighs to the patient.

Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE.  
The jeep is THROWN into the air.  The convoy halts and there's chaos as 
soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles.  Hana runs the 
other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by 
a soldier.


9*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    LATER.

-- and there's still chaos as two SAPPERS arrive on motorcycles.  One 
of them, a SIKH, wears a turban.

The motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy.  A nurse, MARY, is 
helping a doctor, OLIVER, attend to the injured driver.  The other two 
bodies are covered with blankets.  There's blood everywhere.  The Sikh 
and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal 
equipment.


10	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.

KIP, the Sikh Lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the road 
ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL DETECTORS and 
HEADSETS.  Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch 
along the debris-strewn road.  He stiffens as he registers metal.  With 
a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  Something 
GLEAMS.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA 
HURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road.  It's so surreal that 
neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.

			KIP
		Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!

			HARDY
		Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!

 Hana stops.  Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.

			HARDY
				(as he approaches)
		Good, that's good, just stay still for me
		and then we're going to be fine.

He arrives at Hana.  Then grabs her.  He'd like to slap her face.

			HARDY
		What are you doing?!  What the bloody 
		hell do you think you're doing?

By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.  Jan's 
BRACELET lies in the mud.  Hardy bends down and collects the mangled 
bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.


11	EXT.    VILLAGE.    DUSK.

The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the souvenirs 
of war.  An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children, 
dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road.  From the end of 
one of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN CORPSES, strung upside 
down with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration 
with the Nazis.


12	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    CONTINUOUS.

Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient 
swaying alongside her.  She puts out her hand to steady him.


13*.	EXT.    CONVOY SITE, ITALY.    DUSK.

THE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP.  The trucks are silhouetted in a line.  
Hana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground.  She bends to 
him.

			HANA
		Do you need something?

The Patient nods.  Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a 
small kit.  Mary arrives.  Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief 
for Jan's death.

			MARY
		Are you okay?  Oh God, Hana, you were
		like sisters.

			HANA
				(sighs angrily)
		We keep moving him - in and out of the
		truck.  Why?  He's dying.  What's the point?

			MARY
		Well, we can't hardly leave him.  Do
		you mean leave him?  We can't.

Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher.  She draws 
herself up against the night.  On the hill above, she can see the 
outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight.  She's crying, her face 
a frozen mask.

			HANA
		I must be a curse.  Anybody who loves me,
		anybody who gets close to me -
		or I must be cursed.  Which is it?

The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.


14	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST. ANNA, wandering through its 
overgrown gardens, past a pond.  What sanctuary it seems to offer.


15*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls have 
collapsed from shelling.  The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the 
shelves.  Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a PIANO tiled up on 
one side.  Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which 
covers it.  Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation.


15a*.	INT.    MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.

Past the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.


15b*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY STAIRS.    DAY.

Hana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads two 
thirds of the way up.


15c*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

She comes across a small CHAPEL, with the remains of murals and an 
altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table.  Hana finds an 
old bed, and a mattress.


16	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

Hana comes out, passes a DRY WATER TROUGH.  She hears a rustling on the 
gravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling towards the trough.  On cue 
there's A GURGLING SOUND.  THE HANDLELESS PUMP IS SUDDENLY GUSHING, 
splashing water everywhere.  The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this, 
enjoys a welcome shower.  Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into 
the water.  Looks around her, and makes a decision.


17	EXT.    CONVOY SITE.    ITALY.    DAY.

The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up.  Oliver passes the 
vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some 
sacks of rice.

			HANA
		The war's over - you told me yourself.
		How can it be desertion?

			OLIVER
		It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean
		literally.

			HANA
		When he dies I'll catch up.

Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, 
then lays another blanket over the Patient.

			OLIVER
		It's not safe here.  The whole country's
		crawling with Bandits and Germans and God
		knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it.
		You're not, this is natural - it's shock.  
		For all of us.  Hana -

			HANA
		I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.

			OLIVER
				(clutching at straws)
		And what if he really is a spy?

			HANA
				(impatiently)
		He can't even move.

			OLIVER
		If anything happened to you I'd never
		forgive myself.

Hana nods.  A tiny smile.  Oliver shrugs helplessly.

			OLIVER
		We're heading for Leghorn.  Livorno the
		Italians call it.  We'll expect you.


18*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the 
monastery.  Hana indicates the stairs.

			HANA
		Up there.

They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly 
avoids falling into the void in the stairs.  The cot almost tips up, at 
which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but 
still clearly aristocratic.

			THE PATIENT
		There was a Prince, who was dying, and
		he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he
		could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills.
		Am I that Prince?

Hana laughs.

			HANA
		Because you're leaning?  No, you're 
		just on an angle.  You're too heavy!

Mary laughs.  They reach the landing.  Hana kicks open the door to the 
CHAPEL.

			HANA
		In here.


18a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away 
the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust.  They lower the Patient onto 
the bed.  She turns to the SOLDIERS.

			HANA
		Thank you.

She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room, 
its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos.  Hana smiles, opens a shutter 
to let a fierce envelope of light into the room.

			HANA
		Good.

	She goes to Mary and hugs her.


19*.	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

A smaller upstairs room completely bare.  As Hana tugs off her uniform, 
she looks out of the window to see the departing Convoy.  A cotton 
dress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger 
and rather fragile.   THROUGH THE DAMAGED FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A 
VIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER.  SHE LOOKS AT HIM.  NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS 
AND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR, NOT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT IN A GESTURE OF A 
NEW BEGINNING.


19a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA walks down to the Patient's Room and stands in the doorway.  The 
Patient turns his head to her.  He's grinning.  He puts up a thumb.  On 
the track a song begins:  Some Other Time.


20*.	EXT.  BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.  1938.  LATE DAY.

THE SONG CONTINUED IN THE DESERT where we find the singer - PETER 
MADOX, a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an BATTERED 
TIGER MOTH AEROPLANE.  His face is blackened with oil.  A second 
European, ALMÁSY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the 
camshaft.  Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for 
Almasy to inspect.  Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging 
in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides 
and servants to the Almásy/Madox Expedition.  It's 1938 and the whole 
continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other, 
pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities.

D'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane 
in one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS.  He gets out 
carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR.  He looks very pleased with 
himself as he shows the jar to Almásy and then passes it to Madox.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Thirsty?

			MADOX
				(sniffing inside)
		What's this?

			D'AGOSTINO
		Don't drink it!

He reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a 
brackish and stinks.  Madox makes a face.

			D'AGOSTINO
		I can't guarantee the vintage, my 
		friends.  I just dug it out of the hill.

Madox and Almásy have seen many such jugs.

			MADOX
		Excellent.  That's terrific, D'Ag.
				(to Almásy, of a tool)
		Toss that up, would you.

			D'AGOSTINO
				(mischievously)
		There are some others.


21	EXT.    POTTERY HILL.    DAY.

THE BASE OF A HILL SEEMS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF POTTERY JARS.

D'Agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading Madox and Almásy.  
The other members of the team are already there - BERMANN, a German 
PHOTOGRAPHER and FOUAD, EGYPTOLOGIST from Cairo.

			MADOX
				(to Almásy, astonished)
		My God, look at this!

They bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, 
piled on top of each other.  Bermann approaches them, carrying his 
tripod.

			BERMANN
		Incredible, Hmm?  Quite incredible.

			D'AGOSTINO
		I've never seen anything like it.  There 
		would have been enough water here to
		serve an army.

			ALMÁSY
				(gloomily)
		Which means we're in the wrong place.

Almásy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Why?

			ALMÁSY
		Would you stockpile water near to an
		Oasis?  There can't be a natural spring
		within fifty miles of here.

			FOUAD
		Or they didn't know of one.

			BERMANN
		So, it may not be Zerzura, still
		incredible.

			D'AGOSTINO
				(nodding, delighted)
		A pottery hill!

			ALMÁSY
		A wild goose chase.

			MADOX
				(firmly)
		No.

Almásy gives him a look.  But Madox will have none of it.

			MADOX
		No.  Now we look in the other places.
		We're eliminating.

The unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE distracts them.

			MADOX
		Good, and here comes reinforcements.


21a*.	EXT.    BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DAY.

LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on 
the flat desert.  The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals.  
Almásy is not with them.  He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.

A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane.  They 
are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON.

And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane-
crash at the beginning of the film.

Madox makes all the introductions.  Hands are shaken, hellos all round, 
as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear.  Geoffrey removes 
his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, 
produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.

			CLIFTON
		I hereby Christen us the International
		Sand Club!


22	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    LATE DAY.

The party is in the shade of the tents.  Almásy joins the group.  Madox 
nods over to the Clifton plane.

			MADOX
		Marvelous plane.  Did you look?

			CLIFTON
				(beaming at Almásy)
		Isn't it?  Wedding present from
		Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it
		Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

			MADOX
		We can finally consign my old bird
		to the scrapheap.

	Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.

			KATHARINE
				(smiling, offering her hand)
		Geoffrey gave me your monograph when
		I was reading up on the desert.
		Very impressive.

			ALMÁSY
				(stiff)
		Thank you.

			KATHARINE
		I wanted to meet a man who could write
		such a long paper with so few adjectives.

			ALMÁSY
		A thing is still a thing no matter what
		you place in front of it.  Big car, slow
		car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.

			CLIFTON
				(joining them and joining in)
		A broken car?

			ALMÁSY
		Still a car.

			CLIFFTON
				(hands them champagne)
		Not much use, though.

			KATHARINE
		Love?  Romantic love, platonic love,
		filial love - ?  Quite different things,
		surely?

			CLIFTON 
				(hugging Katharine)
		Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind
		of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.

			ALMÁSY
				(a dry smile)
		There you have me.


23	INT.  THE PATIENT'S ROOM.  THE MONASTERY.  MORNING.

The morning floods into the room.  The Patient lies, lost in the 
desert.  Then a sudden CLATTERING NOISE disturbs him.


24	INT.   STAIRS, THE MONASTERY.   DAY.

Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged 
stairs, and with others, she is improvising new steps.  The heavy 
volumes are perfect for treading on.


25	INT.   LIBRARY.   DAY.

Hana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out 
to continue her stair repairs.


26*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana enters.

			THE PATIENT
		What was all the banging?  Were you
		fighting rats or the entire German army?

			HANA
		I was repairing the stairs.  I found a
		library and the books were very useful.

Hana shrugs.  She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping 
up the pillows.  He's short of breath.

			THE PATIENT
		Before you find too many uses for these
		books would you read some to me?

			HANA
		I think they're all in Italian, but I'll
		look, yes.  What about your own book?

			THE PATIENT
				(reluctant)
		My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we
		can read him.

Hana picks up the book and hands it to him.  Then she starts rummaging 
in her pockets.

			HANA
		Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums
		in the orchard.  We have an orchard!

She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.

			THE PATIENT
		Thank you.

His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping 
from the mouth.  Hana mops it up.

			THE PATIENT
		The plumness of this plum.

A noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.

			THE PATIENT
		What's that?


27	INT/EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling 
increases.  She's in time to catch the TORTOISE arriving once again in 
the WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush with water.  She shouts up 
to The Patient's open window.

			HANA
		Water!
				(bends to the Tortois)
		You hear it, too, don't you!


28	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Close on the HERODOTUS.  The Patient opens its cover, held together by 
leather ties.  Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES 
are all collected between the pages.  He claws at some water-colors 
which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned 
warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with 
plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like 
those of Matisse.  Some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  Then 
the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to 
the floor with a crack.


29	INT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

A SHOT RINGS OUT, disturbing the evening meal.  Almásy and others go 
outside.  Silhouetted on a ridge, a group of men sit astride camels.  
One of them holds his rifle aloft, clearly pointing towards the sky - 
means friend.  Fouad peers at the horizon.

			FOUAD
		European, I think, with guides.

			CLIFTON
				(can only see shapes)
		How do you know?

			MADOX
				(frowns)
		Yes, and I think I know who this is.


30	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

ALMÁSY AND MADOX WALK OUT TO INTERCEPT THE ARRIVALS as the first Arab 
dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse.  
Almásy speaks in Arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings.

DURING THIS, FENELON-BARNES, sole European in this expedition, has 
finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping 
the animal in disgust.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Ugly brute.  Shits and roars and
		complains all day.
				(bypassing Almásy and
approaching Madox)
		Of course, you have your aeroplane.  
		Two now!  Do you still call yourselves
		explorers?  I assume not.

			MADOX
				(stiffly)
		Fenelon-Barnes.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an
		explorer, can't he?  Or should Columbus
		have swum to America?


31	INT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

The arrivals come inside.  Madox handles the introductions.

			MADOX
		I think you know all of us, except for
		Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've
		recently come out from England.

			CLIFTON
		Apprentices.

			MADOX
		This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.

			FENELON-BARNES
				(to Katharine)
		I know your mother, of course.

			KATHARINE
		Hello.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'm also searching for the lost Oasis, 
		but by more authentic means.

			MADOX
				(of Almásy)
		Anyway, my friend here has a new theory -
		that Zerzura doesn't exist.  So we may all
		be chasing windmills.  Have some food.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Well, it's certainly not between here and
		Dakhla.  Nine days of nothing but sand
		and sandstorms.  An egg.  I found an
		ostrich egg and some fossils.

			KATHARINE
		Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by
		spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?

			ALMÁSY
		What kind of fossils?

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'll invite you to my paper at the
		Royal Geographical Society.
		Are you still a member?

He takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing camel milk.

			ALMÁSY
		I think you know I am.

			FENELON-BARNES
				(ignoring Almásy)
		Quite impossible, Madox.  You must know 
		that.  If you attempt to cross the Sand
		Sea due east of Kufra by car you'll leave
		your bones in the sand for me to collect.

			ALMÁSY
				(leaving the tent)
		If you come across my bones - I hope
		you'll do me the honor of leaving 
		them in peace.
				(to Katharine)
		Excuse me.

			FENELON-BARNES
		You have my word as a gentleman.
				(watching him leave)
		I've discovered a unique type of
		sand-dune.  I've applied to the King
		for permission to call it 
		The Fenelon-Barnes Formation.


32	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.

	LATER, supper over, the company is entertaining itself.

Almásy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a 
distance.

D'Ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of  Puccini's E 
Lucevan Le Stelle.  He sits down to much applause from the others and 
SPINS AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE on the sand.  It comes to rest pointing 
at Clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into Yes! We Have No 
Bananas with great gusto.  His version involves CHANGING LANGUAGE 
during each line of the chorus - prompted by Oui!  or Ja!  or Si!  from 
the others.  Song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle 
and it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-Barnes and Katharine - until 
with a little NUDGE from the husband it settles on his wife.  Katharine 
gets up, awkward.

			KATHARINE
		I can't sing.
				(the audience groans)
		but I can tell a story.
				(to Almásy, who has arrived)
		I might need a prompt.  Do you have your
		Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it...

			ALMÁSY
		I'm sorry - what have you noticed?

			MADOX
		Your book.  Your Herodotus!

Almásy looks uncomfortable.

			KATHARINE
				(reacting quickly)
		It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can
		muddle through.  Okay - The Story of 
		Candaules and Gyges.  King Candaules was
		passionately in love with his wife -
				(Geoffrey whistles proudly)
		One day he said to Gyges, the son of
		somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -

			ALMÁSY
				(quietly prompting her)
		Daskylus...

			KATHARINE
				(smiles)
		Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus -
		Candaules said to him I don't think you
		believe me when I tell you how beautiful
		my wife is.  And although Gyges replied he
		did find the Queen magnificent the King 
		insisted he would find some way to prove
		beyond dispute that she was fairest of
		all women.  Do you all know this story?

The men all encourage her to continue her story.


33*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

- and Hana's voice CONTINUES THE STORY as she reads to the Patient who 
listens, eyes closed, still in the desert.

			HANA
				(reading from the Herodotus)
		I will hide you in the room where 
		we sleep, said Candaules.

She stumbles over the word.

			THE PATIENT
		Candaules

			HANA
				(not neurotic)
		Candaules...you're laughing at me.

			THE PATIENT
		I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.

			HANA
		When my wife comes to lie down she always
		lays her garments one by one on a seat
		near the entrance of the room, and from
		where you stand you will be able to gaze
		on her at your leisure...


34*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.

			KATHARINE
				(her story continuing)
		And that evening, it's exactly as the
		King had told him, she goes to the chair
		and removes her clothes, one by one, 
		until she stand naked in full view of
		Gyges.  And indeed she was more lovely
		than he could have imagined.

Almásy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky.  Katharine turns 
to looks at him.

			KATHARINE
		But then the Queen looked up and saw
		Gyges concealed in the shadows.   And
		though she said nothing, she shuddered.
		The next day she sent for Gyges and
		challenged him.  And hearing his story,
		she said this -

			CLIFTON
		Off with his head!

			KATHERINE
		#NAME?
		death for gazing on that which you
		should not, or else kill my husband who
		shamed me and become King in his place.

Clifton makes a face of outrage.  For Katherine the story has 
collapsed.  She wants it to be finished.

			KATHERINE
		So Gyges killed the King and married
		the Queen and became ruler of Lydia
		for twenty eight years.  The End.
				(an uncomfortable moment)
		Do I spin the bottle?

Almásy shrinks away from the fire, disappears into black.

			MADOX
				(to Clifton)
		And let that be a lesson to you!


35	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana looks up from the Herodotus, sees the Patient's eyes closed.  
Gently touches his face and whispers.

			HANA
		Are you asleep?

			THE PATIENT
				(lying)
		Yes.  Dropping off.

And Hana closes the book, gets up, and blows out the lamp.  


36	INT.   FENELON-BARNES TENT.   POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.

PITCH BLACK and then A TORCH flickers on as Almásy enters Fenelon-
Barnes' tent.  He pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically.  
He finds what he is looking for inside a trunk:  A LARGE FOSSILIZED 
BRANCH; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin.  
Then he's distracted by a noise from Fenelon-Barnes' bed.  Almásy 
stiffens, turns to investigate.  There's A LUMP in the cot.  A dog?  
Almásy eases back the blanket to reveal a YOUNG GIRL, no more than 
fourteen, bound hand and foot.  He holds the torch to her face.


37	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    MORNING.

The next morning.  Almásy and Madox prepare to take off.  As they talk 
Clifton's Rupert Bear taxis past them, a wave from Clifton and 
Katharine.  Madox is very disturbed by what Almásy is telling him.

			MADOX
		What did you think you were
		doing in his tent?

			ALMÁSY
		Looking for the fossils.  Why should we
		wait until we're in London?  This girl 
		was probably twelve years old.

			MADOX
				(getting into the plane)
		You shouldn't go into another man's tent.
		It's inexcusable.

			ALMÁSY
		Her hands and feet were tied.

			MADOX
		What did you do?

			ALMÁSY
		I looked at them.  They're shrubs,
		small trees.  Exquisite.  And
		fossilized, rock hard.

He walks away to the nose of the plane.

			MADOX
		I was talking about the girl.

			ALMÁSY
		Cut the ropes.  I left a note,
		on his blanket.
				(gleefully)
		At the next Geographical Society I 
		shall await with great interest the
		announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes
		Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, 
		of course.  Her father had sold her
		for a camel.

He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.


38	EXT.    GILF KEBIR PLATEAU.    MORNING.

Both planes are scouting the Gilf Kebir region.  Geoffrey flies up 
alongside Madox and wiggles his wings.  Madox waves.

They're flying over a distinctive group of GRANITE MASSIFS, Crater-
shaped hills.  The broken towers of the Gilf Kebir.  Almasy is 
distracted by them.  He turns to Madox and points down, indicating they 
should explore them.

Madox gestures to the Cliftons to PHOTOGRAPH the Massifs.  A THUMBS UP 
from Geoffrey.


39*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Hana gives the Patient his injection, now she begins to change the 
sheet.  The light streams in from the open window.  She looks up at the 
green hills rolling away from the Monastery, the village in the 
distance.

			HANA
		I should try and move your bed.  I want
		you to be able to see the view.  It's
		good, it's a view from a monastery.

			THE PATIENT
		I can already see.

			HANA
				(bending down to his level)
		How?  How can you see anything?

			THE PATIENT
		Not the window - I can't bear the light
		anyway - no, I can see all the way to 
		the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.

			HANA
		I'm turning you.

An awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back.  He grunts with the 
pain.  She washes him very tenderly.

			THE PATIENT
		Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the
		Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the
		scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can
		smell it.  The taste of tea so black it
		falls into your mouth.  I can taste it.
		I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my
		eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

			HANA
		No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.

			THE PATIENT
		I can see my wife in that view.

			HANA
		Are you remembering more?

			THE PATIENT
		Could I have a cigarette?

			HANA
		Are you crazy?

			THE PATIENT
		Why are you so determined to
		keep me alive?

			HANA
		Because I'm a nurse.


40	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDENS.    NOON.

The TORTOISE heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment.  
It reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis 
shoes, a frock.  It clambers over as the water begins to belch out.  
Hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great 
YELP of shivering joy.


41*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.

It's dark, but something is going on here.  Hana is caught by the stray 
shafts of moonlight.  She is SCRATCHING something on the flagstones.  
Her skirt is bunched up around her thighs.  She throws something in the 
air.  It's a SPILE, used to tap into the maple tree for syrup.  It 
lands with a crack.  Suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a 
skip, a jump.  Then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then 
back again, in this blindman's version of HOPSCOTCH.


42*.	INT.    TRAIN.    ITALY 1944.    BEFORE DAWN.

AS HANA HOPS AND JUMPS IN THE SHADOWS SHE IS SUDDENLY ON A TRAIN IN 
1944.  A HOSPITAL TRAIN ploughs through the night carrying the wounded 
back to Naples.

Hana walks through a long carriage.  HER HAIR IS LONG.  She could be 
ten years younger than the Hana at the Monastery.  And easy.  She stops 
at the bunk of A NEW PATIENT.  Hana bends to the boy.  He's had 
shrapnel in his legs and cheek.  She speaks softly to him.

			HANA
		How are you?

			BOY
		Okay.

			HANA
		Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel
		came out - I saved you the pieces.

			BOY
		You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.

			HANNA
				(she hears this every day)
		I don't think so.

			BOY
		Would you kiss me?

			HANA
		No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till
		you're in Naples.  You'll find a
		girl there.

			BOY
				(innocent)
		Just kiss me.  It would mean
		such a lot to me.

			HANA
				(tender, believing him)
		Would it?

She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.

			BOY
		Thank you.

He closes his eyes.  Is almost instantly asleep.  Hana smiles, 
continues along the compartment.  VOICES CALL OUT.

			#1 INJURED MAN
		Nurse - I can't sleep.

			#2 INJURED MAN
		Nurse?  Would you kiss me?

			#3 INJURED MAN
		You're so pretty!

			#4 INJURED MAN
		Hinky-dinky parlez-vous!

			HANA
				(good-naturedly waving
away their joke)
		Very funny.  Go to sleep.

She gets into a corridor.  Mary is coming the other way.  She carries a 
blood-soaked bundle.  Hana questions her appalled expression.

			MARY
		Don't ask.


43	INT.    RAILWAY STATION.    DAY.

The train is arriving.  Hana hangs out of a window, scouring the crowds 
to find her sweetheart, STUART McGANN, a young Canadian Captain, who 
seeing her runs up to her window.

			HANA
		Where are we going?  I don't want to be
		kissing in a crowd.  I have six hours.

She jumps out of the moving door and into his arms.

			STUART
				(laughing at her ferocity)
		Whoa - give me a chance!

			HANA
		Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.

The Station is full of desperate people trying to make do.  the couple 
hurry through, oblivious to anyone except each other.

			STUART
		I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go
		to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.

			HANA
		I'd like to spend a night with you
		in a bed.

			STUART
		We can do that when we're very very old.


44	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana lies alone in her bed covered by a curtain.  There's a sharp 
NOISE.  She's very frightened.  She has her pistol under her pillow and 
pulls it out, listens, holding her breath.  Another BANG.  She listens.


45	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.

Hana has been reviving a vegetable patch.  She comes to garden.  CROWS 
are feasting.  She's furious, shouts, runs at them.  Nature, wildness, 
insisting on invading her peace.


46*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    GRAVEYARD.    MORNING.

Hana appears from the Cemetery, dragging A METAL CRUCIFIX.  It's bigger 
than she is, and she drags it, as if approaching Calvary.  A MAN 
WATCHER HER FROM A BICYCLE.  He's approaching fifty, grizzled and 
attractive, and could be Italian.  His hands are bandaged.  Hana aims 
the cross at the soil, but is not quite bit or strong enough.  The man, 
CARAVAGGIO, chooses this moment to introduce himself.  He drops the 
bicycle on the ground with a clatter.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(very cheerful)
		Buon' Giorno!

Hana turns, startled and suspicious.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Are you Hana?

			HANA
		What do you want?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I met your friend Mary.  She said I
		should stop and see if you were okay.
		Apparently we're neighbors - my house
		is two blocks from yours in Montreal.
		Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

			HANA
				(unraveling this information)
		Bonjour.

He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand behind her ear - PRODUCES 
AN EGG.  He beams, as does Hana.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'd like to take credit, but it's from
		Mary.  My name's David Caravaggio,
		but nobody ever called me David.
		Caravaggio they find to absurd to
		miss out on.

During this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to Hana's 
other ear.  THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND.  Cursing, he gets on his knees 
and starts to scoop it up, preserving it.


47*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    KITCHEN.    DAY.

Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl.  She beats them with 
a knife picking out the bits of shell.  Caravaggio watches, takes in 
how little food there is otherwise.  The table seems useful more as a 
sewing area than for cooking - it's STREWN WITH ALTAR CLOTHS being sewn 
into drapes.  On a tray on the table are TWO PHIALS OF MORPHINE from 
the Patient's room.  As Hana turns to the stove, he's moved and covered 
them with his bandaged hands, a second later and he's juggled them into 
his pockets with the slightest clink.  Hana looks at him.  He shrugs, 
nods at the eggs.

			CARAVAGGIO
		They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg
		in...have you noticed there are chickens?
		You get chickens in Italy but no eggs.
		In Africa there were always eggs, but
		never chickens.  Who separates them?

			HANA
		You were in Africa?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Yeah, for a while.

			HANA
		So was my Patient.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'd like to stay.  That's the long and
		short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah
		if it's convenient, if there's room 
		blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some 
		work here -I speak the language.  
		There are Partisans to be -
				(trying to paraphrase)
		#NAME?
		relieve them of their weapons, you 
		know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so 
		they think I'd be good at that.

			HANA
		So you can shoot a pistol?

			CARAVAGGIO
				(showing his hands)
		No.

			HANA
		If you said yes I would have had a
		reason.  You should let me redress
		those bandages.  Before you go.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house.  We
		needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot
		a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I
		don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.

			HANA
		Because we're fine here.  I don't know
		what Mary told you about me, but I
		don't need company, I don't need
		to be looked at.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Fine.  I'm not looking.


48	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana carries in a tray.  There's OMELETTE on the plate.

			HANA
		There's a man downstairs.  He
		brought us eggs.
				(shows him the omelette)
		He might stay.

			THE PATIENT
		Why?  Can he lay eggs?

			HANA
		He's Canadian.

			THE PATIENT
				(brittle)
		Why are people always so happy when
		they collide with someone from the same
		place?  What happened in Montreal when
		you passed a man in the street - did you
		invite him to live with you?

			HANA
		He needn't disturb you.

			THE PATIENT
		Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.

			HANA
		He won't disturb us then.  I think
		he's after morphine.
				(she's cut the omelette
into tiny pieces)
		There's a war.  Where you come from
		becomes important.  And besides - 
		we're vulnerable here.  I keep hearing
		noises in the night.  Voices.

The Patient says nothing.  She puts a spoonful of the omelette into his 
mouth.  He grunts.


49	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    STAIRS.    DAY.

	Caravaggio is in the shadows on the stairs.  HE LISTENS.


50	EXT.    CAIRO MARKET.    1938.    DAY.

A STREET MARKET in full sway, a locals-only affair, blazing with noise 
and bustle and barter.  Emerging from a thicket of women and begging 
children, KATHARINE CLIFTON carries her purchase of an exotic-looking 
RUG.  From nowhere she is joined by Almásy.

			ALMÁSY
		How much did you pay?

			KATHARINE
				(delighted)
		Hello!  Good morning.

			ALMÁSY
		They don't see foreign women in this
		market.  How much did you pay?

			KATHARINE
		Seven pounds, eight, I suppose.  Why?

			ALMÁSY
		Which stall?

			KATHARINE
		Excuse me?

			ALMÁSY
		You've been cheated, don't worry,
		we'll take it back.

			KATHARINE
				(bristling)
		I don't want to go back.

			ALMÁSY
		This is not worth eight pounds,
		Mrs. Clifton.

			KATHARINE
		I don't care to bargain.

			ALMÁSY
		That insults them.

			KATHARINE
				(turning to face him)
		I don't believe that.  I think you are
		insulted by me, somehow.  You're a
		foreigner too, aren't you, here,
		in this market?

			ALMÁSY
				(of the carpet)
		I should be very happy to obtain
		the correct price for this.  I apologize
		if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at
		social graces.
				(tart)
		How do you find Cairo?  Did you
		visit the Pyramids?

			KATHARINE
		Excuse me.

He stands as she continues, pushing past him, shrugging off the 
children, boiling.


51	INT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

THE LONG BAR.  The Exploration Team are drinking at a table.  They are 
not entirely off-duty - Almásy and Madox as ever ponder the maps.  
Geoffrey Clifton appears, arms waving.

			CLIFTON
		Gentlemen, good evening!

He sits down.   Madox hails the waiter.

			D'AGOSTINO
		How is your charming wife?

			CLIFTON
		Uh, marvelous.  She's in love with
		the hotel plumbing.  She's either in
		the swimming pool - she swims for
		hours, she's a fish, quite incredible -
		or she's in the bath.  Actually,
		she's just outside.
				(responding to their
bewildered expressions)
		Chaps Only in the Long Bar.

			MADOX
				(standing, embarrassed)
		Of course.  Well, we should all go
		out onto the terrace.

			CLIFTON
		Oh no, really.  She has her book.

			MADOX
		I won't hear of it.  None of us will.


52	EXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL TERRACE.    NIGHT.

Katharine appears with Geoffrey to join the arriving Explorers.  She 
looks exquisite in her evening clothes.  Madox brings her to her seat.  
There is dancing inside, and couples walk to and from their tables.  
Katharine manages to produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone 
except Almásy.

			MADOX
		Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive
		us.  We're not accustomed to the
		company of women.

			KATHARINE
		Not at all.  I was thoroughly 
		enjoying by book.
				(indicating they should all sit 
and then nodding at Almásy
before greeting the others)
		Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.

			CLIFTON
		The team is in mourning, darling.

			KATHARINE
		Oh really?

			MADOX
		I'm afraid we're not having much luck
		obtaining funds for the expedition.

			KATHARINE
		How awful.  What will you do?

			MADOX
		A more modest expedition, or even wait a
		year.  Remind our families we still exist.

			CLIFTON
				(astonished)
		Good heavens, are you married, Madox?

			MADOX
		Very much so.  We are all, save my
		friend here.

He nods at Almasy.  Clifton appears tremendously relieved.

			CLIFTON
		I feel much better, don't you darling?
		We were feeling rather self-conscious.
		Let's toast, then.  To absent wives.

			D'AGOSTINO
				(toasting Katharine)
		And present ones.

			KATHARINE
				(toasting Almásy)
		And future ones.


53	INT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    NIGHT.

THE BALLROOM.  A dance finishes.  Almásy takes over from D'Agostino to 
partner Katharine.  They dance beautifully.  The others remain on the 
terrace in deep conversation.

			KATHARINE
		Why did you follow me yesterday?

			ALMÁSY
		Excuse me?

			KATHARINE
		After the market, you followed me
		to the hotel.

			ALMÁSY
		I was concerned.  As I said, women in
		that part of Cairo, a European women,
		I felt obliged to.

			KATHARINE
		You felt obliged to.

			ALMÁSY
		As the wife of one of our party.

			KATHARINE
				(sardonic)
		So why follow me?  Escort me, by
		all means.  Following me is
		predatory, isn't it?

The dance finishes.  They walk back to their table, where Almásy leads 
Katharine back to her seat next to Clifton.

			CLIFTON
		I was just saying, I'm going to cable
		Downing Street, see if I can't stir up
		a few shillings - Katharine's mother
		and the PM's wife are best -

			KATHARINE
				(interrupting)
		Darling, for goodness' sake!

			CLIFTON
		Well, she is!


54*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana, having already replaced the bedlinen, is standing on a stepladder 
trying to hang home-made drapes around the bed as Caravaggio knocks 
tentatively, then comes in.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hello.

			THE PATIENT
		Finally!  So you're our
		Canadian pickpocket?

	He goes to help Hana, they work as he talks.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Thief, I think, is more accurate.

			THE PATIENT
		I understand you were in Africa.
		Whereabouts?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Oh, all over.

			THE PATIENT
		All over?  I kept trying to cover
		a very modest portion and still failed.
				(to Hana)
		Are you leaving us?  Now's our
		opportunity to swap war wounds.

			HANA
		Then I'm definitely going.

And she exits.  The men consider her.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Does she have war wounds?


55*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S ROOM.    DAY.

As Hana walks up her stairs she finds herself overhearing their 
conversation as it threads up through the hole in the ceiling.  She 
strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet.

			THE PATIENT
		I think anybody she ever loves
		tends to die on her.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Are you planning to be the exception?

			THE PATIENT
		Me?  You've got the wrong end of
		the stick, old boy.
				(a pause)
		So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you
		invented your name.

			CARAVAGGIO
		And you've forgotten yours.

			THE PATIENT
		I told her you would never invent
		such a preposterous name.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I told her you can forget everything
		but you never forget your name.


56*.	EXT.    BEACH CABIN.    ITALY.    DAY.    1944.

HANA IS STILL LISTENING BUT NOW SHE'S OUTSIDE A CABIN.  She's in her 
uniform, clearing things away.  The Cabin door is ajar.  An OFFICER 
moves around, then sits to make notes.

			OFFICER (O/S)
		What about your rank or serial number?

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found
		near the wreckage of a plane by the
		Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.

THIS CONVALESCENCE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN FASHIONED FROM A LONG ROW OF 
BATHING CABINS ON THE COAST, complete with Campari Umbrellas and metal 
tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the 
comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted conversation.  Hana 
walks up to the Patient's cabin.  He is propped up with a view of the 
sea, which is interrupted by the pacing Officer.  Hana has a blanket 
and a chart for the Patient's bed.  She busies herself.

			OFFICER
		Do you remember where you were born?

			THE PATIENT
		Am I being interrogated?  You should be
		trying to trick me.  Ask me about
		Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace.
		About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make
		me speak German, which I can, by the way.

			OFFICER
		Why?  Are you German?

			THE PATIENT
		No.  

			OFFICER
		How do you know you're not German if
		you don't remember anything?

			THE PATIENT
		You tell me.  I remember a lot of things.
		I remember a garden, plunging down to
		the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called
		it - and there was a cottage at the
		bottom, right on the shore, nothing
		between you and France.

			OFFICER
		This was your garden?

			THE PATIENT
		Or my wife's.

			OFFICER
		Then you were married?

			THE PATIENT
		I think so.  Although I believe that
		to be true of a number of Germans.
		Might I have a glass of water?

Hana pours him a glass of water.  He notices her.

			THE PATIENT
		Thank you.
				(he sips)
		Look - my lungs are useless -
				(makes a small gap with
his fingers)
		I've got this much lung...the rest
		of my organs are packing up -
		what could it possibly matter if I
		were Tutankhamun?  I'm a bit of
		toast, my friend - butter me and
		slip a poached egg on top.

Hana leaves, smiling at the Patient's irascibility, sharing this with 
the Officer, who frowns.  The interview continues.


57	EXT.    BEACH CABIN.    DAY.

Hana walks between the cabins.  STUART steps out of the shade.  He is 
drawn, older than last seen.

			STUART
		My leave is canceled.  I can't
		meet you later.

Hana frowns, helpless.  As if to emphasize this, a Staff Nurse comes 
by, carrying a bowl and a withering look.


58*.	INT.    BEACH CABIN.    DAY.

 Hana enters, approaches the Patient.  She's circumspect.

			HANA
		Excuse me -

			THE PATIENT
		Yes?

			HANA
		Can I ask - my friend, can he come in?
		Just for a few minutes?

			THE PATIENT
		Your friend?

			HANA
		He's going back to the front this
		evening.  I can't see him otherwise.

			THE PATIENT
		Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.

			HANA
		No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't 
		offended, it would be very good of you 
		to allow us - every other cabin is crammed.
		This is as private as we'll get.

			THE PATIENT
		Well then - yes.  Of course.

			HANA
		Thank you.  Thank you.

She hurries out, returns with Stuart.  They stand awkwardly.

			HANA
		This is Captain McGann.

			THE PATIENT
		Please, don't waste your time on
		pleasantries -

			STUART
		Thanks.

			THE PATIENT
		I'm going to sing.  If I sing I shan't
		hear anything.

And with that he bursts into a raucous, coughing version of Yes! We 
Have No Bananas.  He changes language each verse.  The couple stand, 
formal, then edge round to the back of the bed.

			HANA
				(touching his lip)
		You've got a mustache.

			STUART
		A bit of one.

			HANA
		I was looking forward to this evening.

			STUART
				(whispers)
		I had a hotel room.

			HANA 
				(whispers)
		I thought that was for when we
		were very very old?

			STUART
		I'm feeling old.

They EMBRACE, fiercely, hardly making a sound, or moving.  THE PATIENT 
ROARS THE SONG.


59*.	EXT.   THE MONASTERY.   HANA'S GARDEN.   MORNING.

A battered open backed TRUCK comes into the Monastery.  An ITALIAN 
PARTISAN sits in the back, a SHOTGUN resting on his knees.  The truck 
stops, and Caravaggio emerges from the passenger door.  He collects 
some packages from the PARTISAN, including a dead RABBIT, and then 
exchanges a few words with the driver.  Hana, who's watching all of 
this from her garden, sees that the driver is a WOMAN.  The woman's 
name is GIOIA, and Caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye 
to her.

Caravaggio approaches the Vegetable Garden as Hana comes to greet him.  
He throws her the rabbit, and hurries up the stairs without pausing, 
clutching the other boxes.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Supper.

Hana calls after him.

			HANA
		Where've you been?

			CARAVAGGIO
				(not stopping)
		Rabbit hunting.

Hana looks at the rabbit.  She's angry.  Caravaggio hasn't been around 
for a week.


60*.	INT.  THE MONASTERY.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  DAY.

Hana heads up for the kitchen, then stops as there's a faint CRASH from 
upstairs.


61*.	INT.   THE MONASTERY.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.   DAY.

Hana, the rabbit still in her hands, comes along the corridor to find 
Caravaggio SLUMPED on the floor, retching.  The discarded NEEDLE lies 
beside him, the new package of MORPHINE CAPSULES ripped open.  He looks 
up at Hanna, glazed.

			HANA
		I could help you.  I could
		get you off that.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Can you cook the rabbit or will you
		try and bring that back to life?

She bends, starts clearing up, putting the morphine phials back into 
the box.

			HANA
		It's a week.  We didn't know where you
		were - or if you coming back, or -

			CARAVAGGIO
				(of the drugs)
		You should be happy.  What were you
		going to do for him when it ran out?

He pulls out more phials from his jacket.

			HANA
		What do you do?  What are you doing here?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Some gave me a dress.
				(starts to tear at a parcel)
		You know what's great?  What I'm learning?
		You win a war and you not only gain the
		miles you get the moral ground.
		Everywhere I go, we're in the right.
		I like that.


62*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana comes in, carrying a batch of the new morphine.  She's wearing a 
different FROCK.  It's not new, and it's faded, but the change of color 
is startling.

			THE PATIENT
		Something smells so rich.  My
		stomach is heaving -

			HANA
		He came back, he says he caught a
		rabbit.  I'm cooking it.

			THE PATIENT
		That's a different dress.

			HANA
		He keeps asking me questions about you.
		Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?

			THE PATIENT
		Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is.
		I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read
		Italian.  He can catch rabbits.


63*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

Almásy squats with an ANCIENT ARAB outside his rudimentary house, while 
he draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a 
possible location for the lost oasis.  The man stops speaking and 
scours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint noise 
of a PLANE.  It's Clifton's Steerman, Rupert Bear, coming in to land.  
Almasy doesn't look up.

The Arab continues to talk.  The newly-arrived Katharine has scrambled 
up the hill to speak to Almásy.

			KATHARINE
				(diffident)
		Hello.  Not to interrupt but
		we're celebrating.

She makes to leave but Almásy puts up a hand to keep Katharine there, 
but quiet.

			ALMÁSY
		This is an incredible story - about a man
		hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me
		about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there,
		but his map, the route he's describing,
		he couldn't survive the journey now, but
		he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and
		now we're onto an Ostrich.
				(to the Arab in ARABIC)
		I'm telling her your map is poetry.

The Arab shrugs.

			KATHARINE
		What do you mean, poetry?

			ALMÁSY
		A mountain curved like a woman's back, 
		a plateau the shape of an ear.

			KATHARINE
		Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does
		the Ostrich come in?

			ALMÁSY
		The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts
		an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do
		with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must
		appear not to move.  The man finds a place
		where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands
		where the ostrich can see him, on the
		horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat -
		otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall,
		he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the
		ostrich comes the next day, the man is
		there, but he's nearer.
				(to the guide)
		Haunting the ostrich.

The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family,
		not just the meat, but by selling the 
		feathers, beak, the skin, a year from
		this one animal.  So, each day the
		man gets closer.  And the ostrich is
		not sure - has something changed? -
		now the standing man is only a few
		yards from where it feeds.  And then
		one day, the man is in the wadi, in
		the water.  And the Ostrich comes, as
		always, dips into the water and the
		man JUMPS UP - and captures it.

He shrugs.  The Arab has more to say.  Almásy doesn't respond, quieting 
him with a dismissive gesture.

			KATHARINE
		What is he saying?
				(Almasy, awkward, shakes his head)
		Come on, what did he say?

			ALMÁSY
		He said - be careful.

			KATHARINE
		Be careful?  You mean you - or me?  Who?

			ALMÁSY
				(to the Arab)
		Her or me?

The Arab speaks again.  Almasy speaks without looking at her.

			ALMÁSY
		The one who appears not to be moving.


64*.	INT.    TENT.   BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.

Katharine comes in.  Then, a beat, and Almásy.  Clifton is holding up 
the champagne.  

			CLIFTON
		Gentlemen, to Zerzura.

			ALL
		Zerzura.

			MADOX
		And a special thank you to Geoffrey
		and Katharine, without whose
		fund-raising heroics we should 
		still be kicking our heels.

They toast the Cliftons.

			CLIFTON
		To arm-twisting.

			MADOX
				(to Almásy)
		Did Katharine say? - 
		Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.

			CLIFTON
		Have to return the favor - take a few
		photographs for the army.

			KATHARINE
		Darling, Peter says I could stay...

			MADOX
				(checking with Almásy)
		Why not?

			ALMÁSY
		What kind of photographs?

			CLIFTON
		Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's
		wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier
		at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.

			KATHARINE
				(to Clifton)
		Why do you think?  About my staying?

			CLIFTON
		Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then
		I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft...

			KATHARINE
				(playfully poking his ribs)
		Oh.

			CLIFTON
		But finally able to explore the Cairo
		night-life.  I shall produce an
		authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars
		and - I want to say Harems - am I in
		the right country for Harems?


65*.	EXT.     BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    MORNING.

As Clifton prepares to leave in the Steerman, Almásy approaches.

			ALMÁSY
		Safe journey.

			CLIFTON
		You too.  Good luck!

			ALMÁSY
		Clifton - your wife - do you think
		it's appropriate to leave her?

			CLIFTON
		Appropriate?

			ALMÁSY
		I think the desert is, it's - for a
		woman - it's very tough, I wonder 
		if it's not too much for her.

			CLIFTON
		Are you mad?  Katharine loves it
		here. She told me yesterday.

			ALMÁSY
		All the same, I, were I you I would
		be concerned -

			CLIFTON
		I've known Katharine since she was
		three, my aunt is her aunt, we were
		practically brother and sister before
		we were man and wife.  I think I'd
		know what is and what isn't too much
		for her.  I think she's know herself.

			ALMÁSY
		Very well.

			CLIFTON
				(laughing it off)
		Why are you people so threatened 
		by a woman?!

He settles into the controls.  Almásy watches the plane taxi away.  
Doesn't move at all.  Katharine waves from the tent as the Steerman 
takes off.


65a*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.

The THREE FORD CARS leave the campsite, loaded for a scouting 
expedition.  The rest of the party, Bedouin, tents, camels and Tiger 
Moth is left behind.  Madox shouts last-minute instructions from the 
window of his car.


66*.	EXT.    DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

FENELON-BARNES sits astride his camel, and wipes away the sweat.  The 
desert stretches for miles, shimmering, the sun baking the sand.  His 
GUIDES wind their headcloths tighter.  Nobody speaks.  Then one of them 
looks round, raises a hand.  A BUZZING noise.  They all turn.  A SMALL 
CLOUD OF DUST EMERGES OVER A RIDGE.  Locusts?  A sandstorm?

A CARAVAN OF CARS, the Almásy/Madox expedition, bumps along, 
suspensions threatened by the constant dips and ridges.  On each car 
there are three in the passenger cabin, the open backs crammed with 
drums of gasoline and water and equipment.  On the front vehicle, the 
tenth member of the party, KAMAL, acts as a navigator and sits on a 
CAMEL SADDLE, a rodeo cowboy, on the roof of the leading car, driven by 
Madox.  As they spot FENELON-BARNES they sound their horns and wave 
good-naturedly.  F-B scowls, watches them roar by, stealing his 
thunder.


66a*.	EXT.  DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   DAY.

ONE OF THE CARS IS HOPELESSLY BOGGED DOWN IN HEAVY SAND.  It's contents 
have been unloaded, and a rope ladder is being inserted under the 
tires.  The entire company huff and puff and argue about the best means 
of extricating the vehicle.


67*.	INT.    CAR EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

LATER - Almásy drives the second car, accompanied by Katharine and Al 
Auf.  Katharine breaks the long silence.

			KATHARINE
		I've been thinking about - how does
		somebody like you decide to come to
		the desert?  What is it?  You're doing
		whatever you're doing - in your castle,
		or wherever it is you live, and one day,
		you say, I have to go to the desert - or what?

Almásy doesn't answer.  Katharine, who has looked at him for an answer, 
looks away.  There's another long silence.

			ALMÁSY
		I once traveled with a terrific guide,
		who was taking me to Faya.  He didn't
		speak for nine hours.  At the end of
		it he pointed at the horizon and 
		said - Faya!  That was a good day!

Point made, they lapse again into silence.  Katharine boils.

			KATHARINE
		Actually, you sing.

			ALMÁSY
		Pardon?

			KATHARINE
		You sing.  All the time.

			ALMÁSY
		I do not.

			KATHARINE
		Ask Al Auf.

Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.  He laughs, nods.

			KATHARINE
				(sings wickedly)
		I'll be down to get you in the taxi,
		honey, you'd better be ready about
		half-past eight...!

Al Auf nods and grins furiously, joins in, impersonating Almásy.  
Almásy grunts in irritation.


68*.	EXT.  NEAR THE BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  DUSK.

The group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif.  They climb 
slowly.  Below them, A NEW AND TEMPORARY BASE CAMP.

The group winds around the rock.  Almásy turns to offer a hand to 
Katharine behind him, pulling her up to the next rock slab.  She smiles 
at him.  He smiles back curtly, continues.

The group stops at a level plateau.  The Arabs stand apart and SING 
THEIR PRAYERS AT DUSK.  Al Auf leads the incantations.

			AL AUF
		Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar...

The westerners wait respectfully.  As the sun sets in glory, Almásy 
looks over at the range of rocks.  One particular range seems to look 
exactly like A WOMAN'S BACK.  He squints at the rock.  Almásy 
discreetly pulls out his COMPASS.


69*.	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DUSK.

Almásy clambers up the rocks, coming through a narrow crevice to find A 
NATURAL SHELF.  He scrambles up this path, reaching up, only to notice 
that his hand almost perfectly covers A PAINTED HAND on the rock, and 
as he digests this he realizes he has climbed past what is THE MOUTH OF 
A CAVE.  He disappears inside.


70	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

A FLASHLIGHT squirts into the cave.  Almásy treads cautiously along the 
narrow winding passage.  He comes to an open cavern and takes his 
flashlight up to a wall.  PAINTINGS EMERGE, figures, animals,  ancient 
pictures.  A giraffe.  Cattle.  Fish.  Men with bows and arrows.  
Almásy is astonished by what he sees.


71*.	EXT.    NEAR THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    EVENING.

The others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks as 
Almásy comes scrambling down, transformed into an excited teenager.

			ALMÁSY
		Madox!  Madox!

He slithers in a heap in front of the astonished expedition party.  
Doesn't care.


72	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

Almásy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave.  Now Madox 
comes alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining Almásy's and 
increasing the visibility of the paintings.  A dark-skinned figure, 
apparently in the process of DIVING into water, comes clearly into 
view.  Then others supine, arms outstretched.

			MADOX
				(with audible excitement)
		My God, they're swimming!

The others crowd round.  FIVE EXCITED FACES IN THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE 
CAVE.


73*.	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

A hive of activity.  The team has set up TRESTLES to catalogue the 
finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of detritus, which they 
empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is cleared out.  Entering the 
cave, Almásy passes with camera equipment, just as D'Ag emerges 
carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved DESERT FOX.  D'Ag gestures 
to Almasy with his customary enthusiasm, holding up the body of the 
fox.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Have you seen this?  Astonishing.
		Perfectly preserved.


74	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Inside, Bermann is setting up LAMPS, running wires from a car BATTERY.  
Kamal is helping him.  And as Almásy arrives he catches a tiny moment 
of tenderness between them.  Bermann, seeing him, quickly disengages 
and busies himself with the lights.  At another wall, Katharine is 
catching.


75	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

The CARS are heading back to Basecamp.  They bounce over the sand.


76*.	INT.    BERMANN'S CAR.    DAY.

Bermann is driving the lead CAR along some STEEP DUNES.  Almásy beside 
him.  Bermann is peeling AN ORANGE, a segment of which he holds out of 
the window.  Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and collects it, his 
head dipping in to grin at Bermann.  Bermann looks uneasily as Almásy.  
He wants to tell him of his passion, of his absolute love for Kamal, 
but he daren't.

			BERMANN
		I love the desert, you see.  That's my,
		that's my - I can't think of the word.
				(Almásy nods)
		How do you explain?  To someone who's
		never been here?  Feelings which seem
		quite normal.

			ALMÁSY
				(compassionate)
		I don't know, my friend.  I don't know.

Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim 
brown hand collect it.  A MOMENTARY DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM 
TO MISJUDGE THE LINE AND SUDDENLY THE DUNE COLLAPSES UNDER THE TIRE AND 
THE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE.  D'Ag - following, 
Fouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can't stop his own car from 
being caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND 
INTO BERMANN'S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS CRUNCH, the radiator 
exploding.  Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a little way behind, 
manages to stay clear of the trouble.  He jumps out of the vehicle and 
slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out 
of the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the 
wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of 
oil spreading ominously.


77*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
 
LATER and the group have cleaned up as best as possible.  D'Ag, 
Bermann, and Fouad are a little worse for wear.  Fouad's arm is in a 
sling, and D'Ag is sporting a bloody head-bandage.  Bermann has broken 
a finger and is being attended to by Madox.  The luggage, water and 
petrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining 
car.  Almásy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle.  He's 
having no success.


78*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

Almásy, Kamal and two of the other young Bedouin stand around the mess 
of the two broken vehicles.  The ONE WORKING CAR is loaded with men and 
provisions.  Katharine sits inside, next to Madox, Almásy comes over to 
her window, to speak past her to Madox.

			MADOX
		I'll be back as quick as I can.  
		Thirty-six hours at the outside.

			ALMÁSY
		Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury
		it between here and the Pottery Hill.
		And a better jack.  We planned badly.

			MADOX
				(nods at Almásy, then shouts over 
to the wrecked vehicles)
		Bermann!

This is Bermann's cue to take leave of Kamal who is staying behind.  
Kamal makes a little bow.

			KAMAL
		May God make safety your companion.

Bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car which jolts off, 
bouncing over the track.

THE VEHICLE GETS ABOUT TWENTY YARDS, ALMASY WATCHING, BEFORE IT SINKS 
FORLORNLY INTO THE SOFT SAND.  IT'S HOPELESSLY OVERLOADED WITH PEOPLE.  
THEY ALL GET OUT.

			KATHARINE
		I shall stay behind, of course

			MADOX
		Certainly not.

			KATHARINE
		I insist.  There clearly isn't room for
		us all, I'm the least able to dig, and 
		I'm not one of the walking wounded.
		Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain
		it's the most effective method of
		persuading my husband to abandon
		whatever he's doing and rescue us.

It's hard to argue with this logic.  Almásy shrugs.

LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure.  And Almasy and 
Katharine are left alone.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this 
for the first time.  Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged 
vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent 
TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS.  Katharine goes to 
join them.  There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles 
of undulating dunes.


79	INT.    SHELTER.    DAY.

Almásy sits alone, writing into HIS HERODOTUS, a map folded in front of 
him, from which he makes notes.  Katherine comes across with a clutch 
of her SKETCHES from the Cave wall.  Hands them to him.  They're 
beautiful.

			ALMÁSY
		What's this?

			KATHARINE
		I thought you might paste them
		into your book.

			ALMÁSY
		We took several photographs,
		there's no need.

			KATHARINE
		I'd like you to have them.

			ALMÁSY
				(handing them back)
		There's really no need.  This is
		just a scrapbook.  I should feel
		obliged.  Thank you.

			KATHARINE
				(exasperated)
		And that would be unconscionable,
		I suppose, to feel any obligation?  
		Yes.  Of course it would.

She's already turning, walking as far from him as the cramped shelter 
permits.  He continues with his maps.


80	EXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune, smoking, surveying the 
landscape.  Below her the makeshift camp - a fresh wind flicking at the 
tarpaulin, THE DEEP TRACKS OF MADOX'S CAR STRETCHING OFF TOWARDS 
CIVILIZATION.  Almásy emerges from the tent and, locating Katharine, 
heads towards her.

			ALMÁSY
		You should come into the shelter.

			KATHARINE
		I'm quite all right, thank you.

			ALMÁSY
		Look over there.

Katharine turns, scans the horizon.

			KATHARINE
		What am I looking at?

			ALMÁSY
		See what's happening to them -
		the stars.

			KATHARINE
		They're so untidy.  I'm just trying 
		to rearrange them.

			ALMÁSY
		In an hour there will be no stars.
		The air is filling with sand.

He offers a hand.  A little reluctantly she takes it.


81	EXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

The team hurries around the improvised tent, weighing it down with 
packing cases, gasoline drums, water cans, bringing anything loose or 
light inside the tarpaulin.  THE WIND is whipping up, the air busy with 
sand.  Almásy pushes everyone under cover.


82	INT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

THE SAND SEEMS TO BE SCOURING THE TARPAULIN.  Kamal and Almásy try to 
secure one vulnerable area, but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and 
the sand swarms inside.

It's noisy, too, and Almásy has to shout to make himself understood, 
indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and blankets and food, all the 
valuables, and get out.  He himself finds blankets and water and shouts 
at Katharine to do the same.  One side of the canvas suddenly RIPS 
apart like paper. Chaos as figures struggle in ever-worsening 
conditions, sand blizzarding the air.


83	EXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

THE SHELTER FLIES INTO THE AIR, stranding the figures, their heads 
wrapped in blankets, flashlights useless.  They seek safety in two 
groups, the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and 
Almásy to the upright one.


84	INT.    CAR.    NIGHT.

Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and Almásy 
sit without speaking.  Dawn is trying to break through.  He pours a 
little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses 
and mouths.  She takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it, 
then dries his.

			KATHARINE
		This is not very good, is it?

			ALMÁSY
		No.

			KATHARINE
		Shall we be all right?

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  Absolutely.

			KATHARINE
		Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.


85	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAWN.

The sand is piling up against the two cars, the tent is swept from its 
moorings, the water cans are hurled up too, and then plunge ominously 
into sand drifts as if going under an ocean.

			ALMÁSY (O/S)
		...let me tell you about winds.  There
		is a whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the 
		Aajej, against which the fellahin defend
		themselves with knives.  The Ghibli from
		Tunis rolls and rolls and produces a 
		rather strange nervous condition...

And we hear Katharine's laugh.


86	INT.    CAR.    DAWN.

Almasy sits alongside Katharine, whose head is against his shoulder.  
He continues his story of winds.

			ALMÁSY
		#NAME?
		Which Mariners called the sea of
		darkness.  Red sand from this wind
		has flown as far as the south coast
		of England, producing showers so
		dense they were mistaken for blood.

Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.

			KATHARINE
		Fiction.  We had a house on that coast
		and it never rained blood.  Go on.  More.

			ALMÁSY
		All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells
		of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a
		nation declared war on it and marched
		out to fight it in full battle dress, 
		their swords raised.


87*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

MORNING.  The sand has almost COMPLETELY ENGULFED the car on the 
exposed side, covering the windshield like snow, and encroaching onto 
the door of the protected flank.


88*.	INT.    CAR.    DAY.

Almásy is woken by sound of A DISTANT ENGINE.  He jerks up, waking 
Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door.  He can't open 
it, and has to lean his feet against the passenger door, lying across 
Katharine, kicking it open.


89*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

By the time Almásy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the 
cabin, MADOX'S CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE HORIZON.  Almásy waves, shouts, 
and then runs back into the car, finds his flare-gun, and SENDS A FLARE 
high into the sky.  Katharine is with him now, and they watch, 
helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a 
mission.  Katharine panics, THE SAND HAS ERASED ALL TRACES OF THEM.  
She speaks quietly, shocked.

			KATHARINE
		Our tracks, where are they?

Almásy is preoccupied.  He's gone back to their vehicle and returns 
with a shovel, STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY.

			ALMÁSY
		Madox will have calculated how many
		miles, they'll soon turn around.

			KATHARINE
				(realizing what he's doing)
		Oh my God, the others!

She kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand WHICH HAS 
COMPLETELY ENGULFED THE OTHER VEHICLE containing the three Bedouin.

			ALMÁSY
				(during this)
		Could I ask you, please, to paste you
		paintings into my book?  I should like
		to have them.  I should be honored.

			KATHARINE
		Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible
		coward to ask how much water we have?

			ALMÁSY
				(shoveling hard)
		Water?  Yes, we have water, we have
		a little in our can, we have water in
		the radiator which can be drunk.  Not
		at all cowardly, extremely practical.
				(anxious at not uncovering
the boys, egging himself on)
		Come on, come on!
				(then back to Katharine)
		There's also a plant - I've never seen
		it but I'm told you can cut a piece the
		size of a heart from this plant and
		the next day it will be filled with a
		delicious liquid.

			KATHARINE
		Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.

They hear NOISES, scrabbling, faint thumps.  Almásy scrapes at the sand 
and they find the glass of the car.  The angle of the cab, tilted up to 
the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open.  
Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating.  Almásy pulls the door and it 
cranks open.


90*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus.  
It's full of ALMÁSY'S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME PRESSED FLOWERS.  
She deciphers a page of his words and drawings.  It's almost 
exclusively about her, the lines studded with K.s.  She reads, 
astonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle 
the area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners, 
like Kip searches for mines.  Kamal is slumped against the front of the 
car.  He's sick.  Almásy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to 
shovel into the sand.  He pulls out A CAN OF WATER.  Turns to Katharine 
and holds it triumphantly in the air.


91*.	INT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

There's a small, weak fire.  The group crouch around it.  The boys talk 
noisily to Almásy.  Kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering.  
Almásy gives him water, speaks to Katherine.

			ALMÁSY
		Kamal is passing blood.  He must have
		had some internal damage in the crash.
		He needs medicine.  I think we must risk
		the other flare.

He gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge.  
This time the effect is dramatic with A RED UMBRELLA OF LIGHT.  
Katharine comes up beside him.  They wait, hope fading with the flare.

			KATHARINE
				(blank)
		Geoffrey's not in Cairo.
				(Almásy looks at her)
		He's not actually a buffoon.  And
		the plane wasn't a wedding
		present.  It belongs to the British
		Government.  They want aerial
		maps of the whole North Africa.
		So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In
		case you were counting on his 
		sudden appearance.

			ALMÁSY
		And the marriage - is that a fiction?

There's a beat.  Katharine has a hundred answers.

			KATHARINE
		No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark.  
Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, AN ANSWERING FLARE 
fireworks into the sky.

			KATHARINE
		Thank God.  Oh, thank God.

There's excited shouting from the two fit boys.  They leap up and run 
towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not 
come from Madox, but from an approaching CAMEL CARAVAN.  Almásy shouts 
to the boys for some identification.

			KATHARINE
		Do they know them?

			ALMÁSY
				(squinting at the horizon)
		No, but I think I do.

The Caravan slowly comes into focus.  IT'S FENELON-BARNES.  Katharine 
touches Almásy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture.

			KATHARINE
		Am I K. in your book?  
		I think I must be.

Almásy turns to her.  He runs the blade of his arm across her neck - 
the sweat leaving a clear stripe.

Fenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses 
Almásy.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I recollect your saying to ignore
		your bones but I assume you have
		no objection to my rescuing your
		companion?
				(to Katharine)
		Good evening, Mrs. Clifton.

			KATHARINE
				(accepting his handshake)
		Hello.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'd like to introduce you to my camel -
		the most notable beast on earth.
				(to Almásy)
		I understand you found some
		remarkable caves.

A goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine.  She drinks and hands 
it to Almásy.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Paintings of swimmers?  Remarkable.


92	EXT.    CAIRO.    DAY.

ANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing Almásy and Katharine 
negotiates the incredible bustle of Cairo.


93	EXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.

Almásy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from 
the cab, and pulls Katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds 
open the door for her.  As she walks towards the hotel, he hands her 
bag to a porter.  Katharine is stung.

			KATHARINE
		Will you not come in?

			ALMÁSY
		No.

			KATHARINE
		Will you please come in?

			ALMÁSY
				(a beat)
		Mrs. Clifton -

	Katharine turns, disgusted.

			KATHARINE
		Don't.  

			ALMÁSY
		I believe you still have my book.

Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then 
disappears.


94	INT.    ALMÁSY'S ROOM.    DAY.

Almásy lying on a camp bed, face down.  The walls are covered with 
maps, enlargements of photographs.  A fan whirs over his kit which is 
spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor.  An ineffably male 
room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing 
the gloom.  Almásy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked 
off below his jutting feet.  

There's A KNOCK at the door.  Almásy sleeps.  Another.  A third.  He's 
roused from the dead.  Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the 
knocking continues.

It's Katharine.  She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the 
afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress.  She walks past him into 
the room.  He closes the door.  She turns.  He KNEELS before her, head 
at her thighs.  She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go 
to his head.

			KATHARINE
		You still have sand in your hair.

She starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders, violently.  He pulls 
back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face.  She kneels 
and covers his face with kisses.  He pulls blindly at her dress and it 
RIPS across her breasts.


95*.	INT.    BATHROOM.    DAY.

Almásy is in the bath.  Katharine, wearing his dressing gown, pours in 
a jug of steaming water.  Almásy leans over the rim of the bath.  He's 
sewing, carefully repairing the torn dress.

			KATHARINE
		I'm impressed you can sew.

			ALMÁSY
		Good.

			KATHARINE
		You sew very badly.

			ALMÁSY
		You don't sew at all!

			KATHARINE
		A woman should never learn to sew,
		and if she can she should never
		admit to it.  Close your eyes.

			ALMÁSY
				(laughs)
		That makes it harder still.

She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head, 
then begins to shampoo his hair.

Almásy is in heaven.  The biggest smile we have seen from him.  She 
continues to massage his scalp.

			ALMÁSY
		When were you most happy?

			KATHARINE
		Now.

			ALMÁSY
		When were you least happy?

			KATHARINE
				(a beat)
		Now.

			ALMÁSY
		Okay.  And what do you love?
		Say everything.

			KATHARINE
		What do I love?  I love rice pudding,
		and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs!
		The gardens at our house in Freshwater -
		all my secret paths.

She rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN BESIDE HIM, 
covering his neck and shoulders in kisses.

			ALMÁSY
		What else?

			KATHARINE
		Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not
		with other people!  Islands.  Your
		handwriting.  I could go on all day.
				(a beat)
		My husband.

	Almásy nods.

			ALMÁSY
		What do you hate most?

			KATHARINE
		A lie.  What do you hate most?

			ALMÁSY
		Ownership.  Being owned.  When
		you leave, you should forget me.

She freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then 
SLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face.

She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and 
walks, dripping, out of the room.


96*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

To the Patient it's as if Katharine is walking out of his wall.  He 
sighs with pain, then looks away to where Hana has fallen asleep on the 
bed, almost on top of him.  He touches her.   He speaks as if each word 
burns him.

			THE PATIENT
		Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry -
		but when you turn, the sheets, I can't
		really bear the sheets moving over me.  
		Sorry.

			HANA
				(mortified, moving quickly)
		Yes, of course, I'm so sorry.
		Stupid of me.

	Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.

			HANA
		I'm so sorry.


97*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Hana comes to the table, carrying a jug of water and a bowl.   She's 
still sad.  She unbuttons her dress, pulling it off her shoulder, 
begins to pour the water to cool herself against the night's pressing 
heat.


98*.	EXT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.   1944.    LATE DAY.

The EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL is a cluster of tents practically ahead of 
the Front Line SPORADIC GUN FIRE, LIGHT AND HEAVY, SOUNDS THROUGHOUT.  
Mary walks by on her way to the Nurse's tent.  It's 1944 and the war in 
Italy is still intense.


99	INT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL TENT.    LATE DAY.

JAN is washing out of her HELMET, and stands naked in her socks.  Hana 
is using a flannel to wash Jan's back.  A couple of other girls like, 
exhausted, on their cots.  The mud is everywhere.  Another nurse is 
making tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus.

MARY comes in and flops down.  She's GIVEN BLOOD and is pale and 
enervated.

			MARY
		Okay, Type Os, the vampires wait.
		Everybody's giving a pint.

			JAN
		Ugh!  If they were sucking it out
		I wouldn't mind.  It's the needle
		I can't stand.

			HANA
				(laughing)
		You're a nurse - how ca you be
		frightened of needles!


100	INT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.

Hana walks through the main TRIAGE TENT.  It's packed with the ruined 
bodies of the injured, swaddled in bloody bandages.  Hana stops at a 
couple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients.  She stops at 
another bed, leans over its occupant.  His bandaged face is bloated and 
yellow.  He's not breathing.  She bends over him, his open eyes fixed 
in a glassy stare.  No pulse.  She snaps the triangular cardboard ID 
from his bed to indicate HE'S DIED.  Then tenderly closes his eyes.  
THEY SUDDENLY SNAP OPEN.  HE REARS UP, GRABBING HER.

			WOUNDED SOLDIER
		Can't wait to have me dead?  You bitch!

He slaps her hand away.  Slaps at the tubes going into his arm.  Hana 
is absolutely shocked.  But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi-
consciousness.

Shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes 
it again.  He is in terrible pain.  His face creased with anger.  Now 
his hand is clutching at hers.  She tries to soothe him.

			HANA
		Try t be calm.  Ssssshhh.  Come on.
		Be calm now.  Ssshhhh.  Be peaceful.
		It's okay.  It's okay.

HIS FACE STILLS.  HIS HAND LOOSENS.  Now he has gone.  As Hana inspects 
him, a shell seems to land close by.  THE LIGHTS FLICKER.  She ducks, 
along with everyone else.

Below the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's 
possessions.  They include A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES.


101	INT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  EVENING.

HANA, WEARING THE TENNIS SHOES, IS GIVING BLOOD.  She lies in a cot, 
next to JAN.  The shelling sounds closer.

OLIVER, the Doctor, is working on the most recent patient, a young 
CANADIAN Boy who is critically ill - the tubes hanging above him, of 
plasma and of blood.  The curtain drawn around him is pulled back, to 
reveal the two nurses in the background.  The Soldier can just see 
them.  He's going to die any minute.  

			CANADIAN SOLDIER
				(whispering to Oliver)
		Is there anybody here from Picton?

			OLIVER
		Picton?  I don't know.

			CANADIAN SOLDIER
		I'd like to see somebody from home
		before I go.

Hana can only really hear Oliver's end of this conversation, but the 
mention of Canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that 
Stuart is dead.

			HANA 
				(to Oliver)
		Why Picton?

			OLIVER
		He's from there - edge of Lake
		Ontario right, Soldier?

The boy nods.

			JAN 
				(innocent)
		Where's your Stuart from?
		Somewhere near there, isn't it?

			HANA
				(to Oliver)
		As him what company he's with?

Oliver leans over, then turns to Hana.

			OLIVER
		Third Canadian Fusiliers.

			HANA
		Does he know a Captain McGann?

The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.

			CANADIAN SOLDIER
		He bought it.  Yesterday.  Shot to bits.

The shells are getting closer.

			HANA
		What did he say?

			OLIVER
				(can't look at her)
		Doesn't know him.

A SHELL SUDDENLY LANDS ON TOP OF THE SITE, PERHAPS FIFTY YARDS FROM THE 
TENT.  THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  THEN ANOTHER LANDS.

Everybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet.

Hana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on.  Oliver is 
next to her in the mud.  Her heart is breaking.

			HANA
		He's gone, hasn't he?

			OLIVER
		No.  He's - no.

			HANA
		Oh God.  Oh God.

The shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but 
each explosion illuminates it for a moment.


102	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Caravaggio comes into the kitchen.  Hana is slumped at the table, her 
back naked.  The jug of water in front of her.  She's sobbing, her 
shoulders heaving.  Caravaggio approaches tentatively.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hana?
				(he touches her shoulder)
		Hana?  Are you alright?

			HANA
				(without raising her head)
		Don't touch me if you're going to
		try and fuck me.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(soothing)
		I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.

She reaches for her blouse, wraps it around herself.  Her face is read 
with weeping.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(gently)
		You have to protect yourself from 
		sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.
				(drinking the water)
		You're in love with him, aren't you?
		Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint
		or something?  Because of the way he 
		looks?  I don't think he is.

			HANA
		I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love
		with ghosts.  And so is he.  He's in
		love with ghosts.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Who are his ghosts?

			HANA
		Ask him.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(he holds up his hands)
		What if I told you he did this to me?

			HANA
				(stung)
		What?  How could he have?  When?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't
		even know.  It's like he slammed a
		door in Cairo and it trapped my 
		fucking hands in Tobruk.

			HANA
		I don't know what that means.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(shrugs)
		Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is.
		Ask him who he's killed.

			HANA
				(furious)
		Please don't creep around this house.


103*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana sits reading from the Herodotus.  She shows the Patient the page 
where a CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER covered in handwriting has been glued 
in.

			HANA
		Tell me about this, this is in your
		handwriting - December 22nd -
		Betrayals in war are childlike 
		compared with our betrayals during
		peace.  New lovers are nervous and
		tender, but smash everything - for
		the heart is an organ of fire...
				(she looks up)
		I love that, I believe that.
				(to him)
		Who is K?

			THE PATIENT
		K is for Katharine.


104	EXT.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, DECEMBER 1938.  DAY.

A CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR THE TROOPS.  The incongruous attempts to create a 
traditional Christmas in the dusty heat of Cairo.  

The Party is in the courtyard of the Moorish Palace which serves as the 
private residence of the British Ambassador, SIR RONNIE HAMPTON.  Lots 
of Wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine help serve tea and cake 
to the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and 
paper hats.  A man dressed as SANTA CLAUS is giving out presents - 
PENGUIN PAPERBACKS, CHOCOLATE.  Music blares out from a loudspeaker.  
Officers and Civilians walk the parameter.  One of these, arriving, is 
Almasy.  He sits in the shade, catches Katharine's attention.  
Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with Christmas cake 
on it.

			ALMÁSY
		Say you're sick.

			KATHARINE
		What?  No!

			ALMÁSY
		Say you're feeling faint - the sun.

			KATHARINE
				(but a frisson)
		No.

			ALMÁSY
		I can't work.  I can't sleep.

Lady Hampton calls impatiently.

			LADY HAMPTON
		Katharine!

			KATHARINE
		Coming.
				(to Almásy)
		I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting
		in the middle of the night.  Geoffrey
		thinks it's the thing in the desert,
		the trauma.

			ALMÁSY
		I can still taste you.

			KATHARINE
				(waving at another woman who
pushes a trolley with teapots)
		This is empty, just coming!

			ALMÁSY
		I'm trying to write with your taste
		in my mouth.
				(as she leaves)
		Swoon.  I'll catch you.

Almásy sits watching the party.  The Santa Claus is dragged outside by 
some excited Children.  Almásy picks at his cake removing the thick 
marzipan icing.  He's writing on A CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER, smoothing 
it out - December 22nd.  Betrayals in war are childlike compared with 
out betrayals du...

Katharine, attending to a raucous table, suddenly sags at the knees, 
and SWOONS.  People rush to her.

			KATHARINE
		I'm fine.  How silly.

			OFFICER'S WIFE
				(helping her to her feet)
		It's the heat.

			LADY HAMPTON
		You should sit down, darling.
				(to the others)
		She's quite all right.
				(escorts Katharine away)
		Are you pregnant?

			KATHARINE
		I don't think so.

			LADY HAMPTON
				(squeezing her arm)
		How romantic.  With Fiona I fell
		over every five minutes.  Ronnie
		Christened me Lady Downfall.

			KATHARINE
		I think I might go inside and sit
		down for a few minutes.

			LADY HAMPTON
		I'll come with you.

			KATHARINE
		No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine.

They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.


105	INT.  STORE ROOM.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.  DAY.

A small STOREROOM inside the Palace - Brooms, Mops, Cleaning Equipment.  
Outside, the party is visible as opaque shadows through the beveled 
glass of the ornate window.  The sound of carols sung by the enlisted 
men gives way to a version of SILENT NIGHT played on a solitary 
bagpipe.  Inside, ALMÁSY AND KATHARINE MAKE LOVE IN THE DARKNESS.  
Everything is too fast, desperate, standing up, grabbing, hoisting 
clothes.


106	INT.    CORRIDORS.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    DAY.

A CORRIDOR.  Almásy appears and almost immediately collides with the 
man dressed as SANTA CLAUS.  He moves to one side.  

			CLIFTON
		Have you seen Katharine?

			ALMÁSY
				(taken aback)
		What?

			CLIFTON
		It's Geoffrey under this.

			ALMÁSY
		I haven't, no.  Sorry.


106a*.	INT.    SIDE ROOM IN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    DAY.

Geoffrey continues scouting the warren of tiny rooms that run off the 
central courtyard.  He finds Katharine sitting in one, smoking, 
surrounded by oppressive and elaborate tiling.  Clifton wonders briefly 
how Almásy had missed Katharine.

			CLIFTON
		Darling, I just heard.  You poor
		sausage, are you all right?

			KATHARINE
		I'm fine.  I got hot.

			CLIFTON
		Lady H said she thought you might be -

			KATHARINE
		I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.

			CLIFTON
		Right.

			KATHARINE
		Aren't you?

			CLIFTON
		Sweltering.
				(taking off his hat and beard)
		Come on, I'll take you home.

			KATHARINE
		Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe.
		Aren't you dying for green, anything
		green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel
		rain on your face?  It's Christmas and 
		it's all - I don't know - if you asked me
		I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.

			CLIFTON
		Sweetheart, you know we can't go
		home, there might be a war.

			KATHARINE
				(poking at his costume)
		Geoffrey, you do so love putting
		on a disguise.

			CLIFTON
		I do so love you.
				(he kisses her head)
		What do you smell of?

			KATHARINE
		What?

			CLIFTON
		Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan
		in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.


107*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

The Patient lies alone in his room.  CLIFTON'S FACE stares back at him 
from among the frescoes.  Then something distracts him.

			THE PATIENT
		Are you outside?

A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I can't hide anymore.
				(jerks up his hands)
		I breathe like a dog.  I lose my
		balance.  Stealing's got harder.

Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Why do I feel if I had your book I
		would know everything?

			THE PATIENT
		I don't even know if it is my book.
		The Bedouin found it in the plane,
		in the wreckage.  It's mine now.  
		I heard your breathing and thought
		it might be rain.  I'm dying for rain -
		of course I'm dying anyway - but I
		long to feel rain on my face.

Caravaggio comes close, scrutinizing the face, trying to repair the 
features.  Exasperated.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Is it you?  If I said Moose... I look
		different, fuck, why shouldn't you?

			THE PATIENT
				(impassive)
		Moose.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(a different tack)
		First wedding anniversary - what
		do you call it?

			THE PATIENT
		I don't know.  Paper.  Is it?  Paper?
				(sharp, not wanting to think)
		I don't remember.


108	INT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana stands at the PIANO.  It's still lop-sided, propped against the 
wall.  She tries but can't move it.  So she pulls off the dust-sheet 
and, with the instrument still on a tilt, begins to play the Aria from 
Bach's Goldberg Variations.


109	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA'S PIANO CONTINUES.  Upstairs, Caravaggio chats with the Patient 
while working his arms to RAISE A VEIN, a boot-lace tied around it, 
preparing an injection for himself, tapping the syringe.  During this:

			THE PATIENT
		I have come to love that little tap of
		the fingernail against the syringe.  Tap.


110*.	INT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana plays.  GUN SHOTS punctuates the music.  She's totally engrossed 
and only hears the second or third shot.  Her hands falter, she looks 
up to see A SIKH SOLDIER RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD WAVING HIS ARMS, his 
REVOLVER held aloft.  He approaches the door, his face creased with 
anxiety, and raps on the shattered frame.  It's KIP.

She gets up and walks past Kip standing at the door, and continues the 
seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden VIA THE HOLE 
RIPPED OUT OF THE WALL.

			HANA
		Excuse me.  Yes?
				(of the doors)
		I don't have the key to that door.

			KIP
		The Germans were here.  The Germans 
		were all over this area.  They left mines
		everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite
		hiding places.  

			HANA
		I see.
				(then mischievous)
		Then may be you're safe as long as
		you only play Bach.  He's German.

Kip is looking around the piano.  Hana giggles.

			KIP
		Is something funny?

			HANA
		No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry.
		You came to the doors, that's all and -
				(a little laugh)
		#NAME?
		worried about mines.  That's all.

			KIP
		I've met you before.

			HANA
		I don't think so.

Hana bends to see what Kip's looking at under the piano.  Wires run 
from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an EXPLOSIVE 
CHARGE.   If Hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have 
triggered the charge.  Kip looks at Hana who conceals her dismay with a 
shrug.


110a*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DUSK.

Across from the terrace, HARDY AND KIP ARE PUTTING UP THEIR TENTS.  
Caravaggio stands, chatting amiably to them, holding a haversack, 
smoking a cigarette.


111*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DUSK.

Hana looks down from the Patient's room, watching the tents go up.

			HANA
		He wants us to move out, says there
		could be fifty more mines in the building.
		He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at
		him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.

			THE PATIENT
		Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.

Kip glances up at the window.  Hana, suddenly shy, backs away.

			HANA
		I'll probably marry him.

			THE PATIENT
		Really?  That's sudden.

			HANA
		My mother always told me I would
		summon my husband by playing the piano.

She goes over to the Patient's bed.

			HANA
		I liked it better when there were
		just the two of us.

			THE PATIENT
		Why?  Is he staying?

			HANA
		With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.

			THE PATIENT
		We should charge!  Doesn't anyone
		have a job to do?

			HANA
		They have to clear all the local roads
		of mines.  That's a big job.  They won't
		stay in the house.  They're putting up
		their tent in the garden.

			THE PATIENT
		In that case, I suppose we can't charge.


112*.	INT.    OFFICE, BRITISH HQ.    CAIRO.    DAY.

A SMALL OFFICE, shared by two men, and a mountain of filing cabinets 
and paper.  There are AERIAL MAPS all over the walls.  Clifton is on 
the telephone, while his colleague, RUPERT DOUGLAS, works at the desk.

			CLIFTON
				(into the phone)
		Darling, it's me, I'm sorry,
		something's come up.
				(Katharine responds)
		Don't sulk - I'll be back tomorrow
		evening.  I promise.
				(Katharine responds)
		Okay my precious, I love you.

Rupert makes a face at his friend's sentimentality.  Clifton beams.

			RUPERT
		I didn't know you were going anywhere?

			CLIFTON
		I'm not.  I'm going to surprise her.
		It's our anniversary.  She's forgotten,
		of course.  What's the symbol for your
		first anniversary?  I should get something.
		Is it paper?
				(he knocks sharply on the wall)
		Moose!  Moose, you there?  First
		Anniversary - is it cotton?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Is what cotton?

			CLIFTON
		First Wedding Anniversary.

			RUPERT
				(of Clifton)
		He's hopeless!

			CLIFTON
		Your day will come, my sausage.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Your first anniversary is Paper.


113	EXT.    CAIRO STREET.   O/S  SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.

The approach to the Shepheard's Hotel.  Geoffrey Clifton in a TAXI, 
champagne between his knees.

The car ahead of them SCREECHES TO A HALT as a WOMAN hurries across the 
street.  The driver honks his horn angrily.  The woman puts up a hand 
in apology as she skips across the street to another taxi.  IT'S 
KATHARINE - she's dressed for a date, carries flowers, an overnight 
bag.

Geoffrey, at first excited, is troubled by the accouterments.  Then he 
sees Katharine skip and his whole being punctures.

Katharine's cab roars off.  His own car jerks forward.

			CLIFTON
		Stop!

			CABBIE
		Please?

			CLIFTON
		Stop here.

			CABBIE
		Yessir.

Geoffrey sits in the cab.  Fifty yards short of the hotel.  The world 
rushes by.  He finds a cigarette.


114	INT.    ALMÁSY'S ROOMS.    LATE DAY.

Katharine is in bed.  Almásy has just put A RECORD on.  It's the folk 
song heard at the beginning of the film.  He slips back under the 
covers.  Their clothes are scattered around the room.  He lies over a 
happy Katharine.  She listens.

			KATHARINE
		This is - what is this?

			ALMÁSY
		It's a folk song.

			KATHARINE
		Arabic?

			ALMÁSY
		No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka
		sang it to me.

			KATHARINE
				(as they listen)
		It's beautiful.  What's it about?

			ALMÁSY
				(as if interpreting)
		It's a long song - Szerelem means 
		love...and the story - there's a
		Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer,
		a fool.  For years he's on some kind
		of quest, who knows what?  And then
		one day he falls under the spell of a
		mysterious English woman - a
		harpy - who beats him and hits him
		and he becomes her slave.  He sews
		her clothes, he worships the hem of -

Katharine had thought for a few seconds he was serious, then she 
catches on and starts to beat him.

			ALMÁSY
				(laughing)
		Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!

			KATHARINE
		You bastard, I was believing you!

They embrace, he lies over her, considering her naked back.

			ALMÁSY
		I claim this shoulder blade - oh no,
		wait - I want this!

He turns her over, kisses her throat, then traces the hollow 
indentation.

			ALMÁSY
		This - what's it called? - this place,
		I love it - this is mine!
				(Katharine doesn't know)
		I'm asking the King permission to
		call it the Almasy Bosphorous.

			KATHARINE
				(teasing)
		I thought we were against ownership?
				(kissing him)
		I can stay tonight.

The luxury of this makes them both sad.  The duplicity.  Almásy rolls 
away on to his back.

			ALMÁSY
		Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to
		warn me.  He keeps talking about
		Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea
		of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea
		of a man-to-man chat.

			KATHARINE
		This is a different world - is what
		I tell myself.  A different life.
		And here I am a different wife.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  A different wife.


115	INT. CAB.  CAIRO STREET.  O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.  NIGHT.

The CAB DRIVER is asleep. A loud POP! jerks him awake.  In the back of 
the car Geoffrey has opened the champagne.  He lets it overflow, then 
takes a swig.  He notices the startled driver and puts up an apologetic 
arm.

			CLIFTON
		Sorry.

Two or three CHILDREN knock on the window, begging.  Geoffrey knocks 
back, violently.  They disappear.

			CABBIE
		Hotel now, sir?

			GEOFFREY
		No.

And he throws a silencing wad of money onto the seat by the Cabbie.


116	EXT.    ALMASY'S HOUSE.    OLD CAIRO.    DAWN.

Almásy and Katharine wander out of his building and into the early 
morning streets, hand in hand.


117	EXT.    SPICE MARKET.    CAIRO.    DAWN.

The MORNING PRAYERS rise out from the city's three Minarets.  Almásy 
stops at a stall, which is just preparing to open for the day.  He 
picks up a SILVER THIMBLE, points at it to the merchant who gives him a 
price.  Without comment, Almásy produces the money and, beaming, hands 
the thimble to Katharine.

			ALMÁSY
		I don't care to bargain.
				(she smiles)
		It's full of saffron, just in case
		you think I'm giving it to you to
		encourage your sewing.

			KATHARINE
		That day, had you followed me
		to the market?

			ALMÁSY
		Of course.  You didn't need to slap
		my face to make me feel as if you'd
		slapped my face.

			KATHARINE
				(loving him, but frightened)
		Shall we be all right?

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  Yes.
				(shrugs)
		Absolutely.


118	EXT.    CAIRO STREET.    DAWN.

Katharine takes leave of Almásy on the street corner away from the 
hotel entrance.  They don't kiss, there's no demonstration of feeling.  
He turns immediately away and disappears.


119	INT.  CAB.  CAIRO STREET.  O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.  DAY.

Geoffrey, unshaven, watches as Katharine crosses the street and heads 
towards the hotel.  His expression is terrible, trying to smile, his 
face collapsed.


120	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Cheek to Cheek leaks into the room from a GRAMOPHONE that Caravaggio 
stands over proudly.  The Patient opens his eyes - is confused, 
dislocated - stares blankly at Caravaggio.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(grinning)
		Thought you'd never wake up!

			THE PATIENT
		What?

Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.

			HANA
		Where did you find that?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I liberated it.

			HANA
		I think that's called looting.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(relaxed)
		No-one should own music.  The real
		question is who wrote the song?

			THE PATIENT
		Irving Berlin.

			CARAVAGGIO
		For?

			THE PATIENT
		Top Hat.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Is there a song you don't know?

			HANA
				(speaking for him)
		No.  He sings all the time.

She goes over to the Patient and kisses him gently.

			HANA
		Good morning.
				(of his singing)
		Did you know that?  You're always singing?

			THE PATIENT
		I've been told that before.

			HANA
		Kip's another one.

She goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are pitched, sees 
Hardy shaving, Kip IN THE PROCESS OF WASHING HIS HAIR, his turban 
HANGING LIKE A RIBBON between two trees to dry.  He's perched a bowl on 
the sundial and is dipping his long coal-black hair into it.  As Hana 
watches Kip, Caravaggio changes the record.  The Patient identifies it 
immediately.


121*.	EXT.    MONASTERY GARDEN.     MORNING.

Hana walks past the tent, and passes Hardy.  She's carrying a small 
cup, which she's a little furtive about.  He's carrying a whole armada 
of OIL LIGHTS.  He nods upstairs.

			HANA
		Hello.

			HARDY
		Hello miss.

			HANA
		I was going to say - if you want to
		eat with us, ever... you and Lieutenant
		Singh...

			HARDY
		Very kind of you, we can always eat in
		the town with the others -

			HANA
		Since Caravaggio turned up - food
		seems to appear, so please.

			HARDY
		I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.

			HANA
		You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.
				(Hardy waves that away)
		I thought you were very very tall.  You
		seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt
		like a child who can't keep her balance.

			HARDY
				(does a little mime)
		A toddler

She goes on, and tentatively approaches Kip, who's still working at his 
hair.  Kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm, moving towards her 
like a blink man through the curtain of hair.  He touches her.

			HANA
		Sorry, is it all right I'm seeing this?

Kip shrugs.

			HANA
		My hair was long.  At some point.  
		I've forgotten what a nuisance it is
		to wash.  You know - if you were ever
		around - we get water from the pump
		at noon.

He continues to wash.  She holds up the cup of oil.

			HANA
		Try this.  I found a great jar of it.  
		Olive oil.  In Naples this was so
		precious it would have bought you a wife.

			KIP
		Thank you.

She stands for a second, then walks away.  Kip examines the oil, calls 
after her.

			KIP
		For my hair?

			HANA
				(turning, smiling)
		Yes, for your hair.


122	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA IS GARDENING, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-fledged 
Scarecrow.  Broken bottles, fragments of stained glass and shards from 
a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes too, all jangling and 
tinkling and catching the sunlight.

Kip and Hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles.  She watches 
them, catching Kip's careless wave to her.  She looks briefly at 
herself in A PIECE OF MIRROR dangling from the Scarecrow.


123	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    UPSTAIRS LANDING.    DAY.

Hana walks along the landing with a tray.  There's a message on several 
doors in the corridor from Kip: SAFE, then a couple with the warning: 
DANGER.  She hears noise from the Patient's room.  Listens for a second 
before going in.

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		Because you're reading it too fast!

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		Not at all.

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		You have to read Kipling slowly!
		Your eye is too impatient - think
		about the speed of his pen.
				(quoting Kipling to demonstrate)
		What is it - He sat comma in defiance
		of municipal orders comma astride the
		gun Zamzammah on her brick... What is it?


124	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

During this, Hana comes through with the tray, finds Kip perched on the 
window, relishing his skirmish with the Patient, who has condensed milk 
dribbling down his neck.

			KIP
		Brick platform opposite the old
		Ajaib-Gher -

			THE PATIENT
		#NAME?
		natives called the Lahore Museum.

			KIP
		It's still there, the cannon, outside the
		museum.  It was made of metal cups
		and bowls taken from every household
		in the city as tax, then melted down.
		Then later they fired the cannon at my
		people - comma - The natives.

			THE PATIENT
		So what do you really object to - the
		writer or what he's writing about?

			KIP
		What I really object to, Uncle, is
		your finishing all my condensed milk.
				(snatching up the empty can)
		And the message everywhere in your
		book - however slowly I read it - that
		the best destiny for India is to be ruled
		by the British.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana, we have discovered a shared
		please - the boy and I.

			HANA
		Arguing about books.

			THE PATIENT
		Condensed milk - one of the truly
		great inventions.

			KIP
				(grinning, leaving)
		I'll get another tin.

Hana and the Patient are alone.

			HANA
		I didn't like that book either.  It's
		all about men.  Too many men.
		Just like this house.

			THE PATIENT
		You like him, don't you?  Your
		voice changes.

			HANA
		I don't think it does.
				(a beat)
		Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

			THE PATIENT
		I don't think it's indifference.

Kip comes bounding in with a fresh can.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana was just telling me that you
		were indifferent -

			HANA
				(appalled)
		Hey! - 

			THE PATIENT
		#NAME?

			KIP
		Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not
		Hana's cooking in particular.
				(stabbing at the tin with a bayonet)
		Have either of you ever tried 
		condensed milk sandwiches?


125	DELETED.


126.				INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.   MORNING.

Caravaggio and the Patient are singing - an Arab song which they both 
know from Cairo days.  THUNDER accompanies them.  It's pouring.  
Suddenly the door is flung open and HANA, KIP and HARDY appear.  They 
have the stretcher with them.


127*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    MORNING.

A whoop precedes THE HEADLONG RUSH OF KIP, HARDLY and CARAVAGGIO as 
they cart the Patient across the Cloisters like manic stretcher-
bearers.  Hana is with them, holding an umbrella over the Patient who 
bounces uncomfortably.  He is nervous, a little giddy.  The rain 
buckets down.

			THE PATIENT
				(no irony)
		Careful - careful!


127a*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    MORNING.

The storm tour includes a trip around the pond.  The Patient pushes 
away the umbrella, lets the rain drench him.   He grins at Hana.

			THE PATIENT
		This is wonderful!

			KIP
				(to Hana)
		What's he saying?

			HANA
		He's saying it's wonderful!


128*.	INT.  LIBRARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EGYPTOLOGY.  DAY.

Madox and Almásy are camped in one corner of THE LIBRARY, hunched over 
their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site 
of the next part of the expedition.

			MADOX
				(pushing away his charts)
		And I'm telling you there's nothing
		there to explore.

			ALMÁSY
		No, because you can't see from the air!
		If you could explore from the air life
		would be very simple!
				(he yanks up a map)
		Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi?
		That whole spur is a real possibility...

			MADOX
		Which we've overflown twice.

			ALMÁSY
		Which we couldn't explore because
		of rocks, because of cross-winds,
		it's sloppy.
				(stabbing another location)
		And here - and here - we could be
		staring at Zerzura.

	Other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish.

			MADOX
		So - on Thursday you don't trust
		Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell
		couldn't draw a map, but on Friday
		he's suddenly infallible?

Almásy is surprised by Madox' anger.

			MADOX
		And where are the Expedition Maps?

			ALMÁSY
		In my room.

			MADOX
		Those maps belong to His Majesty's
		Government.  They're confidential.
		They shouldn't be left lying around
		for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have
		sight of.

			ALMÁSY
		What's the matter with you?

			MADOX
		Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know
		there's a war breaking out.
				(he tosses a slip of paper onto
the map, recites its message)
		This arrived this morning.  By order
		of the British Government - all
		International Expeditions to be
		aborted by May 1939.


129	INT.   CAIRO STREET.   DAY.

Almásy and Madox walk down this busy and rather narrow street without 
pavements.  Both of them somber.

			ALMÁSY
		Why do they care about our maps?

			MADOX
		What do we find in the desert?  Arrow
		heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the
		desert, you own North Africa.

			ALMÁSY
				(contemptuous)
		Own the desert.

Almásy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take leave of Madox.

			ALMÁSY
		That place at the base of a woman's
		throat?  You know - the hollow - here -
		does that have an official name?

Madox looks at him.

			MADOX
		For God's sake, man - pull
		yourself together.


130	INT.    OPEN-AIR CINEMA.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

The OPEN-AIR CINEMA is just beginning its evening programme.

PATHE NEWS BEGINS and we date the event to April 1939.  Stories of 
imminent war jostle with images of Merrie England.  Village greens, 
sporting victories, Cruft's Dog Show.  Alone among the necking couples 
- mostly soldiers with their Egyptian girlfriends - in an otherwise 
empty block, is Katharine.  She's waiting for Almásy.  A SOLDIER comes 
over to Katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her.

			SOLDIER
		Beggin your pardon, miss, but have
		you got a lighter?

Katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen.  An item 
about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and TOP HAT.  The stars do their 
stuff.  The soldier moves a seat nearer.

			SOLDIER
				(leering)
		I love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?

			KATHARINE
		Fuck off.

			SOLDIER
		What?

			KATHARINE
		You heard me.

The Soldier slinks off, muttering.  Katharine is wretched.  She sits 
head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about 
duplicity, sordid assignations.

Almásy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily 
large across the screen.

			ALMÁSY
		Sorry.

They watch the screen.  Katharine is weeping.  Almásy doesn't 
understand.  He puts his arm around her.

			KATHARINE
		I can't do this, I can't do this any more.


131*.	EXT.    GROPPI PARK.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

A man walks round with A HAND BELL - announcing that the Park is 
closing.  He turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages.  
Almásy and Katharine sit stiffly on a bench.  They don't speak.  Almásy 
puts his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders.  The lights are 
gradually being extinguished around them.

	Finally, Katharine gets up.

			KATHARINE
		I'd better get back.
				(she keeps him away with a hand)
		Say goodbye here.

			ALMÁSY
		I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm
		agreeing, because I'm not.

They stand, awkward.  Katharine rehearses her position.  The bell 
clangs.

			KATHARINE
		I just know - any minute he'll find out,
		we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it
		will ill him.

			ALMÁSY
		Don't go over it again, please.

He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them, then releases them, gets 
up, walks away.  She walks towards the gate.  He calls after her.

			ALMÁSY
		Katharine -

	He walks towards her, his smile awful.

			ALMÁSY
		I just wanted you to know.
		I'm not missing you yet.

She nods, can't find this funny.

			KATHARINE
		You will.  You will.

Then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the 
gatepost, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries away.


132*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Hana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against the 
morning light.  His breathing is noticeably worsening, a shudder of a 
breath, the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible.  Hana 
frets, touches his wrist, feeling for the pulse.

			THE PATIENT
		I'm still here.

			HANA
		You'd better be.

			THE PATIENT
		Don't depend on it.  Will you?
		That little bit of air, each day
		there's less of it, which is al right,
		which is quite all right.

She squeezes his hand, suddenly overwhelmed.

			THE PATIENT
				(brightly)
		I've been talking to Caravaggio - my
		research assistant - there's meant to be
		a ghost in the Cloisters.  I can join him!

There's some kind of noise from the garden.  Muffled shouts.

			THE PATIENT
		It's the boy.

Hana goes to the window, opens the shutters.  The day pours in.


132A*.	EXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.

Hana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at the far perimeter of the 
garden in the olive groves, HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIM, HIS LEG HELD 
OUT STRANGELY.  WIRES run from his foot in all directions as if he'd 
trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb.


133	EXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.

Hana appears at the edge of the Olive groves and hurries towards Kip, 
who hasn't moved.  He shouts warning her.

			KIP
		Go to the left!  Keep to the left!  There
		are mines and trip wires everywhere!

Hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long 
grass.  He shouts, doesn't want her close.

			KIP
		Get Hardy.  He's on the other side of 
		town.  In the hills.  Get him to hurry.

She keeps coming, can see that he needs her.

			HANA
		It's okay - I'll help.  Please.

			KIP
		The mines, the wires, there's a trick.
		Some explode if you stretch the wires,
		some if you cut them.

			HANA
		What do I do?

			KIP
		There's a mine here, but the others are
		far enough away, I think at least to
		give me a chance.  I have to work out
		which one to cut before I fall over.

			HANA
		So I follow the wires?

			KIP
		You get Hardy.

			HANA
		I follow the wires.

She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.

			KIP
		Don't touch them.

She follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back 
to Kip's foot.  Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine 
some thirty metres away.

			HANA
		Why would anyone do this?

			KIP
		I've done this.  I've had to do this.

	Then Hana's suddenly tense.

			HANA
		Give me a second.

She turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER AREA, straight to what 
had seized her attention.  Kip is appalled.

			KIP
		What are you doing?!  Hana!

Heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as THE 
TORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, ANOTHER 
CONCRETE-COVERED MINE.

Hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal.  She turns, 
holding the protesting animal in triumph.  HER FOOT SNAGS ON A WIRE.  
She has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise.   
She goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal.  Then 
she's back with Kip.  He's seething.  She is strangely elated.

			KIP
		What is this business with you and
		explosives?  Do you think you're immune?

			HANA
		I promise you that was the right thing
		to do.  He's my good luck.
				(she gets the pliers from his belt,
and hands them to him)
		Now cut.  This one.
				(she indicates the wire)
		I hope we don't die.

			KIP
		Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.

			HANA
		I'm not scared.  So many people have
		died around me.  But I would be a
		shame for us.
				(shrugs)
		I don't feel like being shy.

			KIP
		You must get away.  Before I cut.  I'm
		not cutting if you're here.

He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.

			HANA
		Actually, you can't cut, can you?
		You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.

			KIP
		No.

But he hands them over.

			HANA
		Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.


			KIP
		Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and
		then cut.

Hana checks, lies down.  He bends as close to the ground as he dares 
AND KISSES HER, THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS.


134	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    CONTINUOUS.

The Patient lies in bed.  He's agitated by the silence.  SUDDENLY 
THERE'S AN EXPLOSION.  He tries to shout, a croak which quickly reduces 
him to coughing and breathlessness.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana!  Hana!  Kip!  Hana!

He tries to move.  He can't.  He's frantic.

FOOTSTEPS, as someone hurtles up the stairs.  It's Hana.  She's ashamed 
to have forgotten him.  She rushes to him.

			HANA
		I'm sorry.  I forgot you'd be worrying.
		We're all safe.  It was a mine, but not
		the mine.  Nobody's hurt.  I'm sorry.

She calms him.  He's exhausted.  His eyes shine.


135	EXT.    MOUNTAIN ROAD.    ITALY.    LATE DAY.

Hana clings onto Kip as the TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE hares along the circling 
road.  She has her arms around his waist.  His head turns to her for a 
second and she smiles.

136	EXT.    ROAD BLOCK.    TUSCANY.    DUSK.

Kip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD BLOCK.  Kip is being 
questioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and 
accompanied by several meaningful glances at Hana, who waits, standing 
by the motorcycle.  One of the SOLDIERS saunters over and returns her 
papers.

			SOLDIER
		And you're definitely traveling with
		him of your own free will?

			HANA
		Yes.

			SOLDIER
				(clearly disapproving)
		Just wanting to be sure.  And he's
		taking you to church?

			HANA
				(deadpan)
		Yes.  We're going to a funeral.  A cow has
		died.  And in his religion they're sacred.

The Soldier isn't sure what to make of this.  He signals to his 
companion who returns Kip's papers.  Kip walks back to the motorcycles.  
He says nothing.  He kicks the starter.  Hana gets on, slides her arms 
lovingly around him.


137	EXT.    BRIDGE.    ITALY.    DUSK.

IT'S GETTING DARK.  The bike, headlights on, crosses a bridge.  Kip has 
strapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding 
crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down Italy.


138	EXT.    AREZZO.   DUSK.

	Kip steers the motorbike into the deserted PIAZZA.

They dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload 
the panniers.  Hana still doesn't know what's in store and looks 
questioningly at Kip as he walks up to the door of the CHURCH.


139	INT.    CHURCH.    DUSK.

They enter the Church.  It's in almost total darkness.  THEN A FLARE 
SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR.  It's magnificent.  Kip holds the 
flare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other.  Hana walks 
behind him, still perplexed.  There is PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING 
EVERYWHERE, AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND THE ALTARS, AND THE 
STATUES.

A SECOND FLARE.  Kip has appeared through A SECRET DOOR high in the 
church, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are 
momentarily visible.  He flings a rope over the rafters.

Now Kip circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and 
shoulder.  He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before 
disappearing.

Hana stands holding the flare.  She can't see Kip, can only hear him 
scrambling.

			HANA
		Kip?

He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters.  He collects the 
other end of the rope which is attached to Hana.  Holding onto it, he 
just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.

SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing 
around the Church.  Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through 
space, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted 
by Piero Della Francesca.  Hana's flare makes a halo around her head.

Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and 
causes Hana to SWING to the right.  She lets out a giddy laugh, 
exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - 
faces, bodies, angels.  Kip guides the rope as if they were making 
love, which in a way they are.

Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO 
SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed.  She reaches out to touch the giant neck of 
the sad Queen.

Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope.  Hana's 
face is full of tears.  He smiles, holds her.


140	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio is with the Patient.  He sits in the window.  Fiddles with 
the bandages of his hands.

			THE PATIENT
		There was a general who wore a patch
		over a perfectly good eye.  The men 
		fought harder for him.  Sometimes I
		think I could get up and dance. 
		What's under your bandages?

Caravaggio goes to him, holding out his hands, the bandage ends 
trailing.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hold the ends.

The Patient holds them.  Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages 
unraveling and unraveling.  


141*.	INT.  TOBRUK.  BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.  JUNE 1942.  DAY.

Caravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit, walks 
through the mangled corridors of British HQ.  Smoke is rising from 
buildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers in the distance as 
the harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions.  TOBRUK IS UNDER 
SIEGE.  BHQ is a place in the throws of dismantling itself.  
SECRETARIES are visiting braziers manned by ARAB BOYS who stoke the 
fires as boxes of papers are fed into them.  ASHES hover in the air.


142*.	INT.   BHQ.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

Caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks.  From one of 
them, a young woman, AICHA, kisses him, frowning at the chaos and the 
shelling.

			AICHA
		He's waiting for you.

Some doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently 
SHREDDING DOCUMENTS.  Caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar 
and where the incumbent, FENELON-BARNES, is stripping the room of his 
personal possessions-  photographs, stone branches, a cricket bat.


142a*.	INT.   FENELON-BARNES OFFICE.   BHQ.   TOBRUK.   DAY.

Caravaggio enters.

			FENELON-BARNES
				(barely looking up)
		What a bloody flap, eh?  I heard from
		Alexandria this morning - apparently
		no-one there is accepting British pounds.
		And if you pick up a telephone 
		everybody's practicing their German.
				(holds up some gramophone records)
		What do you do - do you take these
		things?
				(then, awkward)
		Look, Moose, we need you to stay in
		Tobruk.  A bit of a short straw but
		the thinking is we'll be back - I mean,
		we will be back - but...and in the
		interim we need eyes and ears on
		the ground.

A BIG BOMB lands nearby.  The building shudders and plaster dust drops 
from the ceiling.  Almost oblivious, the two men head out of the 
office.  Fenelon-Barnes lugs the TRUNK last glimpsed in his tent by 
Almásy, until Caravaggio takes over.


143*.	INT. CORRIDOR OF BRITISH HEADQUARTERS. TOBRUK. DAY.

Fenelon-Barnes and Caravaggio make their way down the stairs and to the 
entrance.

			CARAVAGGIO
		We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk.
		What are they going to be doing?

			FENELON-BARNES
				(continuing to pack)
		Giving Rommel a bloody nose. That's
		my suggestion.  But did you hear
		the BBC last nigh?  Tobruk is of no
		strategic importance - makes you wonder.

AICHA is at the bottom of the stairs.  She falls into step.

			FENELON-BARNES
		Jerry's got our maps you know.  Swines.
		Before the war we helped them run about
		the desert making maps - and now they
		get spies into Cairo using our maps, they'll
		get Rommel into Cairo using our maps.
		The whole of the desert like a bus route
		and we gave it to them.   Any foreigner who
		turned up - welcome to the Royal Geographic,
		take our maps.  Madox went mad, you know -
		you knew Peter Madox? - after he found
		out he'd been betrayed by his friend.
		Absolutely destroyed the poor sod.  Shot
		himself in a church in Dorset.

Caravaggio opens the door, Fenelon-Barnes goes through.


144*.	EXT.    BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

The Fenelon-Barnes trunk is taken from Caravaggio and joins the pile of 
luggage and artifacts, which wait to be shipped out.

			FENELON-BARNES
		I'd like to get that bastard Almásy -
		settle the score, eh?  That's my
		fantasy - said he, clearing out.
		Must have been a spy all along.


145	DELETED.


146*.	EXT.    TOBRUK DOCKSIDE.    DAY.

A GERMAN TROOP CARRIER rumbles forward passing a line of BEDRAGGLED 
BRITISH POWS as they're marched along the side of harbor.


146a*. EXT.    TOBRUK RUINED QUARTER.    DAY.

A HILL OF SALVAGED ARMY BOOTS is being explored by a couple of GERMAN 
SOLDIERS in search of better footwear.  Below them the POWS trudge by, 
one of them barefoot.  ONE OF THE GERMANS tosses down a pair of boots 
then continues his own perusal.


146b*. EXT.    TOBRUK SQUARE.    DAY.

A crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the MOSTLY ARAB 
FACES.  Their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting 
at open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO.  AN 
ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her 
ominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD.  An INTERPRETER mediates.  The 
OFFICER doesn't believe the woman.  She's getting frantic at the 
possibility of losing her child.

Suddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by 
her hair.  She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to 
recognize her as the pretty AICHA.  She touches a couple of people in 
the line.  They're horrified.  Soldiers pull them away.  Caravaggio 
doesn't look, stares straight ahead.  An officer watches him AS HE 
TURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER.  THEIR EYES CATCH 
FOR AN INSTANT AND THE OFFICER SEES IT.

CARAVAGGIO RUNS, bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one 
corner of the square.  The CONGREGATION throws itself to the ground 
until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man.


146c*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   INTERIOR OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

Shots pursue Caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble, then bobs 
up again as he darts inside a blasted building.  He clambers up some 
ruined stairs, heaves over the wall.


146d*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   FACADE OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

CARAVAGGIO grabs a metal bar on the facade of the building, from which 
he hangs, looking for the next foothold.  Soldiers appear along the top 
of the building, shouting, rifles ready.  AN OFFICER arrives and stops 
the soldiers firing, and the others begin to laugh as Caravaggio hangs 
from the bar fifteen feet above a balcony, slowly losing his strength.  
Another SOLDIER waits for him in the balcony below.  Now he starts to 
laugh.  Caravaggio hangs.


147*.	INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. TOBRUK. NOVEMBER 13,1942. DAY.

Caravaggio is slumped at a table, HIS HANDS MANACLED TO ITS THICK 
WOODEN LEGS.  There's A TELEPHONE at another table in the corner of the 
room attended by a CLERK with A STENOGRAPHER working next to him.  The 
room has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows.  SOLDIERS stand 
guard at the door.  It's a horrible room.  Caravaggio is trying to 
sleep, he's unshaven, and pasty-looking.  His interrogator, Müller, 
seems incredibly tired and aggravated.  He's on the phone.

			MÜLLER
				(in German)
		Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

He slams down the phone and comes back to the table.

			MÜLLER
		David Caravaggio.

			CARAVAGGIO
		No.

			MÜLLER
		Petty thief, six months imprisonment
		Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(barely with humor)
		I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong
		man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio
		Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both
		painters, I think that is confusing you.

Müller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file.  Pulls 
out some photographs, starts spreading them out.

			MÜLLER
		Is this you?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I don't know.

			MÜLLER
		It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at
		British Headquarters - July 41.  And so was
		this - August 41.  And this -February 42.

			CARAVAGGIO
		It's impossible.  I was buying or selling
		something.  I've been to Cairo many times.

			MÜLLER
		You are a Canadian spy working for
		the Allies.  Code-name Moose.

THE PHONE rings again, is answered.  The Clerk calls to Müller who gets 
up, irritably.  Caravaggio addresses the room.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Could I have a doctor?  I am passing
		blood.  I must be bleeding internally.
				(to the clerk)
		Can you get a doctor?  Look -
				(he spits onto the table,
there's blood in his mouth)
		I'm leaking blood.
				(he indicates a Guard)
		He kicks me.  He kicks me all the time.

Nobody responds.  Müller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, 
negotiating time.  The call finishes.

			CLERK
				(in German)
		He's asking for a doctor.

			MÜLLER
				(to Caravaggio)
		You want a doctor?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a 
		month, I don't know, also my leg was -

			MÜLLER
		We don't have a doctor, but we
		do have a nurse.

			CARAVAGGIO
		A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great.
		A nurse?  Great.

Müller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up.  Just then the 
telephone rings again.  He hesitates.

			MÜLLER
				(in German)
		Leave it and get the nurse!

The Clerk exits.  The phone rings.  The Stenographer is plagued by 
flies.  Suddenly he slaps at one.

			MÜLLER
				(snapping)
		Why is there so much nose?  I can't
		hear myself think!
				(turns to Caravaggio)
		Look - give me something.  So we can
		all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.
				(wiping his face)
		It's too hot.

			CARAVAGGIO
		I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife
		in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points
		at you, you only see trouble.

The NURSE comes in.  She is Arab and her head is covered.

			MÜLLER
		I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  This
		is your nurse, by the way.  She's Moslem,
		so she'll understand all of this.  What's
		the punishment for adultery?  Let's
		leave it at that.  You're married and 
		you were fucking another woman, so
		that's - is it the hands that are cut off?
		Or is that for stealing?  Does anyone know?

There's silence.  Müller turns to Caravaggio.

			MÜLLER
		Well, you must know.  You were 
		brought up Libya, yes?

			CARAVAGGIO
		Don't cut me.

			MÜLLER
		Or was it Toronto?

			CARAVAGGIO
				(ashen)
		Don't cut me.  Come on.

Now the phone starts again.  The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse 
exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to 
interrupt Müller.

			MÜLLER
		Ten fingers.  How about this?  You
		give me a name for every finger -
		doesn't matter who.  I get something,
		you keep something.  I'm trying to be
		reasonable.  Fenelon-Barnes, we could 
		call that two names.
				(pauses, suddenly puzzled)
		Are thumbs fingers?
				(in GERMAN to the others)
		Is a thumb a finger?

No response.  Müller opens his palms to Caravaggio.

			MÜLLER
		I get no help from these people.

			CLERK
				(in German)
		The telephone -

Müller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down.  an AIR RAID 
SIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is 
also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack-
clack of the STENOGRAPHER.  At that moment, Müller suddenly becomes 
aware of what is happening.  He turns on the Stenographer.

			MÜLLER
				(in German)
		What are you doing?

			STENOGRAPHER
				(awkward, in German)
		That Geneva Convention.  I'm -

	Müller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.

			CARAVAGGIO
		You can't do that!  Hey - come on!

DURING THIS Müller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and 
produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR.  He hands it to the nurse, makes a line 
across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio.  The 
nurse is extremely reluctant.  Müller claps his hands, pushes her 
towards Caravaggio.

			MÜLLER
		Go!  Hey!  Go!

Caravaggio is in terror.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.

The guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's 
shoulders to prevent him from moving.  The nurse, grim-faced, 
approaches, kneels at the table. 

			CARAVAGGIO
				(as she prepares to cut)
		Listen, I'll give you a name.  What
		name did you say?  I knew them!
		I promise.  Please - please!

And then he SCREAMS AND SCREAMS and jerks up, carrying the guards and 
the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off 
balance.  He falls to the floor, ROARING WITH PAIN, blood everywhere, 
the table on top of him.  The AIR RAID is continuing outside, the PHONE 
IS RINGING, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.

			MÜLLER
		Cut the other thumb.

He stabs at his own right thumb.

			MÜLLER
		This one!  Come on!

The nurse, horrified, shakes her head.  Müller snatches the razor from 
her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio.

One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in 
half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Müller approaches.  
Caravaggio can't move.  He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles 
him.  His eyes are streaming with tears.

Now Müller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts 
Caravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his 
mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of 
the table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his 
knees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.


148	INT.    INTERROGATION ROOM.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

LATER, and Caravaggio comes round.  His eyes open and then his face 
spasms with pain.  He looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes 
he's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the 
table on its side.  He gets up and staggers out of the open door and up 
the stairs.


149*.	INT.  STAIRS FROM INTERROGATION ROOM.  TOBRUK.   DAY.
 
The corridor is deserted, but the body of a GERMAN SOLDIER sprawls on 
the stairs leading up to daylight.  Outside Caravaggio can hear 
fighting.


150*.	EXT.    ROOF.    INTERROGATION BUILDING.    DAY.

Caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building.  Grey and 
yellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire 
accompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people 
shouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening.

SUDDENLY A PARACHUTE FLOATS DOWN BY HIM.  THEN ANOTHER.  THEN ANOTHER.  
HE'S SURROUNDED BY PARACHUTES.  THE BRITISH ARE RECLAIMING TOBRUK.  A 
PARATROOPER LANDS ON THE ROOF, AND GESTURES TO CARAVAGGIO TO RAISE HIS 
HANDS.  HE SLOWLY DOES SO.


151*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Caravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his NAKED HANDS to 
the Patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his 
thumbs were.  The Patient reaches out to take his hands and gently 
lowers them.  Caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back 
round his fists.

			CARAVAGGIO
		The man who took my thumbs, I found
		him eventually - he's dead.  The man who
		took my photograph, I found him too -
		that took me a year.  He's dead.  Another
		man took that man across the desert to
		Cairo.  Now I intend to find him.

The LIGHTS FROM THE MOTORBIKE approaching the Monastery, its growl.  
Caravaggio goes to the window and watches as Kip and Hana arrive.


152	INT.   AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.   CAIRO, 1939.   NIGHT.

Last seen at the Troops Christmas party, the INNER COURTYARD has been 
transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. The 
Almásy/Madox team is assembled for A FAREWELL DINNER.  They are waiting 
for Almásy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty.  He is very late.  
And then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing.  He practically 
dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position 
opposite Katharine.  He bows to Lady Hampton.

			ALMÁSY
		I believe I'm rather late.

			MADOX
				(ignoring the drama of this entrance)
		Good, we're all here?  A toast,
		to the International Sand club -
		may it soon resurface.

			THE OTHERS
		The International Sand Club!

			ALMÁSY
				(raising his glass)
		Misfits, buggers, fascists, and
		paedophiles.  God bless us every one.

The others drink, trying to ignore his mood.

			ALMÁSY
		Oops!  Mustn't say International.  
		Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty!
		Die Führer!  Il Duce.

			CLIFTON
		Sorry, what's your point?

			ALMÁSY
				(ignoring the remark)
		And the people here don't want us.
		Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are
		desperate to get rid of the Colonials...
				(to an embarrassed Fouad)
		- isn't that right?  Their best people
		get down on hands and knees 
		begging to be spared a knighthood.
				(to his host, Sir Hampton)
		Isn't that right?

Ronnie Hampton shrugs.  They're all very uncomfortable.  Almásy glares 
at Clifton.

			ALMÁSY
		What's my point?
				(standing up)
		Oh!  I've invented a new dance - the
		Bosphorus Hug.  Anybody up to it?
		Madox?  D'Ag?  Come on D'Aggers.

			D'AGOSTINO
		Let's eat first.  Sit down.

The Band is now playing Manhattan - Almásy, without missing a beat, 
begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows.  He 
lurches around.  Katharine can't look at him.

			ALMÁSY
		...We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish
		we'll frighten when we're in.  your
		bathing suit so thin will make the
		shellfish grin, fin to fin. --  Those
		were the words - actually - before
		they were cleaned up.  Could be a
		song for you, Mrs. Clifton -
				(a perfect English accent)
		#NAME?

Madox gets up and pulls Almásy into his chair, taking charge.

			MADOX
		Look, either shut up, or go home.

			ALMÁSY 
				(darkly)
		Absolutely right, shut up.  Lashings of
		apologies all round.


153*.	EXT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.

Later, now MOST OF THE GROUP ARE DANCING.  We see Katharine dancing 
with Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself.  Bermann is there and even Madox 
jogging and grinning foolishly.  Clifton looks at Katharine who, as the 
dance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom.  Almásy hovers in 
the shadows, unseen.


154*.	INT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.

Katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is 
suddenly confronted by Almásy, tortured and out of control.

			ALMÁSY
		Why did you hold his collar?

			KATHARINE
		What?

			ALMÁSY
				(mimicking her inflection)
		What?  What?  That boy, that little boy,
		you were holding his collar, gripping
		his collar, what for?

			KATHARINE
		Would you let me pass?

			ALMÁSY
		Is he next?  Do you drag him into your
		little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?

			KATHARINE
		Don't do this.

			ALMÁSY
		I've watched you - on verandahs, at
		Garden Parties, at the Races - how
		can you stand there?  How can you
		ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?

			KATHARINE
		You know why?

He tries to hold her.  She resists

			ALMÁSY
		Dance with me.

			KATHARINE
		No.

			ALMÁSY
		Dance with me.  I want to touch you.
		I want the things which are mine.
		Which belong to me.

			KATHARINE
		Do you think you're the only one who
		feels anything?  Is that what you think?

Some women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the 
Ladies Room.  They collect Katharine in their train and leave Almásy to 
fall back into the shadows.


155	INT.    THE PATIENTS' ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana sits with the Patient.  His eyes are full of tears.  He opens 
them, sees her, watching over him.  He's embarrassed.

			THE PATIENT
		Why don't you go?
				(wiping his eyes)
		You should sleep.

			HANA
		Would you like me to?

He nods.  She gets up, touches his hand, then leaves.


156*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY, LANDING AND STAIRS.    NIGHT.

Hana leaves the room, then turns and sees A TINY LAMP on the floor, 
it's made from a SNAIL SHELL and oil.  She bends to it curiously, then 
sees a second lamp half-way down the stairs, then a third further down.  
She smiles in the light, then follows the trail.


157	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.


In the Cloisters THE TRAIL OF SHELL LAMPS CONTINUES, like tiny cat's 
eyes.  As they reach the hopscotch chalk marks, they outline the 
squares.  Hana HOPSCOTCHES and then follows the light, disappearing 
round a corner.



158	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    NIGHT.

Hana comes through into the stables.  The lamps lead her, then they 
stop.  She peers into the shadows.

			KIP (O/S)
		Hana.

She turns to the voice.  He steps out of the darkness.

			HANA 
				(happy )
		Kip.

And he goes to her.


159	EXT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    EARLY MORNING.

Hardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables.  Eventually Hana 
opens the door.

			HARDY
		I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.

			HANA
		He's sleeping.

			HARDY
		Only we have to go to work.

			HANA
		I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?

			HARDY
		A bomb.  At the Viaduct.

She closes the door, then reappears.

			HANA
		Does he have to go?

			HARDY
		Pardon me?

			HANA
		What if you couldn't find him...?
				(Hardy's bewildered)
		Sergeant, not today, please.
		Not this morning.

Kip comes to the door, winding his turban.

			KIP
		What's happening?  Am I needed?

			HARDY
		I'm afraid so, sir.

Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.

			HANA
		Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love
		a coward, I can't love another dead man.

			KIP
		This is what I do.  I do this every day.

And he's ready, Hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles.  He gets on 
his, and they're away, Hana hardly able to look.


160	EXT.    A VIADUCT NORTH OF THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

KIP IS LOWERED BY A PULLEY INTO THE SHAFT THE SAPPERS HAVE MADE AROUND 
THE BOMB.  Hardy supervises.  The bombs huge - 2, 000 lbs, and 
protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a pool of 
sludge at the base of the viaduct.

Kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust.   
Warily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of the 
case.  He wipes the metal.  Reveals a serial number, calls it out to 
Hardy, who's perched on the bank.

			KIP
		Serial number - KK-1P2600.

He's hypnotized by the number: KK-1P: a bomb with his name on it.


161	EXT.    ROAD APPROACHING VIADUCT.   DAY.

Hana cycles along on Caravaggio's bicycle.  A TANK comes roaring up 
behind her, then a second and a third, loaded up with people, citizens 
and soldiers, and children, waving flags and gesticulating.  She lets 
the metal circus go by.


162	INT.    BOMB SHAFT.    DAY.

Back in the shaft, Kip works away, his fingers shaking with the cold 
from the oxygen he's using to freeze the fuse.  Suddenly there's a 
VIOLENT TREMOR.  The ground is SHUDDERING, and the bomb slips horribly.  
Kip GRABS AT IT helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling, 
instead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge.

			KIP
		Hardy!  Hardy!  What's happening?!


163	EXT.    VIADUCT.    DAY.

The TANKS are rumbling towards the Viaduct.  HORNS start sounding.  
HARDY, below, bellows at his men above for explanation.

			HARDY
		Corporal!?  Dade!!

			DADE
		Tanks, sir.  Don't know what it's about.
		God only knows.

			HARDY
				(incredulous)
		What is this - a bloody carnival?
		Stop them!

Three Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession.  
They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back wit their flags - 
Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks.  Now SHOTS are ringing out.  In the 
shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen 
spurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of 
the water.  Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety.

			HARDY
		You've got to cut, sir, that frost
		won't last.

			KIP
		Go away.

			HARDY
		Yessir.

			KIP
		This is making me incredibly angry.

He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips 
them through the tiny gap.  His hand touches the casing and the freeze 
BURNS his hand.  He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge, 
cursing.

Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to 
find the pliers.  Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help.  The seconds 
run out as Kip grovels in the mud.  Totally submerged, he suddenly 
comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and 
cuts.  There's a snip.  Then nothing.  Then Kip laughs at Hardy.

			KIP
		Kiss me.

Hardy is already at the winch, hauling it up.  Kip can hardly clip on 
the halter - his hands numb and burned.  As the pulley jerks he just 
clings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out 
of a bog.

The other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site.  Great 
elation on their faces.

			HARDY 
		Get a blanket!
				(not getting attention)
		Dade!  Get the Lieutenant a blanket.

			DADE
		It's over, Sarge.  It's over.  Jerry's surrendered.
				(to Kip)
		Sir, congratulations!

Kip shakes his hand.  Kip shakes Hardy's hand.

			KIP
		Congratulations.  

And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS 
FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory  celebrations begin.  Kip's 
blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around 
his shoulders.

HANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his 
blanket, the men celebrating.  She shouts with relief from the top of 
the bridge.

			HANA
		Kip!


164	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

	A VICTORY CELEBRATION PARTY.

The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra.  Kip sits in the window, the 
shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the 
music, sucking out of his condensed milk.  Elsewhere there is an open 
bottle of cognac, some wine.  The Patient has a beaker of wine.  
Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.

			HANA
		Kip - come and dance with me

			KIP
				(a sly wobble of the head)
		Yes.  Later.

Caravaggio swirls past the Patient - nodding at the cognac.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Have a drink.

			THE PATIENT
		I've had a drink.  Fatal.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Well, anything you do is likely 
		to be fatal, so you know -

			THE PATIENT
		Very true!


165	EXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    NIGHT.

A tiny PIAZZA where the Sappers and the Villagers are having their own, 
more raucous, Victory Feste.  There are accordions, there's dancing, 
and there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: 
DORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE FOUNTAIN.  He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to 
the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK 
FLAG he has in his mouth.

BLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant.  He's drunk and 
slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with 
a great splash, to much hilarity.  


166	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing.  The music has stopped.  
Caravaggio changes the record.  Hana goes to Kip for a second, beaming, 
before Caravaggio has snatched her away again.  The Patient taps along 
to the music.

			THE PATIENT
		Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?

			HANA
		Never heard of it.

			THE PATIENT
		That was a dance we invented at
		the International Sand Club.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(cryptic)
		What?  You and Madox?  Or you
		and Katharine Clifton?

			THE PATIENT
				(a small laugh)
		What?

There's a muddled thud in the distance, Kip's ears prick up.  He 
glances for an instant out of the window.

			HANA
				(anxious, of the noise)
		What was that?

She is spinning with Caravaggio.  When she comes round again, Kip has 
gone.


167	EXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    ITALY 1945.    NIGHT.

	Kip's motorbike skids into the tiny PIAZZA.

A MILITARY AMBULANCE IS ALREADY THERE.  Dade and SPALDING are presiding 
as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck.  The 
shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give 
some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the 
shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm.  ONE GIRL, young and quite 
striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the 
doors of the ambulance.

SPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know 
what happened.

			SPALDING
		Booby trap.  They was running up the
		Union Jack, sir, up off that statue -
		It just went off.

			DADE
		Should have been me.  It was my idea
		but Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir,
		him and Blackler.

Kip goes to the ambulance.  Spalding tries to stop him.

			SPALDING
		Sir - you don't want to look.

Kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both bodies, does 
look, then comes out, past the weeping girl.

			KIP
		Who's that girl?

			DADE
		His fiancee, sir.

			KIP
				(astonished)
		Hardy's?

			DADE
		Kept it a bit dark.


168	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    APPROACHING DAWN.

Kip has pulled out all of Hardy's gear.  Now he starts on the tent.  
Hana comes out into the step.  Kip turns, his eyes brimming, sees her, 
sighs, then turns back and kicks at the pegs, collapsing the tent.

Now he's trying to fold a shirt.  Hana takes it from him.  She folds 
it.  Then together they start to fold the tent, Kip orchestrating, not 
wanting to talk.  Finally, Kip looks at Hana, stiff with emotion.

			KIP
		I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! -
		the Patient, Hardy: they're
		everything that's good about England.
		I couldn't even say what that was.
		We didn't exchange two personal words,
		and we've been together through some
		terrible things, some -
				(incredulous)
		he was engaged to a girl in the village! -
		I mean -
				(looks at Hana)
		and us - he never once... He didn't
		ask me if I could spin the ball at
		cricket or the kamasutra or -
		I don't even know what I'm 
		talking about.

			HANA
		You loved him.


169*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio, reading Dante aloud in Italian, smoking, walks over to the 
window, looks out.


169*.	EXT.    KIP'S TENT.    EVENING.

Hana is approaching Kip's tent, carrying a light.  She ducks inside the 
tent and the light disappears.


169b*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio turns back into the room, towards the Patient, still 
reading.


170	INT.    KIP'S TENT.    NIGHT.

Hana lies over Kip, unraveling his turban, slowly, sensual.

			HANA
		If one night I didn't come to the tent,
		what would you do?
			KIP
		I try not to expect you.

			HANA
		But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?

			KIP
		Then I'd think there must be a reason.

			HANA
		You wouldn't come to find me?
				(Kip shrugs)
		That makes me never want to come here.

But she continues unraveling the turban.

			HANA
		Then I tell myself he spends all
		day searching, in the night he
		wants to be found.


171*.	EXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  1939.  DAY.

The Expedition Team is packing up the Basecamp.  Madox and Almásy are 
loading things into the plane.  FOUAD, AL AUF and others work at the 
cars.

			MADOX
		Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria
		is still out, which I'm looking forward
		to.  She says Dorset is gripped with
		Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I
		should have thought, still...

			ALMÁSY
		Right.

			MADOX
		Bermann thinks he'll be interned,
		poor fellow.  I'm going to do what
		I can, but...  And D'Ag turns out 
		to be a great admirer of Mussolini.
		So now you can say I told you so.

			ALMÁSY
		I told you so.

			MADOX
		We didn't care about countries.
		Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians,
		Germans.  None of that mattered,
		did it?  It was something finer than that.

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass.
		I'll look after it for you.

			MADOX
				(shrugging this off)
		When's Clifton picking you up?

			ALMÁSY
		Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry.
		I'll be ready.

			MADOX
		I'll leave the plane in the hangar at
		Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it...hard to
		know how long one's talking about.  We
		might all be back in a month or two.

Madox kneels and takes A HANDFUL OF SAND, puts it into his pocket.  He 
throws his haversack into the plane then turns.  Almásy puts out a 
hand.  This is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, 
conducted as if nothing were happening.

			MADOX
		I have to teach myself not to read
		too much into everything.  Comes of
		too long having to read so much into
		hardly anything at all.

			ALMÁSY
		Goodbye, my friend.

They shake hands.

			MADOX
		May God make safety your companion.

			ALMÁSY
				(a tradition)
		There is no God.
				(smiles)
		But I hope someone looks after you.

Madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his 
throat.

			MADOX
		In case you're still wondering - this
		is called the supasternal notch.

Almásy nods, goes to the propeller.

			MADOX
		Come and visit us in Dorset.  When
		all this nonsense is over.
				(then shrugs)
		You'll never come to Dorset.

The plane roars into life.  Almásy watches it taxi away - then heads 
back to continue with his packing up.


172*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

MADOX SHOOTS HIMSELF BEHIND THE ALTAR IN THE ROOM.  The Patient's 
stertorous breathing, each intake accompanied by a small noise, a note, 
suddenly stops.  Then steadies again.  He appears to be alone.


173	EXT.    GARDEN.    NIGHT.

Kip is in the tent, looking out of the flap, waiting for Hana.


174*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Kip walks in looking for Hana.


174a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Kip enters, sees Hana is not with the Patient, hears his uneven 
breathing, then goes out.  From the shadows of the room, CARAVAGGIO 
shifts position.   He's slumped on the floor, staring at the man prone 
in the bed.


174b*.	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Into her bedroom, Kip can't find her there either.  He turns to go, 
walking down the wooden stairs, until her voice stops him in his 
tracks.  She's in the shadows of the eaves.

			HANA
		Sometimes I need you to find me.


175*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.     NIGHT.

The Patient's eyes open to see Caravaggio at the morphine.

			THE PATIENT
		Hana tells me you're leaving.

			CARAVAGGIO
				(preparing the injection)
		There are going to be trials, they
		want me to interpret, don't they
		know I'm allergic to courtrooms?

			THE PATIENT
		We shall miss you.

He delivers the injection.  The Patient sighs.  Caravaggio takes off 
his jacket.  A pistol is stuck in his waistband.  The Patient sees it.

			CARAVAGGIO
		So, I come across the Hospital Convoy
				(holds up the syringe)
		I was looking for this stuff, and some
		nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me
		about you and Hana, hiding in a
		monastery, in purdah, whatever it is -
		retreat -
				(he administers his own injection, 
using his teeth grip the sleeve)
		how you'd come in from the Desert
		and you were burned and you didn't
		know your name but you knew the
		words to every song there was and
		you had one possession -
				(picks it up)
		#NAME?
		full of letters and cuttings, and then
		I knew it must be you.

			THE PATIENT
		Me?

			CARAVAGGIO
		I'd seen you writing in that book.  
		At the Embassy in Cairo, when I
		had thumbs and you had a face.
		And a name.

			THE PATIENT
		I see.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Before you went over to the Germans,
		before you got Rommel's spy across the
		desert and inside British headquarters.
		He took some pretty good photographs -
		I saw mine in that torture room in 
		Tobruk, so they made an impression.  

			THE PATIENT
		And you thought you'd come and
		settle the score?

			CARAVAGGIO
		You were the only man who knew
		the desert well enough, the only
		man who would cross seventeen
		hundred miles of nothing.

			THE PATIENT
		I had to get back to the desert. I made a
		promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.

			CARAVAGGIO
		What did you say?

			THE PATIENT
		The rest meant nothing to me.

			CARAVAGGIO
		There was a result to what you did.
		It wasn't just another expedition.
				(holds up hands)
		It did this.  If the British hadn't
		unearthed your nosey photographer
		in Cairo thousands of people could
		have died.

			THE PATIENT
		Thousands of people did die, just
		different people.

			CARAVAGGIO
		But you were among the British, they 
		were your friends - why betray them?

			THE PATIENT
				(a bitter laugh)
		Is that what you thought?  That I
		betrayed the British?  The British
		betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.


176*.	EXT.   BASECAMP AT CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   1939.   DAY.

Almásy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his 
Herodotus onto a sheet of paper.  He looks up at the sound of Clifton's 
approaching Steerman.  He folds up the map and sticks it inside one of 
Clifton's CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES and lodges it between the rocks.

 
176a*.	INT.    STEERMAN.    DAY.

Clifton is flying the STEERMAN up to Gilf Kebir.  From the air it's 
possible to make out Almásy scrambling down from the ridge towards 
where the stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last of the 
materials from the Cave of Swimmers.  Almásy waves in recognition and 
welcome.


177	EXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   DAY.

Almásy watches as the plane drops towards him, shielding his eyes 
against the sun.  the plane bounces along the runway, not quite 
landing.  Almásy continues packing the equipment.

Almásy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly HEADING STRAIGHT 
TOWARDS HIM.  He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run.  He dives at 
the ground.  THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS 
OVER AND OVER, the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the 
prostrate Almásy.  He gets to his feet and starts to run towards the 
wreckage.

A blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire.  Almásy 
pulls away the debris to find  GEOFFREY - SLUMPED, NECK BROKEN, BLOODY.  
He tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his ABSOLUTE 
horror, KATHARINE, STARING GRIMLY AHEAD, UNABLE TO MOVE.  He's frantic.

			ALMÁSY
		Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine -
		what are you doing here?

			KATHARINE
				(eyes rolling, an incredible weariness)
		I can't move.  I can't get out.

Almásy starts to pull at the wreck around her.
DURING THIS -

			ALMÁSY
		Why did he bring you?

			KATHARINE
		A surprise, he said.

Almásy inspects Clifton, tries to find a pulse.  The smoke circles 
around them.  Katharine looks at her husband.

			KATHARINE
		Poor Geoffrey.  He knew.  He must
		have known all the time.  He was
		shouting - I love you, Katharine, 
		I love you so much.  Is he badly hurt?
		His neck is odd.

Almásy puts his arm around Katharine to try and pull her clear.  She 
can't stand the pain.

			KATHARINE
		Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.

			ALMÁSY
		We've got to get you out of here.

			KATHARINE
		It hurts too much.

			ALMÁSY
				(can't bear to hurt her)
		I know, darling, I'm sorry.

The smoke thickens.  He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes 
Katharine to gasp, then pass out.  They slip haphazardly to the ground, 
cushioned a little by the sand.  He lifts her gently into his arms and 
carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back.  
THE PLANE SUDDENLY ERUPTS IN FLAMES.  Almásy dashes into the fire, 
disappearing into the smoke before emerging with Clifton over his 
shoulder, fireman's-lift style.


178	EXT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

He has WRAPPED KATHARINE IN THE SILK FOLDS OF HER PARACHUTE and emerges 
from the near the familiar cleft in the rock, struggling with the 
exertion of the climb as they approach the Cave of Swimmers.  He has a 
large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack, and is loaded 
like a pack horse.  Katharine opens her eyes.

			KATHARINE
				(whispering)
		Why did you hate me?

			ALMÁSY
		What?

			KATHARINE
		Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

			ALMÁSY
		Don't talk.

			KATHARINE
				(gasping)
		You speak so many bloody languages
		and you never want to talk.

They stagger on.  He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck.  
It's saffron, leaking from a silver THIMBLE which hangs from a black 
ribbon.

			ALMÁSY
				(overwhelmed)
		You're wearing the thimble.

			KATHARINE
		Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it.
		I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.

Almásy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the 
pain of it.  They approach the Cave.


179*.	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Almásy comes through in shadows, carrying Katharine, blocking out the 
light that pours into the entrance of the cave.  Once inside, he sets 
her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of blankets and the parachute.  
He turns on his flashlight.

			KATHARINE
		It's so cold.

			ALMÁSY
		I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire.
		I'll be back.

			KATHARINE
				(panicking suddenly)
		Don't leave me!

			ALMÁSY
		I'm just going to find things for the fire.


179a*.	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

Almásy returns with the stocks of ACACIA TWIGS the Expedition had 
cached.  As he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting 
across the walls.

			KATHARINE
		Shall we be all right?

			ALMÁSY
		Yes.  Absolutely.

			KATHARINE
				(with a laugh)
		Oh dear.

			ALMÁSY
				(as he works)
		Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken
		your ankle and I'm going to have to try
		and bind it.  I think your wrist might be
		broken, too - and some ribs, which is
		why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm
		going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given
		all the traffic in the desert these days
		I should bump into one army or another
		before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes
		and his camel.  And then I'll be back 
		and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.

The fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.

			KATHARINE
		Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die
		here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert.
		I've always had a rather elaborate funeral
		in mind, with particular hymns.  Very
		English.  And I know exactly where I
		want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where
		I grew up.  With a view of the sea.  So
		promise me you'll come back for you.

			ALMÁSY
		I promise I'll come back.  I promise
		I'll never leave you.  And there's
		plenty of water and food.  You
		can have a party.

He kisses her tenderly.  Pulls out his HERODOTUS and lays it beside 
her.  Then he puts down the FLASHLIGHT.

			ALMÁSY
		And a good read.
				(of the flashlight battery)
		Don't waste it.

			KATHARINE
		Thank you.
				(clouds over)
		Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know
		he's dead.

			ALMÁSY
		I'm sorry, Katharine.

			KATHARINE
		I know.

			ALMÁSY
		Every night I cut out my heart but 
		in the morning it was full again.

He's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife.  As he starts to 
bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the 
pain.

			ALMÁSY
		Tell me about your garden.

			KATHARINE
				(tries to focus)
		Our Garden, our garden - not so much
		the garden, but the copse alongside it,
		wild, a secret way plunging down to the
		shore and then nothing but water
		between you and France.  The Devil's
		Chimney it was called -
				(he pulls tight on the binding)
		The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.
				(he kisses her)
		Darling.  My darling.


180	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

ALMÁSY BURYING CLIFTON.  He's dug a narrow trench, and now he goes to 
the body.  Clifton's face is oil stained, bloody.  Almásy takes his 
handkerchief and, pouring his precious water into it, CLEANS GEOFFREY'S 
FACE.

			THE PATIENT'S (O/S)
		Seventy miles, north - north west.
		I had Madox's compass.  A man can
		walk in the desert as fast as a camel.
		That's about two and a half miles an hour.


181	EXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

Alamos's walking.  He slides and collapses as he misjudges a dune, gets 
up, stumbles on.

			THE PATIENT (O/S)
		I stopped at noon and at twilight.
		Three days there, I told her, then
		three hours back by jeep.  Don't go
		anywhere.  I'll be back.


182	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAWN.

He trudges on, his eyes opening and closing.  He's singing to keep 
awake.  Darktown Strutter's Ball. - I'll be down to get you in the 
taxi, honey...  He does a little shuffle.  Looks behind at the crazy 
trail of his footprints.


182a*.	EXT.    THE CHOTT.    DAWN.

A vast flat expanse of dried salt lake.  A remorseless horizon.  Almasy 
walks, checking the compass, squinting at the sun.  then he sees a 
cloud of dust traveling across the horizon.  It comes closer moving at 
great speed, reveals itself.  An OSTRICH.


183	EXT.    WELL.    DAY.

Almásy lowers himself by an old rope down into a gully.  He approaches 
a pile of stones and removes them to reveal a brackish pool of filthy 
water.  He drinks, pouring water over his head, grimacing at the taste, 
but parched too.


184*.	EXT.    APPROACHING EL TAJ.    DAY.

Almásy gets his first sight of the fortress town of EL TAJ and sinks to 
his knees, in relief and exhaustion.  Then he gets up and trudges 
towards the town.  A CORPORAL with a rifle in his hands appears.


184a*.	INT.    EL TAJ.    DAY.

The Corporal brings Almásy into a square.  A young OFFICER appears from 
the shadows of his office.  His JEEP is parked in the shade.

			OFFICER
		Good morning!

			ALMÁSY
		Could I trouble you for some water?

			OFFICER
				(registering the accented English)
		Yes, of course.
				(the Corporal has a water bottle,
hands it to Almásy)
		So, golly, where have you come from?

			ALMÁSY
				(gulping the water)
		I desperately need a jeep.  There's
		been an accident.

			OFFICER
		I see.

			ALMÁSY
				(brain racing)
		No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need
		a doctor too, to come with me, can I
		take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course -
		and some morphine and...
				(calculating)
		Seventy miles - I can be back
		here by dusk.

			OFFICER
		Do you have your papers, sir?

			ALMÁSY
		What?

			OFFICER
		If I could just see some identification.

			ALMÁSY
		Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me,
		I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a
		woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir,
		in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a
		member of the Royal Geographical
		Society.

			OFFICER
		Right.  And what's your name, sir?

			ALMÁSY
		Count Laszlo de Almásy.

The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.

			OFFICER
		Almásy - would you mind just
		spelling that for me?  What
		nationality would that be?

			ALMÁSY
		Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying -
		my wife! - is dying seventy miles from
		here.  I have been walking for three
		days!  I don't want to spell my name, 
		I want you to give me this jeep!

			OFFICER
				(writing)
		I understand you are agitated -
		perhaps you would like to sit down
		while I radio back to HQ -

			ALMÁSY
				(snapping)
		No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody,
		just give me the fucking jeep!

Almásy sets on the Officer, hauling him by the lapels, but them 
immediately loses his balance.  As he stumbles up he gets the stock of 
the Corporal's RIFLE across his head, KNOCKING HIM TO THE GROUND.


185*.	EXT.   EL TAJ STREET.    DAY.

Almásy, head pounding, is in the back of the jeep, chained to the 
tailgate.  He's desperate.  The Corporal is driving.

			ALMÁSY
				(shouting hoarse)
		Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me
		out of here - there's a woman dying,
		there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!

			CORPORAL
		Shut-up!

			ALMÁSY
		Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you,
		please listen to me, this is a terrible
		mistake.  Just stop, please, and
		listen to me.  My wife is dying.

			CORPORAL
		Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen
		to another word from you I'll
		give you a fucking good hiding.

			ALMÁSY
		Fritz?  What are you talking about?
		Who's Fritz?

			CORPORAL
		That's your name innit?  Count
		Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck?
		What's that supposed to be then, Irish?

Almásy, berserk, starts to yank at his chains, screaming.

			ALMÁSY
		Let me out, let me out, let me out -
		Katharine!  Katharine!


186	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

Katharine has been writing in the Herodotus.  The torchlight FLICKERS.  
She shakes the torch.   It FLICKERS again.  Then goes out.  Absolute 
BLACKNESS.  The sound of her trembling breath.


187*.	EXT.    A TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

A TRAIN scuttles through the desert.


187a*.	INT.    THE TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

Almásy is HANDCUFFED to the metal grille of the goods compartment.  
He's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little 
bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some Arabs, some 
Italians.

A SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving 
behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across 
his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gulliver's Travels.  Almásy is in 
complete despair to be on the train.  He tries to move, but he's locked 
tight to the grille.  He rattles the cuffs against the metal.

			ALMÁSY
		Excuse me.
				(the Soldier looks up)
		I also need to use the lavatory.

			SOLDIER
		You'll have to wait.
				(calls up the corridor)
		Sarge!  Jerry wants to use the lav -
		says it's urgent.

			ALMÁSY
		Where are we going, please?

			SOLDIER
		To the coast.  Benghazi.  Soon be there.
		Get a boat home.  You'll be all right.

ALMÁSY CAN'T BEAR THIS NEWS.  The SERGEANT returns.

			SERGEANT
		What's up?

			ALMÁSY
		Cramps.  It's urgent.

			SERGEANT
		Go on then - you take him.


188	INT.    THE TRAIN CORRIDOR.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

The Soldier pushes Almásy along the corridor.  They arrive outside the 
lavatory.  The Soldier is distracted for a split second.  Enough for 
Almásy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he KICKS 
HIM REPEATEDLY in the head.  He wraps his cuffs around the Soldier's 
neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny, 
efficient and sickening snap.

He finds the KEY to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and 
drags him into the empty lavatory.


189	INT.    TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.

Almásy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the Kitchen carriage, 
where Arabs sweat over the boiler.  He pulls open the back door only to 
surprise a GUARD, who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset.  Almásy 
SHOOTS HIM with his stole rifle.  He clambers over the guard rail and 
leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset.


190	EXT.    RAILWAY TRACK.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.

Almásy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track, 
THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY from the dying Katharine Clifton, no way now 
of saving her.  He is a tiny speck in the vast desert.  His heart 
broken.  He sinks to his knees in despair.


191*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

The Patient is exhausted.  He has said aloud what has tortured him.  
His failure to save Katharine.  He looks at Caravaggio.

			THE PATIENT
		So yes.  She died because of me.
		Because I loved her.  Because I 
		had the wrong name.


192	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.

Kip is working at a BLACKSMITH'S FORGE in the Stables.  He is heating 
pieces of metal.  He has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet, 
a rifle, a piece of bomb casting.

	Hana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind.

			HANA
		What are you up to?

			KIP
		That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon -
		Zamzammah - remember?  That was 
		made out of the metal of ordinary things.  
		I want to make an ordinary thing
		out of guns.

His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.

			KIP
		When I went to England I was amazed at
		what went on, the waste - I'd been taught
		to re-use everything, the dung from a cow
		to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a
		typewriter - India could live for a 
		hundred years on what I saw thrown away.

			HANA
		I should go to the house, get breakfast.

			KIP
		The lamp was burning all night in his
		room.  Caravaggio was there with him.

She goes to kiss him.   He is over the fire and protests.

			KIP
		This is hot!

			HANA
				(teasing him)
		Nya-nya-nya!


193*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine.

			CARAVAGGIO
		And did you never see Katharine?  You
		never got back to the Cave?

			THE PATIENT
		Yes, I got back there finally to keep
		my promise.  To come back for her.
		And then of course I couldn't... I
		couldn't even do that properly.


194	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.

Kip hammers the metal into its new shape.  He stops, distracted by 
something he's listening to on his crystal set.  It's new he seems not 
to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on Japan.  A NEW KIND OF 
BOMB.

THE METAL GLOWS A VIVID RED ON THE ANVIL.
Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing 
column of steam.


195*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Caravaggio sits by the Patient.

			CARAVAGGIO
		You get to the morning and the
		poison leaks away, doesn't it?
		Black nights, fucking black nights,
		when you want to howl like a dog.
		I thought I would kill you.  You
		killed my friends, you ruined my
		hands.  But the girl was always
		here, like some Guardian Angel.

			THE PATIENT
		You can't kill me.  I died years ago.

			CARAVAGGIO
		No, now I can't kill you.

Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and POINTS A 
GUN AT HIM.  Caravaggio is taken by surprise.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip - what are - ?

			KIP
		Stay out of this.

			THE PATIENT
		Kip?

			KIP
		I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother
		always said I was a fool.  Never trust the
		British, he said: the deal-makers, the
		map-makers; never shake hands with them.

			THE PATIENT
		What are you talking about?

			KIP
		What have I been doing all this time?
		Do you know how many mines I've seen? -
		more mines than there are soldiers, more -
		how many mines we've put in the ground
		ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped
		out of the sky.  And now this.

He approaches the bed.  Caravaggio tries to intervene.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip, listen -

Kip sings the rifle at him, KNOCKING HIM to the floor.

			KIP
		I said keep out of this!

He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head, 
dropping the set onto the bed.  The Patient listens, coughing.

			KIP
		Can you hear?  Can you hear what they're
		celebrating?  I listened to you, Uncle.
		Sitting at your feet - always sitting at
		somebody's feet - trying to learn.  The
		right way to hold a teacup, otherwise
		you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie -
		as if everything can be explained in
		terms of a cricket bat and an accent.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip -

			KIP
		Kip! - it's not even my name because
		you can't say it.  Kirpal Singh Bhuller
		is my name.

Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Well, then ask him his name!

			HANA
				(getting in between Kip and the Patient)
		What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening?
		Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.

			KIP
		They're excited!  They're happy about
		destroying a whole city.  Would they
		do that to a White Man's City?  Never!

			THE PATIENT
				(pulling off the earphones)
		Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Kip, listen, he lost everything because
		he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me,
		I'm more English than he is!

Kip levels the gun at the Patient.  Then breaks it open, throws it down 
on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to 
leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay... Hiroshima... and from 
different voices - It was beautiful!  just beautiful!  Bang! the 
biggest bang you ever saw!


196	EXT.    KIP'S TENT.    LATE DAY.

Hana approaches.  Kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped.  She sees 
his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name.  It's like a 
confessional.  The flap between them, the man in shadows, Hana 
crouched, forlorn.

			HANA
		Kip.  Kip.  It's me.
				(no response)
		Why?  It's another bomb.  However
		big, what's the difference?  There've
		been so many bombs.  What about
		Coventry?  What about Dresden?
		Where were those cities?
				(no response)
		I don't understand.  Let me come in.

The shadow doesn't move.  Hana is at a loss.


197	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

The Patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes, 
squints into the darkness and sees A FIGURE hovering against the wall.  
He's in the Cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving, 
he's seeing the Swimmer.

KIP - bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at 
the foot of the Patient's bed.


198	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Kip comes into the room.  Hana sits in the corner.  She is nervous of 
him, his look, his intensity.

			KIP
		Will you come with me?

			HANA
		Of course.  When?

			KIP
		I mean home.  India.

			HANA
		Kip... I -

			KIP 
				(interrupting this)
		I know - here I am always a brown man,
		there you would be always a white woman.

			HANA
		Is that what you think?  Is that what
		you think I think?

			KIP
		It's what I've learned.

			HANA
		I'm thinking about your heart, not
		your skin.  And how to reach it.  And
		that I don't think I can.  A bomb
		has ruined us, just not the bomb
		I thought would ruin us.

She stands, goes to him.

			HANA
		I've clung to you.  I've clung to you.
		Kip.  Life  a raft.  

			KIP 
				(clinging to her)
		Then come with me.


199	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Next morning and Kip has attached what he was making in the forge - A 
NEW HANDLE - to the pump.  Now he works it, producing a steady stream 
of water.  His motorbike is against the wall.  He goes to it.  
Caravaggio is watching.  He hugs Kip, wrapping his arms around the boy 
like a bear.


199a*.	EXT.    HANA'S VEGETABLE GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA stands by her Vegetable Garden.  Kip stops the motorbike.  She 
goes to him, stands, FASTENS THE TOP BUTTON of his coat.  You feel she 
might jump on the seat behind him.  But she doesn't.

			HANA
		I'll always go back to that church.
		Look at my painting.

			KIP
		I'll always go back to that church.

			HANA
		So one day we'll meet.

He nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.


200	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana comes in carrying FLOWERS and sets them down on the table next to 
a clutch of MORPHINE AMPOULES.  She picks up the hypodermic to prepare 
his injection.  She takes a phial.  THE PATIENT REACHES OUT AND PUSHES 
TWO MORE TOWARDS HER.   THEIR EYES MEET, THEN HE SHOVELS ANOTHER, THEN 
ALL OF THEM.  She looks at him.  IT'S A MASSIVE, LETHAL DOSE.

Hana starts to prepare the injection, her eyes filling with tears.  The 
Patient nods, smiles, whispers.

			THE PATIENT
		Thank you.  Thank you.

She kisses him, gently on the mouth.  He closes his eyes.

			THE PATIENT
		Read to me, will you?  Read me to sleep.


201*.	EXT.(NEAR THE) BASECAMP. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. 1942. DAY.

The familiar cleft in the rocks.  A PLANE is coming in to land.


202	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

A flashlight flickers in the cave.  ALMÁSY APPEARS.

KATHARINE'S CORPSE lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of silk 
and blankets.  The chill of the cave has preserved her.  She could be 
asleep.  She clutches the Herodotus.

			ALMÁSY
		Katharine, my darling.

He sobs, whispering to her.  He's terribly cold, exhausted.  He slips 
underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes.

			ALMÁSY
		I'm so tired.


203*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

The Patient is slipping away.  Hana is reading from the last pages of 
the Herodotus where KATHARINE HAS WRITTEN IN THE MARGINS.

			HANA
		My darling, I'm waiting for you - how
		long is a day in the dark, or a week?

The Patient looks across AND WHAT HE SEES IS KATHARINE BESIDE HIM IN 
THE BED, SMILING, STROKING HIS HEAD, SPEAKING TO HIM.


204	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

Katharine is writing.  The FLASHLIGHT is faint.  She shivers.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...the fire is gone now, and I'm
		horribly cold.  I really ought to
		drag myself outside but then
		there would be the sun...

She passes the flashlight across the wall, the painted figures dancing 
in the pale light.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		I'm afraid I waste the light on the 
		paintings and on writing these words...


205	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

THE BED IS EMPTY, THE MATTRESS STRIPPED.  Hana stands in the doorway, 
then sees THE HERODOTUS on the bedside table.

She picks it up, goes to the page of Katharine's letter, continues to 
read.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		We die, we die rich with lovers and
		tribes, tastes we have swallowed...


206*.	EXT.    LANE OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

Caravaggio is at the gate to the Monastery.  The TRUCK we saw before is 
waiting with him.  The PARTISAN with his head bandana and shotgun 
remains the same, but now there are CHILDREN in the back and a WOMAN 
sits behind the man, nursing a two-year-old.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hana!  Come on!

He gets up into the BALUSTRADE, tentatively finds his balance, then 
starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence - 
along the long thin line of stone.  The children watch intently.  He 
turns and bows.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...bodies we have entered and swum up
		like rivers, fears we have hidden in
		like this wretched cave...


207*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.

Hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares, 
leaving it all behind.  Then she stops, bends, retrieves A SNAIL SHELL, 
keeps going.  KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.


208	INT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

ALMÁSY SMUDGES KATHARINE'S PALE FACE WITH COLOR.  OCHRE across her 
brow, BLUE on her eyelids, RED on her lips.  He presses his cheek to 
hers, smoothes her hair.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...I want all this marked on my body.
		We are the real countries, not the
		boundaries drawn on maps with the
		names of powerful men...


209*.	EXT.    THE LANE OUTSIDE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.  Hana comes out to the truck, carrying her 
small bundle.  Caravaggio effects some introduction, beginning with the 
woman driver, Gioia.  She and Caravaggio smile like lovers.

			CARAVAGGIO
		Hana - this is Gioia.

Gioia smiles, shakes her hand.  Then Hana meets the others - Gioia's 
brother and wife, their children.   She smiles at them.

			HANA
		Buon' giorno.

			CARAVAGGIO
		She can take you as far as Florence.

			HANA
		I can get in the back.

And she clambers up, sits down between the children.  They exchange 
some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away.  Hana 
takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend 
and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.


210	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Almásy comes out of the cave, carrying the bundle of Katharine in his 
arms, wrapped in the silks of her parachute.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		...I know you will come and carry me
		out into the palace of winds, the rumors
		of water... That's all I've wanted -
		to walk in such a place with you, with
		friends, on earth without maps.


211	EXT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.

THE PLANE growls and complains into the air.


212	INT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.

INSIDE THE COCKPIT:  THE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF THE FILM.  Almásy 
obliterated by goggles and helmet.  Katharine behind him, slumped 
forwards as if sleeping.

Almásy banks across the plateau of the Gilf Kebir and glances down.  In 
a ravine is a sudden OASIS OF WHITE ACACIAS.  He is mesmerized.

And then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the 
desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile.

			KATHARINE (O/S)
		The lamp's gone out and I'm writing
		in the darkness...

Almásy, the English Patient, begins to sing - Szerelem, Szerelem - 
until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament 
heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost.

The sound of gun fire...


THE END.

INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

It's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She
seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist,
dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Oh, hi.

		OLD WOMAN
		(apologetically)
	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
	I'd see --

		RECEPTIONIST
	I think he's in a conference.
	Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry.

		OLD WOMAN
	Would you just try him?  You never know.
	As long as I'm here.  You never know.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Of course.  Please have a seat.

The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
lap.  She stares politely straight ahead.

		RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
		(quietly into headset)
	It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just
	-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's
	old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
		(to old woman)
	I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
	It's a crazy time of year for us.

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
corner.  Its ornaments are holograms.

		OLD WOMAN
	This book -- It's essential that people
	read it because --
		(gravely, patting the
		 manuscript)
	-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Maybe after the holidays then.

INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY

The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When
she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a
slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She
sits in the chair; it rises.

INT. TUBE -DAY

The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other
chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over New York City in the tube.
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
It's called:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits
follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER

Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25,
can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are
shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and
Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's
decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		CLEMENTINE
		(approaching reception area)
	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
	Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right
	with you.

Clementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks
up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.

INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Mary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door.

		MIERZWIAK (O.S.)
	Yes?

Mary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,
professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

		MARY
	Howard, your one o'clock.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.

She smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally
clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to
leave.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
		(looking up)
	Mary...

		MARY
		(turning back)
	Yes?

		MIERZWIAK
	Order me a pastrami for after?

		MARY
	Cole slaw, ice tea?

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding)
	Thanks.

		MARY
	Welcome, Howard.

She smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall,
spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

		STAN
	Boo.

		MARY
	Hi.

She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.

		STAN
	Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

He leans in to kiss her.  She cranes her neck to keep him
off.

		MARY
		(reprimanding whisper)
	Stan... c'mon...

		STAN
	Sorry.  I just --

		MARY
		(somewhat guiltilly)
	It's just...y'know... I mean...

		STAN
	I know.  Anyway --

		MARY
	Anyway, I've got to do my tap
	dance here.

She indicates the door to the reception area.  Stan nods.

		STAN
	See you later, alligator.

		MARY
	'kay.

		STAN
	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for
	Mierzwiak, would you --

		MARY
	I better do this, Stan.

Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Ms. Kruczynski?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	Hi.

After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary
leads her down the hall, not looking back.

		MARY
		(professionally courteous)
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.

Clementine enters the office.  Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
closes the door, leaving them alone.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwiak
sits across from her.  He smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Well, why don't you tell me what's going
	on?  Do you mind if I turn this on?

He indicates a tape recorder.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't care.

He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Well, I've been having a bad time of it
	with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
	You guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you
	guess you're having a bad time with hm?

		CLEMENTINE
	What?  No.  I don't like the term
	boyfriend.  It's so gay.

Mierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
throughout.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Maybe gay isn't the right word.  But,
	anyway, it's been rough with him...
	whatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My
	significant other... heh heh.  And I
	guess on a certain level, I want to break
	it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
	this constant questioning and re
	questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give
	it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do
	I expect?  Relationships require work.
	You know the drill.  The thing that I
	keep coming back to is, I'm not getting
	any younger, I want to have a baby... at
	some point... maybe... right?  So then I
	think I should settle -- which is not
	necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
	a good guy.  It's not really settling.
	Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of
	movies, y'know?  That I have some
	completely unrealistic notion of what a
	relationship can be.  But then I think,
	no, this is what I really want, so I
	should allow myself the freedom to go out
	and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?
	But then I think he is a good guy and...
	It's complicated.  Y'know?

		MIERZWIAK
	I think I know. I think we can help.  Why
	don't you start by telling me about your
	relationship.  Everything you can think
	of.  Everything about him.  Everything
	about you.  And we'll take it from there.

She nods, thinks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION

SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.  He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.  The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.  Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.  Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER

Joel talks on a phone.  The wind howls around him.  He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.

		JOEL
	Hi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not
	feeling well this morning.  No.  Food
	poisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so
	long to call in, but I've been vomiting.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He
passes an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each
other.

Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.

Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

		JOEL
	January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work
	and took the train out to Montauk.
		(thinks)
	It's cold.
		(thinks some more)
	The sky is gray.
		(thinks some more)
	I don't know what else to say.  Nothing
	happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi
	last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to
	fall into our old familiar sex life so
	easily.  Like no time has passed.  After
	two years apart suddenly we're talking
	about getting together again.  I guess
	that's good.

He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She
stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes.

		JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	If I'm constitutionally incapable of
	making eye-contact with a woman I don't
	know.  I guess I'd better get back to
	Naomi.

Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window.

Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.

INT. DINER - DAY

It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel
glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth
and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.

		WAITRESS
	Coffee?

		CLEMENTINE
	God, yes.  You've saved my life!

The waitress pours the coffee.

		WAITRESS
	You know what you want yet?

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	Ain't that the question of the century.

The waitress is not amused.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

		WAITRESS
	Yeah.  We're having a run on it.

The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling)
	And some cream, please.

Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's
before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances
up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the
title.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.

INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching
him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling over the rumble)
	Hi!

Joel looks over.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.

		CLEMENTINE
	Why?

		JOEL
	Why what?

		CLEMENTINE
	Why are you sorry?  I just said hi.

		JOEL
	No, I didn't know if you were talking to
	me, so...

She looks around the empty car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?

		JOEL
		(embarrassed)
	Well, I didn't want to assume.

		CLEMENTINE
	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the
	leap and assume someone is talking to you
	in an otherwise empty car.

		JOEL
	Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi.

Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't
	have to scream.  Not that I don't need to
	scream sometimes, believe me.
		(pause)
	But I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to write or something.

		JOEL
	No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really
	think of much to say probably.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.  So...

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.

		JOEL
	I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
	here.  I didn't mean to --

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to --

		JOEL
	It's okay, really.

		CLEMENTINE
	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
	I have a long trip ahead of me.
		(sits across aisle from Joel)
	How far are you going?  On the train, I
	mean, of course.

		JOEL
	Rockville Center.

		CLEMENTINE
	Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds?

		JOEL
	The weirder part is I think actually I
	recognize you.  I thought that earlier in
	the diner.  That's why I was looking at
	you.  You work at Borders, right?

		CLEMENTINE
	Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God.
	Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's
	me: book slave there for, like, five
	years now.

		JOEL
	Really?  Because --

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit
	right now.

		JOEL
	-- because I go there all the time.  I
	don't think I ever saw you before.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as
	much as is humanly possible.  You have a
	cell phone?  I need to quit right this
	minute.  I'll call in dead.

		JOEL
	I don't have one.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy
	before me.

		JOEL
	I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an
	impression on me, that's why I was pretty
	sure I recognized you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah, the hair.
		(pulls a strand in front of her
		 eyes, studies it)
	Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The
	color.  Snappy name, huh?

		JOEL
	I like it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
	wondering.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in --

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?

		JOEL
	I can't remember.

		CLEMENTINE
	Anyway, this company makes a whole line
	of colors with equally snappy names.  Red
	Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
	That'd be a job, coming up with those
	names.  How do you get a job like that?
	That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.

		JOEL
	I don't really know how --

		CLEMENTINE
	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

		JOEL
	You think that could possibly be a full
	time job?  How many hair colors could
	there be?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Someone's got that job.
		(excited)
	Agent Orange!  I came up with that one.
	Anyway, there are endless color
	possibilities and I'd be great at it.

		JOEL
	I'm sure you would.

		CLEMENTINE
	My writing career!  Your hair written by
	Clementine Kruczynski.
		(thought)
	The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

		JOEL
	You sure?  That doesn't sound --

		CLEMENTINE
	I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their
	colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too
	old for this.  But it keeps me from
	having to develop an actual personality.
	I apply my personality in a paste.  You?

		JOEL
	Oh, I doubt that's the case.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
	know, do you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I got it.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	My name's Clementine, by the way.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't
	do that; you're trying to be nice.

		JOEL
	I don't know any jokes about your name.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound?

		JOEL
	I don't know what that means.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?

		JOEL
	I'm nut nuts.

		CLEMENTINE
		(singing)
	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
	darlin' Clementine?  No?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It
	means "merciful", right?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a
	vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

		JOEL
	See, I wouldn't think that about you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Why wouldn't you think that about me?

		JOEL
	Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't
	know.  I was... You seemed nice, so --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other
	adjectives?  There's careless and snotty
	and overbearing and argumentative...
	mumpish.

		JOEL
	Well, anyway... Sorry.

They sit in silence for a while.

		CLEMENTINE
	I just don't think "nice" is a
	particularly interesting thing to be.

The conductor enters the car.

		CONDUCTOR
	Tickets.

Joel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches
it and hands it back.

		CLEMENTINE
	What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an
	adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,
	sort of.

The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is
	pandering.  Cowardly.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	And life is more interesting than that.
	Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is...
	someday.
		(to conductor)
	I know it's here.

The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I don't need nice.  I don't need myself
	to be it and I don't need anyone else to
	be it at me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Damn it.  DAMN IT!
		(there it is)
	Oh.  Here.

She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He
punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

		CONDUCTOR
	Next stop Southampton.

The conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky.
She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while.
The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody
gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel?  It's Joel, right?

		JOEL
	Yes?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it
	yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever,
	I'm a little out of sorts today.

		JOEL
	That's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
		(stares out window)
	My embarrassing admission is I really
	like that you're nice.  Right now,
	anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to
	the next what I'm going to like.  But
	right now I'm glad you said, "that's
	okay" to me.  That was nice of you.

		JOEL
	It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some
	stuff I need to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just...
		(stands, throws bag over
		 shoulder)
	Take care, then.

		JOEL
		(pulling journal from
		 briefcase)
	Probably see you at the book store.

		CLEMENTINE
		(heading toward other end of
		 car)
	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.

Clementine sits and stares out the window.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has
inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His
head is immersed in his journal.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out
the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads
to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented
scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in.

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold.
He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

		JOEL
	Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, that's okay.  Thanks, though.

		JOEL
	You're sure?  It's cold.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't want to take you out of your way.

		JOEL
	It's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?

He pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive.

		JOEL
	Where do you live?

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not a stalker or anything, right?

		JOEL
	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were,
	but no.

		CLEMENTINE
	You can't be too careful.  I've been
	stalked.  I've been told I'm highly
	stalkable.  I don't need that.

		JOEL
	I'm not a stalker.

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	You know Wilmont?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wilmont.  Near the high school.

Joel turns.  They drive in silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
	nutso.  I'm not really.

		JOEL
	It's okay.  I didn't think you were.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you like bookstores, huh?

		JOEL
	I like to read.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I can't remember that album very
	well.  I remember liking it.  But --

		CLEMENTINE
	The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent
	most of the train ride trying to
	remember.  "Till you're full of rag water
	and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill
	out/Over the side to anyone who'll
	listen."  Remember?

		JOEL
	Sort of, um...

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember?  "And you take on the dreams of
	the ones who have slept there/And I'm
	lost in the window/I hide on the
	stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in
	your hat..."
		(starts to cry)
	Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.

		JOEL
	What?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm just a bit of a wreck.  "I sleep in
	your hat" makes me cry.
		(pointing to a house)
	Me.

Joel pulls over.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanks very much.  That was very nice of
	you.

		JOEL
	Well, I wouldn't want to be --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already
	told you that.
		(pause)
	Anyway.  See Ya.

Clementine opens the car door.

		JOEL
	Take care.

		CLEMENTINE
		(turning back)
	Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have
	lots of drinks.  And I could --

		JOEL
	Um --

		CLEMENTINE
	Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm
	embarrassed.  Good night, Joel.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries
to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at
the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We
see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing
drinks and chatting.

		CLEMENTINE
	Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about
	four years.  It's really cheap.  My
	downstairs neighbor is old so she's
	quiet, which is great.  And the
	landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
	great, and I have a little porch in the
	back, which is great, because I can read
	there, and listen to my crickets and...

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Two blue ruins...

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You like that?

		JOEL
	Very much.

		CLEMENTINE
	This... someone gave that to me, just
	like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like
	crows.  I think I used to be a crow.

She caws and hands Joel a drink.

		JOEL
	Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound.

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you believe in that stuff?
	Reincarnation?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription
	on the back.
		(takes it off the wall, reads:)
	The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust
	of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my
	heart/A change of mood/And saved some
	part/Of a day I rued.

		JOEL
	Frost?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
	lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems
	strictly grade school to me.  But this
	made me cry for some reason.  Maybe
	because it is grade school.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	It's pretty.

		CLEMENTINE
	I miss grade school.  I don't know why
	I'm calling it grade school all of a
	sudden.  When I went we called it
	elementary school.  But I like grade
	school better.  Sounds like something
	someone from the forties would call it.
	I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore
	hats.  Anyway, cheers!

		JOEL
	Cheers.

They click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and
pulls her boots off.

		CLEMENTINE
	God, that feels so fucking good.  Take
	yours off.

		JOEL
	I'm fine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.

Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes
her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Ready for another?

		JOEL
	No, I'm okay for now.

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

		JOEL
	What do you want to hear?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	You pick it.

		JOEL
	You just say.  I'm not really --

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	I don't know!  I can't see them from
	here, Joel!  Just pick something good.

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick
	good.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.

		JOEL
	Well, I should probably get going.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, stay.  Just for a little while.
		(opens her eyes, brightly)
	Refill?

		JOEL
	No.  I --

		CLEMENTINE
	I know a man who needs a refill.

She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
kitchen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where
	would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,
	and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think
	about that.

She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's
drink and a refill for herself.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Drink up, young man.  It'll make the
	whole seduction part less repugnant.

Joel looks a little alarmed.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'm just kidding.  C'mon.

She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches
her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles
drunkenly at him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

		JOEL
	Yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
	telling me I'm psychic.  She should know.
	Do you believe in that stuff?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  But sometimes I have
	premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe
	that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,
	you think something and then it happens,
	or you think a word and then someone says
	it?  Y'know?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my
	feeling about it.  It's hard to know.
	Like, okay, but how many times do I think
	something and it doesn't happen?  That's
	what you're saying, right?  You forget
	about those times.  Right?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I guess.

		CLEMENTINE
		(dreamy beat)
	But I think I am.  I like to think I am.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It's helpful to think there's some order
	to things.  You're kind of closed
	mouthed, aren't you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting.
	I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know
	what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.
		(considers this)
	Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm
	always anxious thinking I'm not living my
	life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking
	advantage of every possibility?  Just
	making sure that I'm not wasting one
	second of the little time I have.

		JOEL
	I think about that.

She looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled
	at you before about it.  God, I'm an
	idiot.

		JOEL
	I do have a tendency to use that word too
	much.

		CLEMENTINE
	I like you.  That's the thing about my
	psychic thing.  I think that's my
	greatest psychic power, that I get a
	sense about people.  My problem is I
	never trust it.  But I get it.  And with
	you I get that you're a really good guy.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I
	can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going
	on in your brain.  I can tell.  My
	goal... can I tell you my goal?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
		(ala Paul Simon)
	What's the goal, Joel?
		(laughs)
	My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
	through me?  Do you know what I mean?
	It's like, there's all these emotions and
	ideas and they come quick and they change
	and they leave and they come back in a
	different form and I think we're all
	taught we should be consistent.  Y'know?
	You love someone -- that's it.  Forever.
	You choose to do something with your life
	-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a
	sign of maturity to stick with that and
	see things through.  And my feeling is
	that's how you die, because you stop
	listening to what is true, and what is
	true is constantly changing.  You know?

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't
	need any more reason to do it.  Who knows
	what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're very nice.  God, I have to stop
	saying that.  You're nervous around me,
	huh?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous.  You don't need to be
	nervous around me, though.  I like you.
	Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

		JOEL
	No, not at all.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm
	through with that.  Y'know, if I don't
	love my body, then I'm just lost.  You
	know?

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	With all the wrinkles and scars and the
	general falling apart that's coming
	'round the bend.
		(beat)
	So, I've been seeing this guy...

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(off his reaction)
	Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's
	kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but
	he's really stuck on me, which is
	flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And
	he's, like, a dope, but he says these
	smart and moving things sometimes, out of
	nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's
	the one who gave me that crow photograph.

		JOEL
	Oh, yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went
	up to Boston, because I had this urge to
	lie on my back on the Charles River.  It
	gets frozen this time of year.

		JOEL
	That's scary sounding.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  I used to do it in college and
	I had this urge to go do it again, so I
	got Patrick and we drove all night to get
	there and he was sweet and said nice
	things to me, but I was really
	disappointment to be there with him.
	Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff
	comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with
	him.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	I think so.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't believe in that soulmate crap
	anymore, but... he says so many great
	things.  We like the same writers.  This
	writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
	And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,
	you should come up to the Charles with me
	sometime.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Oh, great!

She sits closer to him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --
	night picnics are different -- and --

		JOEL
		(shy)
	Sounds good.  But right now I should go.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pause)
	You should stay.

		JOEL
	I have to get up early in the morning
	tomorrow, so...

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	Okay.

Joel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone
table, pulls out a notepad.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I would like you to call me.  Would you
	do that?  I would like that.

		JOEL
	Yes.

She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it
in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
then forces himself to speak.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't think your personality comes out
	of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a
	pretty topping.

She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's
surprised and pleased and nervous.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(shyly formal)
	So, I enjoyed meeting you.

		CLEMENTINE
	You'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines and all.

		JOEL
	Okay.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through
the snow and getting in his car.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems
different, somehow foggy and disoriented.

SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER

He arrives at his apartment building and parks.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
street.  There are two dark figures inside.

		VOICE-OVER
	Them.

He hurries inside the building.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight.

		JOEL
	It was snowing.

		VOICE-OVER
	There are two of them.  Couldn't make
	them out.  The orange glow of a
	cigarette.

Joel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk.
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.

		JOEL
	The driver waved.  So casual, friendly.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm like a joke to them.

Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

		VOICE-OVER
	I guess they figure they can act like
	they want.  They don't have to worry
	about me remembering.

He paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts
to change, almost as if it is drying out.

		JOEL
	I might be making a mistake.

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just
	need to learn to live with this.  First
	of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it
	happened.  Those who do not remember
	history are condemned to repeat it.  Who
	said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.
	But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I
	have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.

		JOEL
	Fuck you, Clementine.

The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem
aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it.
It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Pink.
		(beat)
	There was a number on it.  I remember.
	AL 1718?
		(beat)
	I have to follow through with this.  I
	have no choice.

		VOICE-OVER
	The pill was pink, I remember.  It had
	some letters and numbers on it.  What
	were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four
	digits.  I don't like taking pills when I
	don't know what they are.  I have no
	choice.

He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	We're sorry, the number you have
	dialed...
		(beat)
	Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...

		RECORDED VOICE
	We're sorry, the number you have dialed
	is no longer in service.  If you think
	you have reached this recording in error
	-

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Bye.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the
scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment
building door open.  He hears footsteps.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	It's them.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's too late.

His eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes.

BLACK.

He hears a key in his apartment door.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Fuck.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring
transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind.
He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange
now.

		JOEL
	I should maybe talk to you.

		VOICE-OVER
	Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to
	her.

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.

		JOEL
	I love you and if you knew that... if I
	told you what happened...  I'll explain
	everything, what we meant to each other.
	I'll tell you everything about our time
	together.  You'll know everything again
	and...

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I
	wouldn't have to go through this and I
	could tell you everything and it would be
	like you knew and we could rebuild and we
	could be happy again and...

Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man
approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man
seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps
Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it
is and her face lights up.

		JOEL
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
ribs.

		PATRICK
	I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the
	neighborhood.

		CLEMENTINE
	You were not.

		PATRICK
	I was not.

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there,
the scene starts to dry out.
Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's
turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come over after I'm done here?

		PATRICK
	I can't.  I want to, but I have to study.

		CLEMENTINE
	You rat.

		PATRICK
	I really want to, but tonight's
	important.  Test tomorrow.

		JOEL
	How could she have done this to me?  How
	could anyone do this to anyone?

		CLEMENTINE
		(to Patrick)
	You didn't say anything about my hair.

		PATRICK
	It's so cool.  You're by far the most
	sensational person in the room.

		CLEMENTINE
	In the room?

		PATRICK
	In the world.

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

		JOEL
	What's happening here?
		(looks at watch; it's 9:30)
	Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be
	there soon.

Joel turns to leave.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's
weeping as he drives.

		JOEL
	Gotta get home.  How could she do this to
	me?
	How could she not care about what we
	meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What
	a fucking monster she is!

		VOICE-OVER
	Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe
	she's with that guy now!  I'm never going
	to see her again.  I love her so much.
	What a fucking monster she is!

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked
van.  We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.

		JOEL
	Them.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
He's been crying.  He looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street.  He turns back to the New York Street and
spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel sits in the small room with his bags.  A woman across
from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  Her
eyes are red from crying.  Mary, the receptionist, pokes her
head through her window into the waiting room.

		MARY
	Hello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've
	got your stuff.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel walks with his bags behind Mary.

		MARY
		(not looking back)
	How are you today?
		(at lab)
	Here we are.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

Joel enters.  Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab
coat.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be
	in charge of your procedure tonight.

Stan nods professionally.

		STAN
	Mr. Barish.

		JOEL
	How exactly is this going to work
	tonight?

As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
and monotonous.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll start with your most recent
	memories and go backwards -- There is an
	emotional core to each of our memories --
	As we eradicate this core, it starts its
	degradation process --  By the time you
	wake up in the morning, all memories
	we've targeted will have withered and
	disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking.

		JOEL
	Is there any sort of risk of brain
	damage?

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, technically, the procedure itself
	is brain damage, but on a par with a
	night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll
	miss.

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly
he gets it.

		JOEL
	It's happening now!  I'm already in my
	brain.

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, I suppose you are.
		(back in his faded memory
		 persona)
	So, let's get started -- If we want the
	procedure underway tonight, we have some
	work to do.

Joel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches
from the corner.

		STAN
	We use the articles you brought to create
	a map of Clementine in your brain.
	Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to
	trace the map and erase.

		JOEL
	But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's
	already started.  I'm home in my bed.

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to
Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction.

		STAN
	Very good.

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel
studies it.  The machines register his response.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll dispose of these mementos when
	we're done here.  That way you won't be
	confused later by their unexplainable
	presence in your home.

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record
his reaction.

		STAN
	Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs.

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick, do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice
continues.

		STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	-- and check the voltage levels, I'm not
	wiping as clean as I would like here.

Joel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The
machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

		PATRICK
	The voltage looks fine.

		STAN
	Then check the connections.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

		PATRICK
	Does that help?

		STAN
	Yeah, that looks better.  Thanks.

INT. LAB ROOM - DAY

The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  Stan
pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  Mierzwiak smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, your journal.  This will be
	invaluable.

		STAN
		(reading)
	December 15th, 2004.  I met someone
	tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what
	to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's
	amazing.  So alive and spontaneous and
	passionate and sensitive.  Things with
	Naomi and I have been stagnant for so
	long.

The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on.

		STAN'S VOICE
	I think we got this one.  Let's push on.

Joel looks up at the ceiling.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed
home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation.

The scene is fading as he continues to write.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel looks for an office number.  He finds it.  The plaque on
the door reads Lacuna Ltd.  Joel enters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room.  Mary sits in the
reception area.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		JOEL
	My name is Joel Barish.  I have an
	appointment.

		MARY
	Please have a seat.  Dr. Mierzwiak will
	be right with you.

INT. OFFICE HALL - DAY

Mary leads Joel down the hall.

		MARY
		(without turning)
	How are you today?

		JOEL
	Not great.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area.  Joel looks at
the tape recorder.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm sorry you saw one of our notification
	cards.  You never should have.

		JOEL
	Well... I did.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about your relationship
	with Clementine.

		JOEL
		(thinks, then:)
	It was a mess.  I don't know how it got
	this way...

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	It's kind of a dump, don't you think?

Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is checking out the apartment.  Stan monitors the
equipment.

		STAN
		(uninterested)
	It's an apartment.

		PATRICK
	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
	Uninspired.  And there's a stale smell.
	Sort of stuffy.  I don't know.  Stuffy.

		STAN
	Patrick, let's just get through this.  We
	have a long night ahead of us.

		PATRICK
	Yeah.

Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a
moment.  He glances at the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	So who do you think is better-looking, me
	or this guy?

Stan glances sideways at Patrick.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area.

		MIERZWIAK
	So we'll need you to go home and bring in
	everything you ever received from
	Clementine and anything that might remind
	you of her...

The scene is faded and disappearing fast.  It's gone.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL
	So then she just stops calling.

		VOICE-OVER
	I wasn't going to call her.  Not after
	the way she was.

		JOEL
	Any messages, Carmen?

Carmen the receptionist shakes her head.

Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Any messages for me, Carmen.

		CARMEN
	Nothing, Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's bullshit.  She's punishing me for
	being honest with her.

Joel is at his office desk on the phone.

		PHONE MACHINE VOICE
	You have no messages.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in
conversation with someone else.

		JOEL
	Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages?

Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel checks his machine: zero messages.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's it.  I'm just gonna--

Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone.

		VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)
	I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing
	games and --

		RECORDED VOICE
	The number you have dialed has been
	disconnected.

Joel's eyes bug.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's.

		JOEL
	Why would she do that?

		VAGUE RECORDED VOICE
	-- If you think you have reached this
	recording in error, please check your
	number and dial again.

		CARRIE
	I don't know, honey.  It's horrible.

		JOEL
	She's punishing me for being honest.  I
	should just go to her house.

		ROB
	I don't think you should go there, Joel.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.

		CARRIE
	Maybe you need to look at this as a sign
	to move on.  Just make a clean break.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe
	she'd be so goddamn immature!

		ROB
	Joel, look, the thing is --

		CARRIE
		(agitated, interrupting)
	Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog.
	Would you just wait here?  Just a second.

Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and
close the door behind them.  Joel hears a hushed argument
ensue in the hall.  He notices the dog asleep on the floor.
He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it
distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  A
subscription card falls to the floor.  He picks it up and is
about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not
a subscription card at all.  It reads:

 Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her
  memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her
		 again.  Thank you.

		     Lacuna Ltd.
		     610 11th Avenue, NY, NY

Joel stares at the card, incredulous.

Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room.

		CARRIE (CONT'D)
	You weren't supposed to see that.

		JOEL
	They can't erase memories.  It's a joke.
	It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

		CARRIE
	Sweetie, we called the company.

Joel just stands there.

Close-up of a vague dictionary page.

		VOICE-OVER
	Lacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing
	portion, especially in a manuscript.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is on the phone pacing.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	You can't tell her, Joel.  They explained
	that.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It
	might have a devastating effect.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives past vague local landmark.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Think about it: to be told you lived an
	existence of which you have no
	recollection.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	But what am I supposed to do?

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Move on, sweetie.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	How can I?  How can I move on when I know
	I'm the only one to carry this love we
	had?  How do I do that?

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in
movie closed for the season.  He weeps.  The windows fog up
until the outside is completely obscured.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel looks for an address.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Joel gets off on the sixth floor.  He searches for a room
number.  As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is
faded, vague and mostly erased.  He keeps walking, comes to
the door marked Lacuna and opens it.  Inside he can see
vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.

		MARY
		(dead monotone)
	Hi, May I help you?

These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself
and hear what's going on in his bedroom.

		STAN'S VOICE
	So, Mary's coming over tonight.

Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan works the joystick.  Patrick sits on the bed with Joel.

		PATRICK
	Yeah?

		STAN
	Just wanted to let you know.

		PATRICK
	I like Mary.  I like when she comes to
	visit.  I just don't think she likes me.

		STAN
	She likes you okay.

		PATRICK
	I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend
	over, too.  I have a girlfriend now.

		STAN
	You can if you want.

		PATRICK
	Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

		STAN
		(re: memory on monitor)
	This one's history.  Moving on...

		PATRICK
	The thing is ... my situation is a little
	weird.  My girlfriend situation.

		STAN
	Patrick, we need to focus.

Stan aims the joystick.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back
to the book.  The door opens.  He looks up.  Clementine is
staggering in, drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yo ho ho!

		JOEL
	It's three.

		VOICE-OVER
	Shit.  The last time I saw you.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.  I
	kinda sorta wrecked your car...

		JOEL
	I can't believe you wrecked my car.

		JOEL
	You're driving drunk.  It's pathetic.

		CLEMENTINE
	...a little.  I was a little tipsy.
	Don't call me pathetic.

		JOEL
	Well it is pathetic.  And fucking
	irresponsible.  You could've killed
	somebody.

The scene is starting to degrade.  The acting becomes anemic.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't know, maybe you did kill
	somebody.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.  It's
	just a fucking dent.  You're like some
	old lady or something.

		VOICE-OVER
	Right!  She called me an old lady here,
	too!  And I remember, I said...

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	And what are you like?  A wino?

		CLEMENTINE
	A wino?  Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
	A wino!
		(laughs)
	Face it, Joel.  You're freaked out
	because I was out late without you, and
	in your little wormy brain, you're trying
	to figure out, did she fuck someone
	tonight?

		JOEL
	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked
	someone tonight.  Isn't that how you get
	people to like you?

This shuts Clementine up.  She is stung and she starts
gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
apartment.  Joel is immediately sorry he said this.  He
follows her around.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I'm sorry.  Okay.  I didn't mean that.  I
	just... I was just... pissed, I guess.

Clementine is out the door.  Joel follows.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping
off in the distance.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Joel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down his
window to talk to her.

		JOEL
	Let me drive you home.

		CLEMENTINE
		(without turning)
	Fuck you, Joel.  Faggot.

		JOEL
	Look at it out here.  It's falling apart.
	I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy.

She keeps clomping.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	You did it to me.  I can't believe you
	did this to me.  By morning you'll be
	gone.  Ha!

He stops the car, gets out.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the
distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	See, remember that girl?  The one we did
	last week?  The one with the potatoes?

Joel looks up, startled.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan watches the screen.  Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at
the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK
	I gotta tell you something.  I kind of
	fell in love with her last night.

		STAN
	She was unconscious, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	She was beautiful.  So sweet and funky
	and voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair
	of her panties, is what.

		STAN
	Jesus, Patrick!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	I know.  It's not like... I mean, they
	were clean and all.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Look, just don't tell me this stuff.  I
	don't want to know this shit.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Yeah, okay.

		STAN'S VOICE
	We have work to do.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV.
It's hard to make out what they're watching.
They sit on opposite ends of the couch.  They look bored.
The scene quickly degenerates.  The room fades.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Okay, but there's more.

Joel listens.

		PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	After we did her, I went to where she
	worked and I asked her out.

Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch.
She stares straight ahead at the TV.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick... do you know how unethical...

		JOEL
	That must be the guy I saw you with.

		VOICE-OVER
	In the bookstore that night.  The skinny
	guy.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel watches TV.  Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks
at the TV.  She slips into a skirt.

		CLEMENTINE
	How can you watch this crap?

		JOEL
	Where are you going?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine puts on her shoes and
heads out the door.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily.  They barely look
at the animals.  Clementine watches parents with babies.

		JOEL
	Oh shit.  I remember this.
		(to Clementine)
	Want to go?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	I want to have a baby.

		JOEL
	Let's talk about it later.

		CLEMENTINE
	No.  I want to have a baby.  I have to
	have a baby.

		JOEL
	I don't think we're ready.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not ready.

		JOEL
	Clementine, do you really think you could
	take care of a kid?

She turns violently toward him, glaring.

		CLEMENTINE
	What?!

		JOEL
		(mumbly)
	I don't want to talk about this here.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!

Joel looks around.  People are watching.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You can't fucking say something like that
	and say you don't want to talk about it!

		JOEL
	Clem, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have --

		CLEMENTINE
		(screaming now)
	I'd make a fucking good mother!  I love
	children!  I'm creative and smart and I'd
	make a fucking good mother!

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine's rant continues but
becomes attenuated and vague.

		JOEL
	Oh, thank God.  It's going.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's you!  It's you who can't commit to
	anything!  You have no idea how lucky you
	are I'm interested in you!  I don't even
	know why I am!  I should just end it
	right here, Joel.  Leave you in the zoo.
	Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
	out with!

She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
emotion in it.  The scene is a husk.

		JOEL
	It's going, Clementine.  All the crap and
	hurt and disappointment.  It's all being
	wiped away.

She looks up at him.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm glad.

Their eyes lock.  She is fading before his eyes.

		JOEL
	Me, too.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

It's noisy and crowded.  Joel and Clementine sit at a small
table.  She is drunk and staring off, blankly.

		JOEL
	So, um --

		CLEMENTINE
		(swiveling head toward him)
	Would you get me another, Joely?

Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanky!  Thanky!

Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.

Joel is paying the bartender.  He turns with the drink to
head back to the table.  He sees Clementine flirting with a
man in Joel's seat.

Joel is at the table.  Clementine looks from her
conversation.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, this is Mark.  He likes my boobs.
	He came over special to tell me that.
	Isn't that nice.  He doesn't think I'm
	fat.

The scene starts to fade.  Mark rises.

		MARK
	I didn't know she was with someone, man.

		CLEMENTINE
	S'okay, Mark.  Joel doesn't like my
	boobs.
		(stage whisper)
	I don't think he likes girls.

The bar gets quiet and vague.

		JOEL
	You're drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're a whiz kid.  So perceptive, so --

Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible
words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.

A doorbell buzzes.  Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick opens the door.  Mary stands there in a winter coat,
carrying a backpack.

		MARY
		(coolly)
	Oh, hey, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	Hi, Mary.  How's it going?

She walks past him.

		STAN
	Hey, you.

Stan and Mary kiss.  She looks down at Joel as she takes off
her coat.

		MARY
	It's freezing out.

		STAN
	You found us okay?

		MARY
	Yeah.
		(re: Joel)
	Poor guy.
		(looking around)
	Have anything to drink?

		STAN
	We haven't checked.

		MARY
	Well, allow me to do the honors.  It's
	fucking freezing and I need something.

She heads into the kitchen.  Stan turns back to monitor the
slivers of light.

		PATRICK
	Mary hates me.  I've never been popular
	with the ladies.

		STAN
	Maybe if you stopped stealing their
	panties.

		PATRICK
		(guilty beat)
	Okay, There's more, Stan --

Stan looks over at Patrick.  Mary returns with a bottle of
scotch and two glasses.

		MARY
	Hey, hey.

She pours the whiskey.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did
	you?

		PATRICK
	Nah, I don't know.

Mary hands a glass to Stan.  She holds hers up in a toast.

		MARY
	Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
	the better even of their blunders.

Mary and Stan click glasses.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Nietzsche.  Beyond Good and Evil.  Found
	it my Bartletts.

		STAN
	That's a good one.

		MARY
	Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!  It
	seems really appropriate.

		STAN
		(a little sulky)
	It's a good one all right.

		PATRICK
	What's your bartlett's?

		STAN
	It's a quote book.

		MARY
	I love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill.
	He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's
	about Bartlett's.  Isn't that trippy?

		PATRICK
		(trying to engage)
	Yeah.  Cool.

		MARY
	"The quotations when engraved upon the
	memory give you good thoughts."

		PATRICK
	Very cool.  Trippy.

		MARY
	I like to read what smart people say.  So
	many beautiful, important things.

		STAN
	Yup.

		MARY
	Don't you think Howard's like that?
	Smart?  Important?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Yup.

		PATRICK
	Definitely!

		MARY
	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.

Stan focuses on the monitor.  Mary pours herself another
drink.

		PATRICK
	Definitely.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel and Clementine are in bed.  The memory is
already in the midst of being erased.  Clementine is talking
in a monotonous, robotic manner.

		CLEMENTINE
	You don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an
	open book.  I tell you everything.  Every
	damn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust
	me.

		JOEL
	No, it isn't that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to know you.

		JOEL
	I just don't have anything very
	interesting about my life.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, you're a liar.

The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there
for a moment, registering Clementine's statement.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence.  Joel looks around
at other couples in the restaurant.  Some seem happy and
engaged.  Others seem bored with each other.  He turns back
to his food.

		JOEL
	How's the chicken?

		VOICE-OVER
	Is that like us?  Are we just bored with
	each other?

		CLEMENTINE
	Good.

He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself
another glass.  She holds the wine bottle up to Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	More?

		JOEL
	No.  Thanks.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	How's the fish?

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	It's good.

They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? --
	Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I
	kind of have to study for my test --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed.  Stan watches the
lights on the computer screen.

		PATRICK
	Hold on.  Let me ask my friend.
		(covering mouthpiece)
	Stan, can I leave for a little while?  My
	girlfriend is very --

		STAN
	Patrick, we're in the middle of --

		PATRICK
	She's right in the neighborhood.  She's
	upset.

Mary is in the kitchen.  She pokes her head out.  She's got
some pie on a plate.

		MARY
	Let him go, Stan.  I can help.

		STAN
		(sighing, to Patrick)
	Go.

		PATRICK
		(quietly)
	Mary hates me.
		(into phone)
	I'll be right over, Tangerine.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Candles are lit.  Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on
the living room rug listening to music.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joely...

		JOEL
	Yeah, Tangerine?

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's my favorite book.  Since I was a
	kid.  It's about these toys.  There's
	this part where the skin Horse tells the
	rabbit what it means to be real.
		(crying)
	I can't believe I'm crying already.  He
	says, "It takes a long time.  That's why
	it doesn't often happen to people who
	break easily or have sharp edges, or who
	have to be carefully kept.  Generally by
	the time you are Real, most of your hair
	has been loved off, and your eyes drop
	out and you get loose in the joints and
	very shabby.  But these things don't
	matter at all, because once you are Real
	you can't be ugly, except to people who
	don't understand."

She's weeping.  Joel is stroking her hair.  They kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket.  It's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

		JOEL
		(screaming)
	No!  Jesus, No!

He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
She continues as if she's still being made love to, even
though Joel is completely beside himself.  He jumps up naked
and yells at the ceiling.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Please!  Please!  I've changed my mind!
		(looks down at fading
		 Clementine, then at ceiling)
	I don't want this.  Wake me up!  Stop the
	procedure!  Plea --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still.  Mary and
Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint.  After a silence:

		MARY
	It's amazing, isn't it?  Such a gift
	Howard gave the world.

		STAN
		(a sigh)
	Yeah.

		MARY
	To let people begin again.  It's
	beautiful.  You look at a baby and it's
	so fresh, so clean, so free.  And
	adults... they're like this messy tangle
	of anger and phobias and sadness...
	hopelessness.  And Howard just makes it
	go away.

		STAN
	You love him, don't you?

Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for
a long moment.

		MARY
	No.
		(beat)
	Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a
	very serious and ethical man.  I'm not
	going to tempt him to betray all he
	believes in.

Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges
through the snow.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's
crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings
open the door and hugs him.

		PATRICK
	Oh, baby, what's going on?

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I
	feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting
	old and nothing makes any sense to me.

		PATRICK
	Oh, Tangerine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes
	any sense.

She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Come up to Boston with me?

		PATRICK
	Sure.  We'll go next weekend and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to
	see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight!

		PATRICK
	Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit.

She runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and
realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's
thought, he *69's.  The phone rings.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message
	after the beep.

Beep.

		PATRICK
		(whisper)
	Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Hey, where are you?

		PATRICK
	I got into a situation with the old lady.
	Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm
	really sorry, man.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Stan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary,
stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft
and low on the stereo.

		STAN
	I can handle it.  He's pretty much on
	auto-pilot anyway.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		PATRICK
	Thanks, Stan.  I owe you.

Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He
pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then
pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the
bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what
he's looking for.  He reads:

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I took Joel to walk on Charles River with
	me last night.  It was so beautiful and
	charming.  Joel was nervous about
	stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to
	please me so much -- he's so sweet --
	that he came out after me.    We lay down
	right in the center and watched the
	stars.  He took my hand and said "I
	could...

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
river.  They look up at the stars.

		JOEL
	...die right now, Clem.  I'm just...
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love
and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased.
Joel is panicked.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Clem, no!  This can't keep happening.
	Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please!

Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her
sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about --

		JOEL
	You have to stop this!

		MIERZWIAK
	What?  What do you mean?

		JOEL
	I'm trapped in my head and everything I
	love is being erased!  Stop it now!

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, but... I'm just something you're
	imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your
	head, too.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick reads the journal.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	... and we made love right on the ice.
	It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It
	was wonderful.

Clementine enters, dressed for the cold.  Patrick puts the
notebook away.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm so excited.  Yay!

		PATRICK
	I'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to
	give you this.  It's a little... thing.

Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's gorgeous.
		(slipping it on)
	Just my taste.  I've never  gone out with
	a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I
	liked.
		(kisses him)
	Thanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.

		CLEMENTINE
	Such a beautiful view.

		JOEL
		(looking at her)
	Yes indeed.
		(snapping out of memory)
	Fuck!  They're erasing you, Clem!

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh?

		JOEL
	I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But
	I want it to stop, before I wake up and
	don't know you anymore.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wow.  Um, well... can't you just force
	yourself awake?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

He concentrates.  Nothing happens.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Aaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped!

He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
feet, screaming.  But even while he's doing this the memory
and Clementine are fading around him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's raining out.  Joel is reading, slouched in a chair.  He
looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her
underwear.  She's reading, too.

		VOICE-OVER
	She's so sexy.

		JOEL
	I loved you on this day.  I love this
	memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging.

Clementine looks over at him, smiles.  Her brow furrows in
thought.

		CLEMENTINE
	What if you hide me?

		JOEL
	What do you mean?

		CLEMENTINE
		(formulating)
	Well... if they're looking for me in
	memories I'm in, what if you take me to a
	memory I'm not in?
		(proud)
	And we can hide there till morning.

Joel ponders this.  The scene and Clementine are beginning to
dissolve.  Joel grabs Clementine's hand.  She giggles with
glee.  He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades.

		JOEL
	Where?  Where?  Where?

He drags her through the landscape of already decayed
memories and turns off into:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is dated and vague.  Joel and Clementine are in
an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  Joel wears
footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  He
holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  Clementine is
still in her panties and bra.  An oversized woman in high
heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth
preparing dinner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus.  What's this?

Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.

		JOEL
	I must be about two.
		(oddly)
	I want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not
	looking at me.
		(back to himself, re: doll)
	Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told
	you about this!
		(beat)
	I want my mommy!

He starts to cry.  Clementine tries to comfort him.  She hugs
him.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(crying still)
	I want my mommy.
		(adult, to Clementine)
	I don't want to lose you, Clem.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm right here.

		JOEL
	I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't
	want to lose you.  I don't want to
	lose...

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.
	The memory.  I think we're hidden.

Joel sucks in some snot.  His mother scurries back and forth
clanging pots.  The room is not decaying.  Joel smiles.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering
after sex.  Stan suddenly perks up.  He looks at the monitor.

		STAN
	It's stopped.

		MARY
	What?

		STAN
	Listen, it's not erasing.

He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It's not erasing.  He's off the screen.

		MARY
	Where?

		STAN
	I don't know.  He's not on the map.

Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  He fiddles
nervously with the equipment.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I don't know what to do!  I don't know
	what to do!  Crap.  Crap...

		MARY
	Well, what should we do?

		STAN
	I don't know!  I just said that!

		MARY
	Sor-ry
		(beat)
	We have to do something.  He can't wake
	up half done.

		STAN
	Shit!

He jerks the joystick spastically.  Mary, also naked, gets up
and looks over his shoulder at the screen.

		MARY
		(definitely)
	We should call Howard.

Stan turns and looks at her.  He's stoned and trying to
understand her motivation.

		STAN
	No way.  I can handle this.

		MARY
	This guy's only half cooked.  There's no
	time to fuck around, Stan.

Stan tries to think.  He paces.  Mary watches him.  Finally:

		STAN
		(without making eye contact)
	Okay.

He dials the phone, waits.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	Hello, Howard?

INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is dark.  A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone.
His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening.

		MIERZWIAK
	Stan?  What's going on?

		STAN'S VOICE
	The guy we're doing?  He's disappeared
	from the map.  I can't find him anywhere.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, what happened right before he
	disappeared?

		STAN'S VOICE
	I was away from the monitor for a second.
	I had it on automatic.  I had to go pee.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, where was Patrick?

		STAN'S VOICE
	He went home sick.

		MIERZWIAK
	Jesus.  All right, what's the address.

		STAN'S VOICE
	1062 Sherman Drive.  Apartment 1E,
	Rockville Center.

Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.  He hangs up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary.

		MARY
	He's coming?

		STAN
	You better go.

		MARY
	Hell no.

She starts getting dressed.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Shit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to
	see me stoned.  Stop being stoned, Mary!

She hurries into the bathroom with her bag.

		MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God, I look like shit!  God!

Mary slams the bathroom door.  Stan puts his head in his
hands.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel and Clementine are in the playpen.  Joel's oversized
mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the
head.

		MOTHER
	How's my baby boy?

She's gone.

		JOEL
	I really want her to pick me up.  It's
	weird how strong that desire is.

Clementine holds his hand.  He looks over at her.

		CLEMENTINE
	You know, we're okay.  They're not
	finding us.  You'll remember me in the
	morning.  And you'll come to me and tell
	me about us and we'll start over.

		JOEL
	I loved you so much this day.  On my bed
	in your panties.  I remember I thought,
	how impossibly lucky am I to have you on
	my bed in your panties.

She kisses him.

		CLEMENTINE
	You remember what happened next?

		JOEL
	I came over to the bed and you smelled so
	good, like you just woke up, slightly
	sweaty.  And I climbed on the bed with
	you and you said something like --

		CLEMENTINE
	-- another rainy day.  Whatever shall we
	do?

He laughs.  She unbuttons his pajamas.  They begin to make
love.  Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen.  Joel stops,
looks at Clementine.

		JOEL
	There's this guy!

		CLEMENTINE
	What?

		JOEL
	There's this guy.  I heard him talking in
	my apartment.  He's one of the eraser
	guys.  And he fell for you when they were
	erasing you, so he introduced himself the
	next day as if he were a stranger and now
	you're dating him.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Is he cute?

		JOEL
	He stole a pair of your panties while you
	were being erased!

		CLEMENTINE
	Gross! You must remember to tell me this
	in the morning.  I'm, like, so freaked
	out now.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S CAR - NIGHT

It's a rust bucket.  Clementine drives through the snow.
She's crying and holding Patrick's hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	What's wrong with me?

		PATRICK
	Nothing is wrong with you.  You're the
	most wonderful person I've ever met.

She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even
harder.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan works on trying to get the signal back.  His hair is
combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but
still stoned.  Mary is pacing nervously to and from the
window, looking out into the night.  She's dressed also, and
she's wearing more make-up now.  Her hair is pulled up into
some sort of style.  Suddenly she freezes at the window.

		MARY
	There he is.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Do
	I look okay?

She doesn't say anything.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	I'm still stoned.  Are you?  Crap.

She looks in the mirror.

		MARY (CONT'D)
		(to Joel)
	Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.

The doorbell buzzes.  Mary lunges for the door, then calms
herself before opening it.  Mierzwiak, holding an equipment
bag, looks surprised.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary.  What are you doing here?

		STAN
	She came to help, Howard.

		MARY
	I wanted to learn as much about the
	procedure as possible, Howard.  I think
	it's important for my job...to help
	comfort the clientele.  You know.

Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters.  Mary
closes the door.  Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.

		MIERZWIAK
	Let's get to the bottom of this.  Shall
	we?

He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Odd.

He fiddles some more.  Mary looks on, fascinated.

		STAN
	I tried that already.

		MIERZWIAK
	Did you try going through C-Gate?

		STAN
	Yeah.  Of course.

Mierzwiak ponders.  He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out
another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm going to do a Spectrum search
	throughout his memory, see if anything
	comes up.

Mierzwiak presses some more buttons.  The program starts up.
A much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this
screen.  It rotates.  Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small
distant light in the brain.  He zeroes in on it.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Okay, here it is.  I don't know why it's
	off the map like that, but --

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized
mother.  Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing.
The mother doesn't seem to see her.

		MOTHER
	Little baby getting awwwl cleean.  Awl
	clean.

		JOEL
		(to Clementine)
	I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's
	such a feeling of security.

		CLEMENTINE
		(giggling)
	I've never seen you happier.

The elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's
mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the
kitchen, Clementine.   Joel is thrown into:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in
movie theater.  The movie on the giant screen is partially
obscured by a fence.  Joel and Clementine drink wine.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, we're back in.

		MARY
	That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
	Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, thank you, Mary.

		STAN
		(sighing)
	You get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it
	from here.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yeah, probably a good idea.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what
the characters on the screen are saying.

		CLEMENTINE
	But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

		JOEL
	Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.

She starts to fade.  The scene starts to fade.  Joel
remembers their previous plan.

		JOEL
	They found us before.  The plan didn't
	work.  I don't know what to do now.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mouthing to woman on screen)
	Hide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere
	buried?

Joel grabs her.  They run off just as the scene decays into a
husk behind them.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan is back at the controls.  Mierzwiak's at the door with
Mary.

		STAN
	Howard, they've disappeared again.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh dear.

		MARY
	I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.

He nods, distractedly.  She smiles to herself as he heads
back to the equipment.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON

Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
building toward the bike rack.  Clementine is with him,
dressed as she was in the parked car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look at you, cutey!  What are we doing?

		JOEL
	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the
	shit out of me.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm terrified.  I thought if I hung
	around the art room long enough, he'd go
	home and I could get my bike.

They head toward the bike rack.  Joel's is the only bike
remaining.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Poor Joel.

They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.

		JOE EARLY
	Hi, Jill.

		JOEL
	He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill
	after this.

The other kids laughs.

		JOEL
	Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home.

		JOE EARLY
	I don't think so.  We're fighting.

		JOEL
	I don't want to fight you.

The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."  Joe Early
throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.  joel falls
and stays down, covering himself.

		JOE EARLY
	C'mon, Jill.  Get up, faggot.  C'mon.

Joel doesn't say anything.  He peeks humiliated at
Clementine.  She's watching him.  She's got a tear in her
eye.  She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.

		JOEL
	I'm too scared to even throw a punch.
	When I tell people this story I leave
	that part out.

The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mierzwiak is at the machine.

		MIERZWIAK
	We got him back.  Stan, I think I'm just
	going to have to get through this
	manually.  We're running late.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

It's cold.  Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up.  She
points at a house up the beach.

		CLEMENTINE
	Our house!  Our house!

She runs ahead, laughing.  The scene is decaying.  Joel
chases after her.

		JOEL
	Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
	Remember?

He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel, junior high school size, is in bed
masturbating.  Clementine is in there, too, in her winter
coat, still laughing from before.  She realizes what's going
on.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mock offended)
	Joel!

		JOEL
		(continuing to masturbate)
	I don't like it either, but I'm just
	trying to find horrible secret place to --

Joel's mother pops her head in the door.

		MOTHER
	Joel, I was just --
		(sees what's going on)
	Oh.  Um... I'll ask you in the morning,
	honey.  Have a good night.

The mother backs out, closes the door.  Joel cringes.
Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was
swiped from.  Flash!  It's all gone.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle
on a slice of cheesecake in front of her.  Joel hands her a
small wrapped box.

		JOEL
	Happy Birthday.

		CLEMENTINE
		(unwrapping the gift)
	Thanks, Joely.  A present!  Oh boy!

She pulls out the bracelet.  It's the same bracelet Patrick
gave her.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, Joel.  It's beautiful!
		(slip it on)
	I mean, you're the first guy who ever
	bought me a piece of jewelry I could
	honestly say that about.

He notices she's starting to fade.

		JOEL
	I scoured the city for it.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love it!

She leans across the table to kiss him.  He grabs her and
runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Joel is one of a group of five year olds.  He holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.  The other
boys are goading him.

		BOYS
	C'mon, Joel, you have to.  Do it already.

Joel doesn't want to.  Clementine watches.

		JOEL
	I can't.  I have to go home.  I'll do it
	later.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to do this.  But I had to
	or they would've called me a girl.

Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom.  The
kids hoot.

		VOICE-OVER
	I can't believe I did that.  I'm so
	ashamed.

A live bird watches from a tree.  Clementine, still dressed
for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
Joel away from the other boys.  The two of them walk down
Joel's suburban street.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay.  You were a little kid.
		(beat)
	This is a great birthday present.
	Getting to see you as a boy.

She kisses him and they walk holding hands.

		JOEL
		(pointing)
	That's where I live.  Lived.

Joel looks down at her hand.  It's fading.  The bracelet is
gone.  Clementine is gone.  His childhood house is gone.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak works the equipment.  He has located a small area
of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm getting the hang of it.  I still
	understand it.  But I'm finding him
	quickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't
	be too much peripheral eradication.

Mary sits on the bed.

		MARY
		(a little giggly)
	I like watching you work.

Stan sighs, grabs his coat.

		STAN
	I'll go out for a smoke.  If no one
	minds.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	That's fine, Stan.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Stan huffs and is out the door.
Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  Mary
gets up her courage to speak.

		MARY
	Do you like quotes, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	How do you mean?

		MARY
	Oh, um, like famous quotes.  I find
	reading them inspirational to me.  And in
	my reading I've come across some I
	thought you might like, too.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh.  Well, I'd love to hear some.

Mary is thrilled, beside herself.  She tries to calm down.

		MARY
	Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed
	are the forgetful, for they get the
	better even of their blunders."

		MIERZWIAK
	Is that Nietzsche?

		MARY
	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was
	thinking I could tell you something you
	didn't know.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we
	both know it.

He smiles at her.  She's flustered, flattered.

		MARY
		(sputtering)
	There's another one I like, I read.  It's
	by Pope Alexander.

		MIERZWIAK
	Alexander Pope?

		MARY
	Yes, shit.  Oops, sorry!
		(puts hand over mouth)
	Sorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't
	going to say Pope Alexander and sound
	like a dope and then I go ahead and do
	it.  Like I psyched myself out.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's no big deal.

		MARY
	You are such a sweetheart.

There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the
	blameless Vestal's lot!  The world
	forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal
	sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each
	prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

She smiles, proud and embarrassed.

		MIERZWIAK
	That's lovely.

		MARY
	Really?  I thought it was appropriate
	maybe.  That's all.
		(beat, then quickly)
	I really admire the work that you do.  I
	know it's not proper to be so familiar
	but I guess since we're outside the
	workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

		MIERZWIAK
	It's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it.

		MARY
	Okay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks.
		(blurting)
	I like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is
	that terrible?

Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his
unflappable self.

		MIERZWIAK
	You're a wonderful girl, Mary.

She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.

		MARY
	I've loved you for a very long time.  I'm
	sorry!  I shouldn't have said that.

		MIERZWIAK
	I've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know
	that.

		MARY
		(suddenly weepy)
	I wish I was your wife.  I wish I had
	your kids.

Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  It turns into kiss.  He
pulls away.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can't do this.

		MARY
	No you're right.  Once again.  You're a
	decent man, Howard.

He smiles sadly at her.  She smiles courageously at him.

		MIERZWIAK
	I want you to know it's not because I'm
	not interested.  If that means anything.

They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back
to locating and eradicating blips of lights.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an
unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches
Mierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It
appears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up
outside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out,
checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only
lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's
resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.
This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The
woman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to
unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
He practically shrieks and jumps up.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up
simultaneously.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary looks confusedly at Howard.

		MARY
	What?

She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who
turns and walks off in a huff.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh my God!

Mierzwiak is already in his coat.  He's out the door.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The woman is at her car.  Stan watches from the van.
Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.

		MIERZWIAK
	Hollis!  Hollis!

		HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
	I knew it, Howard.  I don't even know why
	I bothered to copy the damn address.

		MIERZWIAK
	It didn't start out to be this.  I came
	here to work.  It's a one-time mistake.

Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now.  Hollis is in her car.

		MARY
		(heroically)
	Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true.  And it's not
	Mr. Mierzwiak's fault.  I'm a stupid
	little girl with a stupid little crush.
	I basically forced him into it.  I swear.

Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.

		HOLLIS
	Don't be a monster, Howard.  Tell the
	girl.

Stan is out of the van now, listening.  Mary shivers in the
cold, hugs herself.  There's a long silence.  Then:

		MARY
	Tell me what?

Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes.  Mary looks back and
forth between them.  Hollis starts her car.

		HOLLIS
	Poor kid.  You can have him.  You did.

She drives off.  Mary watches Howard with increased
foreboding.

		MARY
	What, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	We... have a history.  I'm sorry.  You
	wanted the procedure.  You wanted it
	done... to get past.  I have to finish in
	there.  It's almost morning.  We'll talk
	later.

He shuffles inside.  Mary stands there, unable to digest
this, struggling in vain to remember.  Stan watches.

		STAN
	Let me take you home.

Mary shakes her head "no."  She walks off, dazed.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
and look up at the night sky.

		PATRICK
	I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Their eyes meet.  She sobs.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to go home.

She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
continues, now running.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT

Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car.  She tries
to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing
the job.  Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the
map of Joel's brain.  He targets it.

EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY

Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
oversized father.  Clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love this book, Joel.  Thank you so
	much for telling me about it.

Joel is his father.  The father is drunk and sullen.  He
faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.

		FATHER
	Don't be like me, son.  Don't waste your
	life.  You'll come to a point someday
	where it'll be too late.  You'll be sewn
	into your fate...

		JOEL
	It was horrifying, seeing my father like
	that.
	There was no hope for me if his life was
	such a failure.  And he saw failure in
	me, too, written in my future.

Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, you're not sewn in.  He's wrong.

		FATHER
	...and there'll be nowhere to go except
	where you're headed, like a train on a
	track.  Inevitable, unalterable.

The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across
from Clementine.  He is ragged and jarred.

		JOEL
	I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride
	it out.  Hiding is clearly not working.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.

		JOEL
	I want to enjoy my little time left with
	you.

		CLEMENTINE
	This is our first "date" date.

		JOEL
	Do you remember what we talked about?

		CLEMENTINE
	Naomi, I guess.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	What was I wearing?

		JOEL
	God, I should know.  Your hair was red.
	I remember it matched the wallpaper.

		CLEMENTINE
	Egad, were you horrified?

		JOEL
	No!  I think you were wearing that black
	dress, y'know, with the buttons.

She is wearing the black dress.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, you were with me when I bought that.
	At that place on East 6th.  It was later.

INT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP

The scene has already been erased.  It's just a decayed husk.
A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Clementine wears a generic black dress now.

		JOEL
	Right.  Something black though.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll buy that.  Black's always good.

		JOEL
	We did talk about Naomi.

		CLEMENTINE
	I said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure.

		JOEL
	I'm sure, I said.

		CLEMENTINE
	But you weren't.  I could tell.

		JOEL
	I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't
	think of anything to say.  There were
	long silences.

There is a long silence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd
	mistaken infatuation for love.  You said:

		CLEMENTINE
	So what.  Infatuation is good, too.

		JOEL
	And I didn't have an argument.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house.

		JOEL
	I dropped you off after.  You said --

		CLEMENTINE
		(Mae West)
	Come up and see me... now.

		JOEL
	It's very late.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, exactly.  Exactly my point.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex.

		JOEL
	This was our first time.

The scene starts to fade.  Joel watches Clementine disappear.

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

Mary enters the dark room, frazzled.  She flips on the
fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one
with her name on it.  Her jaw drops.  With a shaky hand, she
puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	Okay, so just tell me what you remember.
	And we'll take it from there.

		MARY'S VOICE
		(shaky)
	Um, I liked you immediately.  At the job
	interview.  You seemed so... important
	and mature.  And I loved that you were
	helping all these people.  You didn't
	come on to me at all.  I liked that.  I
	was tongue-tied around you at first.  I
	wanted you to think I was smart.  You
	were so nice.  I loved the way you
	smelled.  I couldn't wait to come to
	work.  I had these fantasies of us being
	married and having kids and just...
		(starts to cry)
	...and so... then... when...
	that one day, when I thought you looked
	at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't
	do this?  How can I do this?

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	It's what's best, Mary.  You know that.

Mary slumps to the floor.  We move into her eyes.

		MARY'S VOICE
	Yeah, I know.  Oh, God.  Okay, well, I
	was so excited...

A SERIES OF MURKY IMAGES.  NO DETAIL.

A flirtatious look from Mierzwiak.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	...Remember you bought me that little
	wind-up frog?

A vague shot of a wind-up frog.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	And you said...

A vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"This is for your desk.  Just a little
	token"

Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	I knew then... I knew something was going
	to happen... something wonderful.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits in the quiet living room.  The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Naomi.

		VOICE-OVER
	On the couch.  Dark.  Quiet.  I wondered
	if I had made a terrible mistake.  I
	almost reached for the phone about a
	thousand times.  I thought I could take
	it back, erase it, explain I had
	momentarily lost my mind. Then I told
	myself we weren't happy.  That was the
	truth.  That what we were was safe.
	It was unfair to you and to me to stay in
	a relationship for that reason.  I
	thought about Clementine and the spark
	when I was with her, but then I thought
	what you and I had was real and adult and
	therefore significant even if it wasn't
	much fun.   But I wanted fun.  I saw
	other people having fun and I wanted it.
	Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one
	is really having fun; I'm being suckered
	by advertising and movie bullshit... then
	I thought maybe not, maybe not.  And then
	I thought, as I always do at this point
	in my argument, about dying.

INT. ROOM - DAY

An elderly man sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I projected myself to the end of my life
	in some vague rendition of my old man
	self.  I imagined looking back with a
	tremendous hole of regret in my heart.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't pick up the phone to call you,
	Naomi.  I didn't pick up the phone.

The scene dissolves.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Namoi is red-eyed from crying.  She is packing things in
boxes.  Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what
to say.  She holds up a book.  The scene starts to fade.

		NAOMI
	Yours?

		JOEL
	You take it.  I don't know.

She tosses it in a box.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Naomi, I really value our relationship.
	I hope it's possible for us to stay in
	touch.

		NAOMI
	Don't do this to me now, Joel.  Really.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in
the trunk of a car.  There's another woman down there with
her.  They get into the car and drive off.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel talks to Clementine.  The scene is fogging over.

		JOEL
	I told her today I need to end it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Is that what you want?

		JOEL
	I did it.  I guess that means something.

Clementine shrugs.  The scene fades.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Joel walks with Naomi.

		NAOMI
	So what's going on, Joel?

		JOEL
	I don't know, I've just been thinking,
	maybe we're not happy with each other.

		NAOMI
	What?

		JOEL
	Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort
	of, unhappy with each other and --

		NAOMI
	Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

		JOEL
	I think maybe, we're both so used to
	operating at this level that -- How can
	one person be unhappy?  If one person is
	unhappy, both have to be... by
	definition.

		NAOMI
	Bullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone.

		JOEL
	No.  I just need some space, maybe.

		NAOMI
	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you
	think you have with this chick, once the
	thrill wears off, you're just going to be
	Joel with the same fucking problems.

		JOEL
	It's not somebody else.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hate myself.

Naomi walks off.  Joel watches her.  The scene fades.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel enters, looks around.  There's no sign of Clementine.
Joel approaches a male employee.

		JOEL
	Is there a Clementine who works here?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #1
		(calling to another male
		 employee)
	Mark, is Clem on tonight?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #2
	On my dick, bro.
		(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed)
	Oh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in
	Philosophy.

Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.

		JOEL
	Hi.

She turns.

		CLEMENTINE
	I didn't think you'd show your face
	around me again.  I figured you were
	humiliated.  You did run away, after all.

		JOEL
	Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm
	not a stalker.  But I needed to see you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(seemingly uninterested)
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	I'd like to... take you out or something.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you're married.

		JOEL
	Not yet.  Not married.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the
	bat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not
	going to tiptoe around your marriage or
	whatever it is you got going there.  If
	you want to be with me, you're with me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	So make your domestic decisions and maybe
	we'll talk again.

She goes back to stacking.  Joel stands there helplessly.

		JOEL
	I just think that you have some kind
	of... quality that seems really important
	to me.

The scene is disintegrating.  Clementine's speech is
delivered without passion.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to
	just keep that in your head.  Too many
	guys think I'm a concept or I complete
	them or I'm going to make them alive, but
	I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking
	for my own peace of mind.  Don't assign
	me yours.

		JOEL
	I remember that speech really well.

		CLEMENTINE
		(smiling)
	I had you pegged, didn't I?

		JOEL
	You had the whole human race pegged.

		CLEMENTINE
	Probably.

		JOEL
	I still thought you were going to save
	me.  Even after that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I know.

		JOEL
	It would be different, if we could just
	give it another go around.

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we
	can.

The scene is gone.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits forlornly in the back seat.  Rob drives and Carrie
sits in the front passenger seat.  The car stops in front of
Joel's apartment building.

		JOEL
	Thanks, guys.

		CARRIE
	I hope you feel better, sweetie.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CARRIE
	Say hi to Naomi.

The car door closes.

INT. BUILDING STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Joel climbs the stairs.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hope she's not up.  I need to think.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lights are off.  Joel sits on a chair near the window,
writing in his journal.  The streetlight illuminates the
paper.  Naomi sleeps in the bed.

		VOICE-OVER
	I met someone tonight at a party on the
	beach.  Her name is Clementine.  There is
	something alive about her.

Naomi turns over in bed, sees Joel.

		NAOMI
		(full of sleep)
	Hi.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		NAOMI
	How was it?

		JOEL
	You didn't miss much.  Rob Carrie say
	hello.

		NAOMI
	Hi, Rob and Carrie.

		JOEL
	Go back to sleep.

The room is starting to decompose.

		NAOMI
	Yeah.  Come to bed.  I'm cold.

		JOEL
	In a minute.

Naomi turns over.  Joel goes back to his writing.

		VOICE-OVER
		(more and more emotionless)
	I don't know what to do about this.  I've
	been feeling so alienated and numb
	lately.  Forever.  The thought of not
	acknowledging my feelings again seems
	self-destructive.
	How can I continue on this path toward a
	living death, a life filled with
	obligation and guilt and responsibility
	but joyless, hopeless?  I need to speak
	with Clementine.

The scene has turned to a husk.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater.  Naomi is at the
dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing.
Joel turns and watches her for a moment.

		JOEL
	So you don't mind?

		NAOMI
	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Okay.  I wish you could come.

		VOICE-OVER
	This is it.  The night we met.  My God,
	it's over.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Me, too.

He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head.  She
continues to write.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Say hi to Rob and Carrie.  Have some fun!

		JOEL
	I hope you get your work done.

		NAOMI
		(sighing)
	Yeah.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Rob drives.  Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front
passenger seat.  Joel sits in the back.

		CARRIE
	I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.  You
	okay?  You seem quiet.

		JOEL
	Just a little overworked, maybe.

		VOICE-OVER
	The trip to the party where I met
	Clementine.  My first memory of her is
	now my last memory of her.

Joel looks out the window.  Carrie turns around and says
something to Joel.  She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.

		JOEL
	I remember you turned around.  Your face
	was dark and your hair was backlit -- I
	could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me
	if things were okay between Naomi and me.

		CARRIE
	I did.  You said, things were fine.

		JOEL
	I remember.

		CARRIE
	This is the night you met Clementine,
	Joel.  I remember watching you walk down
	the beach with her and I thought, oh
	shit.

		JOEL
	Yeah, you told me that later.

		CARRIE
	I told you that later.

Joel looks out he window.  He sees the husk of a memory on
the darkened roadside.  It's Joel and Carrie in:

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Faded.  Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee.

		CARRIE
	Who was the girl you walked off with?

		JOEL
	No one.

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a
small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.

		CARRIE
	Is this the right way?

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
down the beach.  People and music can be heard.

EXT. BEACH - LATER

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

		JOEL
	You were down by the surf.  I could just
	make you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Your back to me.  In that orange
	sweatshirt I would come to know so well
	and even hate eventually.  At the time I
	thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

		VOICE-OVER
	I remember being drawn to you even then.
	I thought, I love this woman because
	she's alone down there looking out at the
	black ocean.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	But I went back to my food.  The next
	thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
	next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
	out of the corner of my eye.

A shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up.

		CLEMENTINE
	Hi there.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		VOICE-OVER
	I was so nervous.  What were you doing
	there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime
	green.  Green revolution.

A shot of her green hair.

		JOEL
	You said...

		CLEMENTINE
	I saw you sitting over here.  By
	yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone
	normal, who doesn't know how interact at
	these things either.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
	that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
	you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
	such a loser.  Every time I come to a
	party I tell myself I'm going to be
	different and it's always exactly the
	same and then I hate myself after for
	being such a clod.

		JOEL
	Even then I didn't believe you entirely.
	I thought how could you be talking to me
	if you couldn't talk to people?

		VOICE-OVER
	But I thought, I don't know, I thought it
	was cool that you were sensitive enough
	to know what I was feeling and that you
	were attracted to it.

		CLEMENTINE
	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
	ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of
	people do well at this stuff?

		VOICE-OVER
	And I just liked you so much.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You did?  You liked me?

		JOEL
	You know what I did.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing.

		JOEL
	You said --

She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of
	your chicken?

		JOEL
	And you picked it out of my plate before
	I could answer and it felt so intimate
	like we were already lovers.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I remember --

		VOICE-OVER
	The grease on your chin in the bonfire
	light.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh God, how horrid.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	No, it was lovely.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Hi, Joel.  So no jokes about my name?

		JOEL
	You mean, like...
		(singing)
	Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
	darlin', Clementine... ?  Huckleberry
	Hound?  That sort of thing?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, like that.

		JOEL
	Nope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when
	I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
	doll.  I think your name is magic.

She smiles.

		CLEMENTINE
		(eyes welling)
	This is it, Joel.  It's gonna be gone
	soon.

		JOEL
	I know.

		CLEMENTINE
	What do we do?

		JOEL
	Enjoy it.  Say good-bye.

She nods.

Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	So you're still on the Zoloft?

		VOICE-OVER
	Next thing I remember we were walking
	down near the surf.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I stopped.  I didn't want to feel
	like I was being artificially modulated.

		JOEL
	I know what you mean.  That's why I
	stopped.

		CLEMENTINE
	But my sleeping is really fucked up.

		JOEL
	I don't think I've slept in a year.

		CLEMENTINE
	You should try Xanax.  I mean, it's a
	chemical and all, but it works... and it
	works just having it around, knowing that
	it's there.  Like insurance.

		JOEL
	yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll give you a couple.  See what you
	think.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

		JOEL
	I love her.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Me, too!  I don't meet people
	who even know who she is and I work in a
	book store.

		JOEL
	I think she's great.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  There's this poem --

		JOEL
	Did this conversation come before or
	after we saw the house?

		CLEMENTINE
	I think, before.

		JOEL
	Seems too coincidental that way.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, maybe.

Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside
	gusts of wind,/And a house in which we
	don't live...

		JOEL
	Yeah, yeah.  It goes "Perhaps there is
	someone in this world to whom I could
	send all these lines"?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes!  I love that poem.  It breaks my
	heart.  I'm so excited you know it.
		(pointing to houses)
	Look, houses in which we don't live.

Joel chuckles appreciatively.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I wish we did.  You married?

		JOEL
	Um, no.

		CLEMENTINE
	Let's move into this neighborhood.

Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.  Joel
is nervous.

		JOEL
	I do sort of live with somebody though.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.

She walks to the next house, tries the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Male or female?

		JOEL
	Female.

		CLEMENTINE
	At least I haven't been barking up the
	wrong tree.

She finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Cool.

		JOEL
	What are you doing?

		CLEMENTINE
	It's freezing out here.

She scrambles in the window.  Joel looks around, panicked.

		JOEL
		(whisper)
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	I couldn't believe you did that.  I was
	paralyzed with fear.

The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's
	coming here tonight, believe me.  This
	place is closed up.  Electricity's off.

		JOEL
	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

		CLEMENTINE
	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

He walks cautiously toward the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had
	you.  You knew I knew that, right?

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door
behind him.

		JOEL
	I knew.

		CLEMENTINE
	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi
	wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
	criminally trespass.

		JOEL
	It's dark.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name?

		JOEL
	Naomi.

She's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out
a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles,
	matches, and the liquor cabinet.

		JOEL
	I think we should go.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, it's our house!  Just tonight --
		(looking at envelope on
		 counter)
	-- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which
	one do you want to be?  I prefer to be
	Ruth but I'm flexible.
		(opens cabinet)
	Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going
	find the bedroom and slip into something
	more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment.

She runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning
into a husk.

		JOEL
		(calling after her)
	I really should go.  I really need to
	catch my ride.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous.
	I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you
	were exciting.  You called from upstairs.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(flat)
	So go.

		JOEL
	I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt
	like I was a scared little kid.  I
	thought you knew that about me.  I ran
	back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
	humiliation.  You said, "so go" with such
	disdain.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(poking her head downstairs)
	What if you stay this time?

		JOEL
	I walked out the door.  There's no more
	memory.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come back and make up a good-bye at
	least.  Let's pretend we had one.

Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
way through the decaying environment.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Bye, Joel.

		JOEL
	I love you.

She smiles.  They kiss.  It fades.

		CLEMENTINE
	I --

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.  This scene,
too, is disintegrating.  It dries up and Joel is just
standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen
in the distance like a photograph.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front.

		CARRIE
	Did you have fun?

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.
He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all
has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Howard watches the monitor.  The last specks of light are
fading.  It grows dark.  He is tired, his eyes are hollow.
He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.

		HOWARD
	Okay.

Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up.  He pulls the
electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags.
Howard dials the bedside phone.  He waits as it rings.

		HOLLIS'S VOICE
	Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks.  We
	can't come to --

Howard hangs up.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back
of the van.  He and Howard look at each other.

		STAN
	So, I've got to drop the van off.

		MIERZWIAK
	Thanks, Stan.  Thanks.

INT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston.  Mary is
silent and depressed.  Patrick tries to break the silence.

		PATRICK
	You want to stop for coffee or something?

Mary shakes her head "no."  Long silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well, it was sure beautiful on that
	river.  Thanks for sharing it with me.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well do it again soon.

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNING

Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna."  He gets out,
crosses to his car.  Mary is sitting on the hood.

		STAN
	Hey.

		MARY
		(beat)
	Do you swear you didn't know?

		STAN
	I swear.

		MARY
	And you never even suspected?  Never saw
	us behaving in any unusual way together?

		STAN
	Once, maybe.

She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It was here.  At his car.  I was coming
	back from a job and spotted you together.
	You seemed caught.  I waved.  You
	giggled.

		MARY
	How did I look?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Happy.  Happy with a secret.

Mary starts to cry.

		MARY
	And after that?

		STAN
	I never saw you together like that again.
	So I figured I was imagining things.

Mary says nothing.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I really like you, Mary.  You know that.

		MARY
	Do you remember anything else?  What I
	was wearing?  Was I standing close to
	him?  Was I leaning against his car like
	I owned it?  How did he look at me when I
	giggled?  Tell me everything.

		STAN
		(thinking)
	You were in red.  That red sweater with
	the little flowers, I think.  You were
	leaning against his car.
		(thinking)
	He looked a little like a kid.  Kind of
	goofy and wide-eyed.  I'd never seen him
	look like that before.  Happy.  You
	looked beautiful.  You looked in love.

		MARY
		(heading toward the levator)
	Thanks, Stan.

She stops but doesn't turn to face him.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	You're nice.
		(beat)
	But I love him.  I knew I loved him.  Now
	I know.

He nods.  She waves, heads to the elevator.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Joel awakens.  The apartment is neat, like when he went to
sleep.  He gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

Joel waits on the crowded platform.  The platform across the
tracks is empty.  Joel's train arrives.  It's packed.  He
squeezes on with all the other commuters.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works in his cubicle over the light table.  He seems
distracted.  He dials his phone.  He's nervous.

		JOEL
	Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I
	know, I know.  It's been a long time.
	Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great!
	Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you
	dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free.
	Okay, good!

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary does paperwork at her desk.  She looks through her
reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with
their bags of stuff.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits.  He hangs up.  Mary
enters with the papers.

		MARY
	I need this signed, Howard.

He takes it, unable to make eye contact.  He signs it, hands
it back.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Thanks.
		(beat)
	So... do we talk about this... or what?

		MIERZWIAK
	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary.
	I want to do the right thing here.

		MARY
	Do you love me?  Did you love me?
	Something.  I listened to my tape.  I
	can't believe I've been sitting right in
	front of it for a year.  It's like
	listening to someone else's story.  I
	mean, I hear myself talking about having
	sex with you and I can't even imagine you
	naked.  I can't even say "naked" to you!

		MIERZWIAK
	I have a family, Mary.

		MARY
	You made me have an abortion.

		MIERZWIAK
	It was a mutual decision.

		MARY
	You made me have you erased!  I loved
	you.  I love you!  How could you --

		MIERZWIAK
	I didn't make you.  You thought it best.
		(off her stare)
	But, look, I take full responsibility.

She looks at him for a long while.  Then, out of frustration,
she screams.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel sits across from Naomi.

		NAOMI
		(oddly cautious)
	So... you haven't been involved with
	anyone in all this time?

		JOEL
	It's been a pretty lonely couple of
	years.

		NAOMI
	I'm sorry.

		JOEL
	Well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
	I'm sorry.

		NAOMI
	Oh, sweetie.  It really does cut both
	ways.  We were taking each other for
	granted and --

		JOEL
	I miss you.

		NAOMI
	Miss you, too.
		(awkward pause)
	I have been seeing someone for a little
	while.

		JOEL
		(trying for enthusiasm)
	Oh!  Great.  That's great!

		NAOMI
	A religion instructor at Columbia.  A
	good guy.  He's a good guy.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have --

		NAOMI
	I'm glad you called.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex.  There are certain
sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost
immediately.  She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way
that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to
him.  They finish and lie there.

		JOEL
	So you think the dissertation will get
	published?

		NAOMI
	I don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big
	public demand for books on Calvinism and
	Misogyny.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clementine lies in bed with Patrick.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.
The platform across the tracks from them is empty.  Suddenly,
Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He climbs
the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
empty platform.  An almost empty train pulls into that
platform.  Joel gets on the train and watches the business
commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
the station.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Mary gets out of bed.  She has been crying all night.  She's
a wreck.  She puts on some coffee then crosses into the
living room area.  Sitting there are piles of the files from
work.  She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address
onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  She
pulls another file out.  This one has Joel's name on it.  She
copies it onto an envelope.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel says goodbye to Clementine.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

Joel exits.  We stay on Clementine as she watches Joel head
to his car, tromping through the snow.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone.

		JOEL
	Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Hi.

		JOEL
	How's it going?

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Good.  I called you at work today.  They
	said you were home sick.

		JOEL
	I know.  I had to take the day to think.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Yeah, I tried you at home.  Did you get
	my message?

		JOEL
	I just got in.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Long day thinking.

Joel flips on messages with volume down.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I suppose so.

		NAOMI ON MACHINE
		(cheerful)
	Hi.  They told me you were sick!  So...
	Where are you?!  I had a really nice time
	last night.  Just wanted to say hi, so...
	hi.  Call me.  I'm home.  Call me!

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	That's me.

		JOEL
	There you are.
		(pause)
	Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall
	back into this fast without considering
	the problems we had...

		NAOMI
	Okay, Joel.  I suppose you're right.

		JOEL
	I had a good time last night.  I really
	did.

		NAOMI
	So I'm going to get some sleep.  I'm glad
	you're okay.

		JOEL
	We'll speak soon.

		NAOMI
	'Night.

She hangs up and Joel stands there for a minute feeling
creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	What took you so long?

		JOEL
	I just walked in.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hmmm.  Do you miss me?

		JOEL
	Oddly enough, I do.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Ha Ha!  You said, I do.  I guess that
	means we're married.

		JOEL
	I guess so.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine steps out onto it.  Joel follows nervously.

		CLEMENTINE
	Don't worry.  It's really solid this time
	of year.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	This is so beautiful.

She squeezes his hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	Isn't it?

She runs and slides on the ice.  Joel is by himself now.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  What if it breaks?

		CLEMENTINE
	What if?

Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars.  Joel
is paralyzed.  He looks back at the shore.

		JOEL
	I think I should go back.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, come here.  Please.

He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  She
reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand.
They look up at the stars.  She smiles, doesn't say anything
and snuggles closer to him.

		JOEL
	Listen, did you want to make love?

		CLEMENTINE
	Make love?

		JOEL
	Have sex.  Y'know --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, um...

		JOEL
	Because I just am not drunk enough or
	stoned enough to make that happen right
	now.

		CLEMENTINE
	That's okay.  I --

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that.
	This seems like the perfect romantic
	exotic place to do it and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Hey, Joel --

		JOEL
	-- and I'm just too nervous around you
	right now.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous, too.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you obviously don't know me.

		JOEL
	I'm nervous because I have and enormous
	crush on you.

She smiles up at the sky.

		CLEMENTINE
	Show me which constellations you know.

MONTAGE

We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
envelopes.  One by one they open the envelopes and pull out
tapes.  We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
people listen to their tapes.

EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel drops Clementine off.  She kisses him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel enters with his mail.  He opens a manila envelope, reads
the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo,
listens.  Joel dials the phone.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	Did you send this?  Is it a joke?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I probably got the same thing as you.

		JOEL
	I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've
	met you.  Who would even know to do this?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
		(matter of fact)
	Maybe it's true then.  It's my voice on
	the tape.

		JOEL
	That's what you have to say?  How could
	it be true?  I never even heard of any
	procedure like this.  It's a joke.

		CLEMENTINE
	Maybe.  Call someone who'd know.

MONTAGE

We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone.
We hear over and over:  "Is this true?", "Did this really
happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?"

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Carrie is on the phone.  She pauses nervously, then speaks:

		CARRIE
	Yes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't
	supposed to say anything.  They say it's
	like waking a sleepwalker.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Joel hangs up.  He dials the phone.

		JOEL
	It's true.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I know.  I spoke to my friend Magda.

Joel is immersed in the several page document.

		JOEL
	Look, I have to go.  I have to think.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Joel, we've fucked.  We've made love.
	Like a million times.  And we were so
	sweet and shy and inept with each other
	last night.  Isn't that lovely?

Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  He just
stands there dumbly.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	Come over here, sweetheart.  Please.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - LATER

Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages
together.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were closed off, non
	communicative, never told me what you
	were feeling.

		JOEL
	Says you were a bully...

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	A bully?  Moi?

		JOEL
	That's what it says.  You drank too much,
	you picked on me for being passive and
	timid.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, sounds like me.  Sorry, man.
		(reading)
	Says you were jealous and suspicious.

		JOEL
	Says you would sometimes disappear all
	night, then brag to me about your sexual
	conquests.

		CLEMENTINE
	Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or
	is that your way of putting it.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Doesn't sound like me.

		JOEL
	Says you were a slob, leaving trails of
	panties and dirty socks in your wake.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were constantly calling me a
	slob.
		(laughs)
	It's sexy that we were like a married
	couple, griping and overly-familiar and
	bored.  Don't you think?

		JOEL
		(considering)
	I sort of do.  But I only see it as a
	fantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up
	enough to be erotic.

		CLEMENTINE
	We should have sex.  It's old hat for us.

She smiles at nervous Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You know my body like the back of your
	hand.

She unbuttons her blouse.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Every curve, every freckle.

She takes off her shirt.  He stares at her.  He has clearly
never seen this body before.

		JOEL
	You're so beautiful.

She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her
waist for the first time.

INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding
their files, a stunned-looking lot.  There is a new woman in
the reception window.  The file cases behind her are bare.

		RECEPTIONIST
	May I help you?

		STAN
	I work here.  I used to work here.  Stan.
	Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean
	out my desk.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(into phone)
	Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes
	sir.
		(to Stan)
	He says he needs to see you.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Stan enters.  Mierzwiak is pale and pacing.

		MIERZWIAK
	She should not have done this, Stan.  As
	mad as she was... as justifiably --

		STAN
	I don't know what you're talking about,
	Howard.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary has stolen our files and is sending
	them back to people.

		STAN
	Jesus.

Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor
looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over
Stan's position.  He is in the process of interviewing a sad
young woman.

		YOUNG WOMAN
	... so I called everybody I know and
	asked them to tell me everything.  Now I
	know my entire history with him, but it's
	in the form of a story, I'm losing my
	mind.

		MIERZWIAK
	This is why people must never be told.
	It's like waking a --

		YOUNG WOMAN
	I don't know what to do.  Before I
	thought I was depressed for no reason.
	Now it's like I've been assigned a
	reason.

		PATRICK
	This never should've happened, ma'am.
	We'll take care of it.

		MIERZWIAK
	I know you don't like me much, Stan, but
	please talk to Mary.  She of all people
	should know this is a dangerous thing
	she's doing.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works over his light box.  His phone rings.

		JOEL
	Hi, it's Joel.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hey, lover.  Whatcha doing?

		JOEL
	I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I
	can till I can see you.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.

		JOEL
	You must have been crazy.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Guess what I'm wearing.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  Panties and --

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Your dried cum.

		JOEL
	Jesus.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're still excited by my irreverence.
	You haven't yet started to think of it as
	my "gratuitous need to shock."

		JOEL
	I can't stop thinking about you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay.  Meet me after work by the old mill.

		JOEL
	What old mill?  Is that somewhere we --

		CLEMENTINE
	I just wanted to say that.  Come by my
	house.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mary opens the door.  Stan stands there with two cups of take
out coffee.

		MARY
	Oh.

		STAN
	Hi.

		MARY
	What do you want, Stan?

		STAN
	Can I... I brought some --

She steps aside for Stan to enter.  He does, looks around,
sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	What's this?

		MARY
	Nothing.

		STAN
	I know what it is.

		MARY
	Then why did you ask me?

		STAN
	I don't know.  I just -- there are a lot
	of really confused people showing up at
	the office.

		MARY
	They have a right to know.  Howard is a
	thief.  He steals the truth.
		(suddenly weeping)
	I can't remember my baby!  I can't
	remember my baby.  It existed and I can't
	even remember.  Do you understand that?

Stan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary
slumps into a ball on a chair.

		STAN
	Mary, people come to him voluntarily.

		MARY
	I won't allow it.  Those who cannot
	remember the past are condemned to repeat
	it.  What do you think of that?  That's
	from my quote book.

		STAN
	The office is filled with people who want
	their memories re-erased.

		MARY
		(hysterically)
	Remember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo!

		STAN
	Mary... please.  This is hurting people.

Long pause, then:

		MARY
		(small)
	I don't want to hurt people.
		(breaking down)
	But these things happened!  All these
	little sadnesses, the big ones.  What if
	no one remembers?  What does that do to
	the world?
		(beat, quietly)
	Someone has to remember, Stan.

They look at each other.

EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	I was by myself in the park because my
	friend Davia was sick that day.  I was on
	a swing.  There was this smiling man
	walking a little bushy dog --

Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	The man said something like, "He's
	friendly --"

Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the
woman's.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"-- he won't bite."

		MAN
	He won't bite.  You can pet him if you
	want...

Shot of the girl petting the dog.

		MAN
	Do you want to give him a biscuit?

The girl nods.

		MAN (CONT'D)
	They're in my car.  Why don't you --

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE
	Excuse me?  Hello?

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary, with a headset on, looks up, startled.  She switches
off the tape.  She has been crying.  There's a pile of tapes
next to her.  The distraught woman is standing there.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
	I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak.  My name is
	Helene Kernfeld.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  The doctor will
	be with you momentarily.

The woman sits.  Mary presses an intercom button.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Howard, your 10:30.

She switches the tape back on.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	He took me to his car and ...

Vague shot of the girl being raped.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in
her lap, as she travels over the New York skyline.  We move
into her eyes.

INT. VAGUE SPACE

Vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined
space:

The young girl being raped by the man in the car.

A soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered
friends.

A couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.

		MAN
	I...I... I... find you physically
	repulsive!  I can't even look at you!

They look at each other in silence.

A little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession
of boys.

The aftermath of a car accident from the driver's POV.

Mary having an abortion.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman and her chair lift out of the line of
commuters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

It's modern and well-appointed.  The old woman enters, sits
behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the
drawer.   She takes some pills with water.  An old man
enters.

		OLD MAN
	How are you today, Mary?

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Let's see... Still dying, Howard.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	You don't have to jump down my throat.  I
	was trying to be nice.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Well, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.

Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back.
Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,
places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and
listens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  We watch the
color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.
Another old woman enters the office.  Old Mary looks up,
seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)
	May I help you?

		SECOND OLD WOMAN
	I'd like to make an appointment.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	I think the doctor is free this morning.
	He can probably take you right away for
	an initial consultation.

The second old woman smiles gratefully.

INT. OLD MAN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Old Howard works at his desk.  Old Mary enters with the
second old woman.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine
	Kruczynski.  She'd like to talk to you.

Old Howard and the old Mary eye each other.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	Hello, Ms. Kruczynski.  Nice to meet you.
	Please have a seat.

He indicates a sitting area.  She sits.  He joins her.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	Would you mind if I tape our discussion?

She shakes her hear.  He punches a couple of buttons on his
computer console.  A tape recorder starts up and his computer
screen lights up so only he can see it.  On it we see a whole
file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of
previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them
involving Joel Barish.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	So, why don't you begin by telling me why
	you've come here.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)
	Well, I met this man, Joel, three years
	ago at a senior dance...  We'd both been
	alone for so long and...

INT. TUBE - NIGHT

The old woman (Mary) travels in the commuter tube over
Manhattan.  It's late, the tube is mostly empty.  She has
earphones on.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	I remember Joel and I were having
	breakfast --

INT. VAGUE SPACE

An old man and the second old woman eat breakfast.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- I said something like we should go
	upstate and see the leaves change...

The old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly.  The
woman smiles, but there is no response... just a dead stare.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
		(CONT'D)
	He just stared at me as if I didn't
	exist.  As if I had never existed...

INT. TUBE - CONTINUOUS

The second old woman's (Clementine) voice drones tinnily on
in the distance.  The old woman with the earphones is dead,
her eyes glassy and unseeing.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- his eyes used to be so filled with
	love.  But it was gone.  How can I go
	back to being alone after seeing love?  I
	was alone for so long.  What had I done
	with my life?  I was alone so long.

INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to
modern versions of the erasing machines.  Two young
technicians monitor the equipment.  The woman's bedside phone
rings.  Her machine picks up.  After a moment:

		OLD MAN'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  What's going on, Clem?
	Why won't you call me back?  Please call
	me.  We need to speak.

The machine clicks off.  One of the technicians reaches over
and presses the "erase" button on the machine.

BLACK.

THE END
INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

It's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She
seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist,
dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Oh, hi.

		OLD WOMAN
		(apologetically)
	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
	I'd see --

		RECEPTIONIST
	I think he's in a conference.
	Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry.

		OLD WOMAN
	Would you just try him?  You never know.
	As long as I'm here.  You never know.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Of course.  Please have a seat.

The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
lap.  She stares politely straight ahead.

		RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
		(quietly into headset)
	It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just
	-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's
	old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
		(to old woman)
	I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
	It's a crazy time of year for us.

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
corner.  Its ornaments are holograms.

		OLD WOMAN
	This book -- It's essential that people
	read it because --
		(gravely, patting the
		 manuscript)
	-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Maybe after the holidays then.

INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY

The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When
she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a
slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She
sits in the chair; it rises.

INT. TUBE -DAY

The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other
chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over New York City in the tube.
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
It's called:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits
follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER

Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25,
can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are
shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and
Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's
decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		CLEMENTINE
		(approaching reception area)
	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
	Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right
	with you.

Clementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks
up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.

INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Mary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door.

		MIERZWIAK (O.S.)
	Yes?

Mary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,
professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

		MARY
	Howard, your one o'clock.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.

She smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally
clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to
leave.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
		(looking up)
	Mary...

		MARY
		(turning back)
	Yes?

		MIERZWIAK
	Order me a pastrami for after?

		MARY
	Cole slaw, ice tea?

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding)
	Thanks.

		MARY
	Welcome, Howard.

She smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall,
spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

		STAN
	Boo.

		MARY
	Hi.

She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.

		STAN
	Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

He leans in to kiss her.  She cranes her neck to keep him
off.

		MARY
		(reprimanding whisper)
	Stan... c'mon...

		STAN
	Sorry.  I just --

		MARY
		(somewhat guiltilly)
	It's just...y'know... I mean...

		STAN
	I know.  Anyway --

		MARY
	Anyway, I've got to do my tap
	dance here.

She indicates the door to the reception area.  Stan nods.

		STAN
	See you later, alligator.

		MARY
	'kay.

		STAN
	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for
	Mierzwiak, would you --

		MARY
	I better do this, Stan.

Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Ms. Kruczynski?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	Hi.

After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary
leads her down the hall, not looking back.

		MARY
		(professionally courteous)
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.

Clementine enters the office.  Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
closes the door, leaving them alone.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwiak
sits across from her.  He smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Well, why don't you tell me what's going
	on?  Do you mind if I turn this on?

He indicates a tape recorder.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't care.

He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Well, I've been having a bad time of it
	with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
	You guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you
	guess you're having a bad time with hm?

		CLEMENTINE
	What?  No.  I don't like the term
	boyfriend.  It's so gay.

Mierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
throughout.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Maybe gay isn't the right word.  But,
	anyway, it's been rough with him...
	whatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My
	significant other... heh heh.  And I
	guess on a certain level, I want to break
	it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
	this constant questioning and re
	questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give
	it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do
	I expect?  Relationships require work.
	You know the drill.  The thing that I
	keep coming back to is, I'm not getting
	any younger, I want to have a baby... at
	some point... maybe... right?  So then I
	think I should settle -- which is not
	necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
	a good guy.  It's not really settling.
	Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of
	movies, y'know?  That I have some
	completely unrealistic notion of what a
	relationship can be.  But then I think,
	no, this is what I really want, so I
	should allow myself the freedom to go out
	and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?
	But then I think he is a good guy and...
	It's complicated.  Y'know?

		MIERZWIAK
	I think I know. I think we can help.  Why
	don't you start by telling me about your
	relationship.  Everything you can think
	of.  Everything about him.  Everything
	about you.  And we'll take it from there.

She nods, thinks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION

SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.  He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.  The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.  Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.  Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER

Joel talks on a phone.  The wind howls around him.  He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.

		JOEL
	Hi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not
	feeling well this morning.  No.  Food
	poisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so
	long to call in, but I've been vomiting.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He
passes an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each
other.

Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.

Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

		JOEL
	January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work
	and took the train out to Montauk.
		(thinks)
	It's cold.
		(thinks some more)
	The sky is gray.
		(thinks some more)
	I don't know what else to say.  Nothing
	happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi
	last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to
	fall into our old familiar sex life so
	easily.  Like no time has passed.  After
	two years apart suddenly we're talking
	about getting together again.  I guess
	that's good.

He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She
stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes.

		JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	If I'm constitutionally incapable of
	making eye-contact with a woman I don't
	know.  I guess I'd better get back to
	Naomi.

Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window.

Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.

INT. DINER - DAY

It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel
glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth
and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.

		WAITRESS
	Coffee?

		CLEMENTINE
	God, yes.  You've saved my life!

The waitress pours the coffee.

		WAITRESS
	You know what you want yet?

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	Ain't that the question of the century.

The waitress is not amused.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

		WAITRESS
	Yeah.  We're having a run on it.

The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling)
	And some cream, please.

Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's
before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances
up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the
title.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.

INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching
him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling over the rumble)
	Hi!

Joel looks over.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.

		CLEMENTINE
	Why?

		JOEL
	Why what?

		CLEMENTINE
	Why are you sorry?  I just said hi.

		JOEL
	No, I didn't know if you were talking to
	me, so...

She looks around the empty car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?

		JOEL
		(embarrassed)
	Well, I didn't want to assume.

		CLEMENTINE
	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the
	leap and assume someone is talking to you
	in an otherwise empty car.

		JOEL
	Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi.

Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't
	have to scream.  Not that I don't need to
	scream sometimes, believe me.
		(pause)
	But I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to write or something.

		JOEL
	No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really
	think of much to say probably.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.  So...

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.

		JOEL
	I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
	here.  I didn't mean to --

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to --

		JOEL
	It's okay, really.

		CLEMENTINE
	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
	I have a long trip ahead of me.
		(sits across aisle from Joel)
	How far are you going?  On the train, I
	mean, of course.

		JOEL
	Rockville Center.

		CLEMENTINE
	Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds?

		JOEL
	The weirder part is I think actually I
	recognize you.  I thought that earlier in
	the diner.  That's why I was looking at
	you.  You work at Borders, right?

		CLEMENTINE
	Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God.
	Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's
	me: book slave there for, like, five
	years now.

		JOEL
	Really?  Because --

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit
	right now.

		JOEL
	-- because I go there all the time.  I
	don't think I ever saw you before.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as
	much as is humanly possible.  You have a
	cell phone?  I need to quit right this
	minute.  I'll call in dead.

		JOEL
	I don't have one.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy
	before me.

		JOEL
	I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an
	impression on me, that's why I was pretty
	sure I recognized you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah, the hair.
		(pulls a strand in front of her
		 eyes, studies it)
	Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The
	color.  Snappy name, huh?

		JOEL
	I like it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
	wondering.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in --

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?

		JOEL
	I can't remember.

		CLEMENTINE
	Anyway, this company makes a whole line
	of colors with equally snappy names.  Red
	Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
	That'd be a job, coming up with those
	names.  How do you get a job like that?
	That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.

		JOEL
	I don't really know how --

		CLEMENTINE
	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

		JOEL
	You think that could possibly be a full
	time job?  How many hair colors could
	there be?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Someone's got that job.
		(excited)
	Agent Orange!  I came up with that one.
	Anyway, there are endless color
	possibilities and I'd be great at it.

		JOEL
	I'm sure you would.

		CLEMENTINE
	My writing career!  Your hair written by
	Clementine Kruczynski.
		(thought)
	The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

		JOEL
	You sure?  That doesn't sound --

		CLEMENTINE
	I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their
	colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too
	old for this.  But it keeps me from
	having to develop an actual personality.
	I apply my personality in a paste.  You?

		JOEL
	Oh, I doubt that's the case.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
	know, do you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I got it.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	My name's Clementine, by the way.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't
	do that; you're trying to be nice.

		JOEL
	I don't know any jokes about your name.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound?

		JOEL
	I don't know what that means.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?

		JOEL
	I'm nut nuts.

		CLEMENTINE
		(singing)
	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
	darlin' Clementine?  No?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It
	means "merciful", right?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a
	vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

		JOEL
	See, I wouldn't think that about you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Why wouldn't you think that about me?

		JOEL
	Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't
	know.  I was... You seemed nice, so --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other
	adjectives?  There's careless and snotty
	and overbearing and argumentative...
	mumpish.

		JOEL
	Well, anyway... Sorry.

They sit in silence for a while.

		CLEMENTINE
	I just don't think "nice" is a
	particularly interesting thing to be.

The conductor enters the car.

		CONDUCTOR
	Tickets.

Joel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches
it and hands it back.

		CLEMENTINE
	What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an
	adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,
	sort of.

The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is
	pandering.  Cowardly.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	And life is more interesting than that.
	Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is...
	someday.
		(to conductor)
	I know it's here.

The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I don't need nice.  I don't need myself
	to be it and I don't need anyone else to
	be it at me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Damn it.  DAMN IT!
		(there it is)
	Oh.  Here.

She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He
punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

		CONDUCTOR
	Next stop Southampton.

The conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky.
She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while.
The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody
gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel?  It's Joel, right?

		JOEL
	Yes?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it
	yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever,
	I'm a little out of sorts today.

		JOEL
	That's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
		(stares out window)
	My embarrassing admission is I really
	like that you're nice.  Right now,
	anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to
	the next what I'm going to like.  But
	right now I'm glad you said, "that's
	okay" to me.  That was nice of you.

		JOEL
	It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some
	stuff I need to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just...
		(stands, throws bag over
		 shoulder)
	Take care, then.

		JOEL
		(pulling journal from
		 briefcase)
	Probably see you at the book store.

		CLEMENTINE
		(heading toward other end of
		 car)
	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.

Clementine sits and stares out the window.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has
inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His
head is immersed in his journal.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out
the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads
to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented
scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in.

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold.
He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

		JOEL
	Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, that's okay.  Thanks, though.

		JOEL
	You're sure?  It's cold.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't want to take you out of your way.

		JOEL
	It's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?

He pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive.

		JOEL
	Where do you live?

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not a stalker or anything, right?

		JOEL
	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were,
	but no.

		CLEMENTINE
	You can't be too careful.  I've been
	stalked.  I've been told I'm highly
	stalkable.  I don't need that.

		JOEL
	I'm not a stalker.

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	You know Wilmont?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wilmont.  Near the high school.

Joel turns.  They drive in silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
	nutso.  I'm not really.

		JOEL
	It's okay.  I didn't think you were.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you like bookstores, huh?

		JOEL
	I like to read.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I can't remember that album very
	well.  I remember liking it.  But --

		CLEMENTINE
	The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent
	most of the train ride trying to
	remember.  "Till you're full of rag water
	and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill
	out/Over the side to anyone who'll
	listen."  Remember?

		JOEL
	Sort of, um...

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember?  "And you take on the dreams of
	the ones who have slept there/And I'm
	lost in the window/I hide on the
	stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in
	your hat..."
		(starts to cry)
	Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.

		JOEL
	What?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm just a bit of a wreck.  "I sleep in
	your hat" makes me cry.
		(pointing to a house)
	Me.

Joel pulls over.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanks very much.  That was very nice of
	you.

		JOEL
	Well, I wouldn't want to be --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already
	told you that.
		(pause)
	Anyway.  See Ya.

Clementine opens the car door.

		JOEL
	Take care.

		CLEMENTINE
		(turning back)
	Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have
	lots of drinks.  And I could --

		JOEL
	Um --

		CLEMENTINE
	Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm
	embarrassed.  Good night, Joel.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries
to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at
the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We
see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing
drinks and chatting.

		CLEMENTINE
	Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about
	four years.  It's really cheap.  My
	downstairs neighbor is old so she's
	quiet, which is great.  And the
	landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
	great, and I have a little porch in the
	back, which is great, because I can read
	there, and listen to my crickets and...

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Two blue ruins...

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You like that?

		JOEL
	Very much.

		CLEMENTINE
	This... someone gave that to me, just
	like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like
	crows.  I think I used to be a crow.

She caws and hands Joel a drink.

		JOEL
	Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound.

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you believe in that stuff?
	Reincarnation?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription
	on the back.
		(takes it off the wall, reads:)
	The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust
	of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my
	heart/A change of mood/And saved some
	part/Of a day I rued.

		JOEL
	Frost?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
	lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems
	strictly grade school to me.  But this
	made me cry for some reason.  Maybe
	because it is grade school.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	It's pretty.

		CLEMENTINE
	I miss grade school.  I don't know why
	I'm calling it grade school all of a
	sudden.  When I went we called it
	elementary school.  But I like grade
	school better.  Sounds like something
	someone from the forties would call it.
	I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore
	hats.  Anyway, cheers!

		JOEL
	Cheers.

They click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and
pulls her boots off.

		CLEMENTINE
	God, that feels so fucking good.  Take
	yours off.

		JOEL
	I'm fine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.

Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes
her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Ready for another?

		JOEL
	No, I'm okay for now.

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

		JOEL
	What do you want to hear?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	You pick it.

		JOEL
	You just say.  I'm not really --

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	I don't know!  I can't see them from
	here, Joel!  Just pick something good.

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick
	good.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.

		JOEL
	Well, I should probably get going.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, stay.  Just for a little while.
		(opens her eyes, brightly)
	Refill?

		JOEL
	No.  I --

		CLEMENTINE
	I know a man who needs a refill.

She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
kitchen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where
	would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,
	and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think
	about that.

She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's
drink and a refill for herself.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Drink up, young man.  It'll make the
	whole seduction part less repugnant.

Joel looks a little alarmed.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'm just kidding.  C'mon.

She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches
her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles
drunkenly at him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

		JOEL
	Yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
	telling me I'm psychic.  She should know.
	Do you believe in that stuff?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  But sometimes I have
	premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe
	that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,
	you think something and then it happens,
	or you think a word and then someone says
	it?  Y'know?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my
	feeling about it.  It's hard to know.
	Like, okay, but how many times do I think
	something and it doesn't happen?  That's
	what you're saying, right?  You forget
	about those times.  Right?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I guess.

		CLEMENTINE
		(dreamy beat)
	But I think I am.  I like to think I am.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It's helpful to think there's some order
	to things.  You're kind of closed
	mouthed, aren't you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting.
	I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know
	what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.
		(considers this)
	Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm
	always anxious thinking I'm not living my
	life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking
	advantage of every possibility?  Just
	making sure that I'm not wasting one
	second of the little time I have.

		JOEL
	I think about that.

She looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled
	at you before about it.  God, I'm an
	idiot.

		JOEL
	I do have a tendency to use that word too
	much.

		CLEMENTINE
	I like you.  That's the thing about my
	psychic thing.  I think that's my
	greatest psychic power, that I get a
	sense about people.  My problem is I
	never trust it.  But I get it.  And with
	you I get that you're a really good guy.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I
	can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going
	on in your brain.  I can tell.  My
	goal... can I tell you my goal?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
		(ala Paul Simon)
	What's the goal, Joel?
		(laughs)
	My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
	through me?  Do you know what I mean?
	It's like, there's all these emotions and
	ideas and they come quick and they change
	and they leave and they come back in a
	different form and I think we're all
	taught we should be consistent.  Y'know?
	You love someone -- that's it.  Forever.
	You choose to do something with your life
	-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a
	sign of maturity to stick with that and
	see things through.  And my feeling is
	that's how you die, because you stop
	listening to what is true, and what is
	true is constantly changing.  You know?

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't
	need any more reason to do it.  Who knows
	what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're very nice.  God, I have to stop
	saying that.  You're nervous around me,
	huh?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous.  You don't need to be
	nervous around me, though.  I like you.
	Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

		JOEL
	No, not at all.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm
	through with that.  Y'know, if I don't
	love my body, then I'm just lost.  You
	know?

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	With all the wrinkles and scars and the
	general falling apart that's coming
	'round the bend.
		(beat)
	So, I've been seeing this guy...

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(off his reaction)
	Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's
	kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but
	he's really stuck on me, which is
	flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And
	he's, like, a dope, but he says these
	smart and moving things sometimes, out of
	nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's
	the one who gave me that crow photograph.

		JOEL
	Oh, yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went
	up to Boston, because I had this urge to
	lie on my back on the Charles River.  It
	gets frozen this time of year.

		JOEL
	That's scary sounding.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  I used to do it in college and
	I had this urge to go do it again, so I
	got Patrick and we drove all night to get
	there and he was sweet and said nice
	things to me, but I was really
	disappointment to be there with him.
	Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff
	comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with
	him.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	I think so.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't believe in that soulmate crap
	anymore, but... he says so many great
	things.  We like the same writers.  This
	writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
	And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,
	you should come up to the Charles with me
	sometime.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Oh, great!

She sits closer to him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --
	night picnics are different -- and --

		JOEL
		(shy)
	Sounds good.  But right now I should go.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pause)
	You should stay.

		JOEL
	I have to get up early in the morning
	tomorrow, so...

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	Okay.

Joel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone
table, pulls out a notepad.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I would like you to call me.  Would you
	do that?  I would like that.

		JOEL
	Yes.

She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it
in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
then forces himself to speak.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't think your personality comes out
	of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a
	pretty topping.

She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's
surprised and pleased and nervous.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(shyly formal)
	So, I enjoyed meeting you.

		CLEMENTINE
	You'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines and all.

		JOEL
	Okay.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through
the snow and getting in his car.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems
different, somehow foggy and disoriented.

SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER

He arrives at his apartment building and parks.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
street.  There are two dark figures inside.

		VOICE-OVER
	Them.

He hurries inside the building.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight.

		JOEL
	It was snowing.

		VOICE-OVER
	There are two of them.  Couldn't make
	them out.  The orange glow of a
	cigarette.

Joel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk.
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.

		JOEL
	The driver waved.  So casual, friendly.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm like a joke to them.

Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

		VOICE-OVER
	I guess they figure they can act like
	they want.  They don't have to worry
	about me remembering.

He paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts
to change, almost as if it is drying out.

		JOEL
	I might be making a mistake.

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just
	need to learn to live with this.  First
	of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it
	happened.  Those who do not remember
	history are condemned to repeat it.  Who
	said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.
	But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I
	have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.

		JOEL
	Fuck you, Clementine.

The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem
aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it.
It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Pink.
		(beat)
	There was a number on it.  I remember.
	AL 1718?
		(beat)
	I have to follow through with this.  I
	have no choice.

		VOICE-OVER
	The pill was pink, I remember.  It had
	some letters and numbers on it.  What
	were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four
	digits.  I don't like taking pills when I
	don't know what they are.  I have no
	choice.

He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	We're sorry, the number you have
	dialed...
		(beat)
	Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...

		RECORDED VOICE
	We're sorry, the number you have dialed
	is no longer in service.  If you think
	you have reached this recording in error
	-

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Bye.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the
scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment
building door open.  He hears footsteps.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	It's them.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's too late.

His eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes.

BLACK.

He hears a key in his apartment door.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Fuck.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring
transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind.
He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange
now.

		JOEL
	I should maybe talk to you.

		VOICE-OVER
	Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to
	her.

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.

		JOEL
	I love you and if you knew that... if I
	told you what happened...  I'll explain
	everything, what we meant to each other.
	I'll tell you everything about our time
	together.  You'll know everything again
	and...

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I
	wouldn't have to go through this and I
	could tell you everything and it would be
	like you knew and we could rebuild and we
	could be happy again and...

Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man
approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man
seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps
Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it
is and her face lights up.

		JOEL
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
ribs.

		PATRICK
	I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the
	neighborhood.

		CLEMENTINE
	You were not.

		PATRICK
	I was not.

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there,
the scene starts to dry out.
Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's
turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come over after I'm done here?

		PATRICK
	I can't.  I want to, but I have to study.

		CLEMENTINE
	You rat.

		PATRICK
	I really want to, but tonight's
	important.  Test tomorrow.

		JOEL
	How could she have done this to me?  How
	could anyone do this to anyone?

		CLEMENTINE
		(to Patrick)
	You didn't say anything about my hair.

		PATRICK
	It's so cool.  You're by far the most
	sensational person in the room.

		CLEMENTINE
	In the room?

		PATRICK
	In the world.

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

		JOEL
	What's happening here?
		(looks at watch; it's 9:30)
	Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be
	there soon.

Joel turns to leave.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's
weeping as he drives.

		JOEL
	Gotta get home.  How could she do this to
	me?
	How could she not care about what we
	meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What
	a fucking monster she is!

		VOICE-OVER
	Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe
	she's with that guy now!  I'm never going
	to see her again.  I love her so much.
	What a fucking monster she is!

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked
van.  We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.

		JOEL
	Them.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
He's been crying.  He looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street.  He turns back to the New York Street and
spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel sits in the small room with his bags.  A woman across
from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  Her
eyes are red from crying.  Mary, the receptionist, pokes her
head through her window into the waiting room.

		MARY
	Hello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've
	got your stuff.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel walks with his bags behind Mary.

		MARY
		(not looking back)
	How are you today?
		(at lab)
	Here we are.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

Joel enters.  Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab
coat.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be
	in charge of your procedure tonight.

Stan nods professionally.

		STAN
	Mr. Barish.

		JOEL
	How exactly is this going to work
	tonight?

As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
and monotonous.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll start with your most recent
	memories and go backwards -- There is an
	emotional core to each of our memories --
	As we eradicate this core, it starts its
	degradation process --  By the time you
	wake up in the morning, all memories
	we've targeted will have withered and
	disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking.

		JOEL
	Is there any sort of risk of brain
	damage?

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, technically, the procedure itself
	is brain damage, but on a par with a
	night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll
	miss.

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly
he gets it.

		JOEL
	It's happening now!  I'm already in my
	brain.

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, I suppose you are.
		(back in his faded memory
		 persona)
	So, let's get started -- If we want the
	procedure underway tonight, we have some
	work to do.

Joel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches
from the corner.

		STAN
	We use the articles you brought to create
	a map of Clementine in your brain.
	Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to
	trace the map and erase.

		JOEL
	But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's
	already started.  I'm home in my bed.

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to
Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction.

		STAN
	Very good.

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel
studies it.  The machines register his response.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll dispose of these mementos when
	we're done here.  That way you won't be
	confused later by their unexplainable
	presence in your home.

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record
his reaction.

		STAN
	Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs.

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick, do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice
continues.

		STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	-- and check the voltage levels, I'm not
	wiping as clean as I would like here.

Joel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The
machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

		PATRICK
	The voltage looks fine.

		STAN
	Then check the connections.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

		PATRICK
	Does that help?

		STAN
	Yeah, that looks better.  Thanks.

INT. LAB ROOM - DAY

The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  Stan
pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  Mierzwiak smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, your journal.  This will be
	invaluable.

		STAN
		(reading)
	December 15th, 2004.  I met someone
	tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what
	to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's
	amazing.  So alive and spontaneous and
	passionate and sensitive.  Things with
	Naomi and I have been stagnant for so
	long.

The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on.

		STAN'S VOICE
	I think we got this one.  Let's push on.

Joel looks up at the ceiling.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed
home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation.

The scene is fading as he continues to write.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel looks for an office number.  He finds it.  The plaque on
the door reads Lacuna Ltd.  Joel enters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room.  Mary sits in the
reception area.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		JOEL
	My name is Joel Barish.  I have an
	appointment.

		MARY
	Please have a seat.  Dr. Mierzwiak will
	be right with you.

INT. OFFICE HALL - DAY

Mary leads Joel down the hall.

		MARY
		(without turning)
	How are you today?

		JOEL
	Not great.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area.  Joel looks at
the tape recorder.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm sorry you saw one of our notification
	cards.  You never should have.

		JOEL
	Well... I did.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about your relationship
	with Clementine.

		JOEL
		(thinks, then:)
	It was a mess.  I don't know how it got
	this way...

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	It's kind of a dump, don't you think?

Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is checking out the apartment.  Stan monitors the
equipment.

		STAN
		(uninterested)
	It's an apartment.

		PATRICK
	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
	Uninspired.  And there's a stale smell.
	Sort of stuffy.  I don't know.  Stuffy.

		STAN
	Patrick, let's just get through this.  We
	have a long night ahead of us.

		PATRICK
	Yeah.

Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a
moment.  He glances at the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	So who do you think is better-looking, me
	or this guy?

Stan glances sideways at Patrick.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area.

		MIERZWIAK
	So we'll need you to go home and bring in
	everything you ever received from
	Clementine and anything that might remind
	you of her...

The scene is faded and disappearing fast.  It's gone.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL
	So then she just stops calling.

		VOICE-OVER
	I wasn't going to call her.  Not after
	the way she was.

		JOEL
	Any messages, Carmen?

Carmen the receptionist shakes her head.

Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Any messages for me, Carmen.

		CARMEN
	Nothing, Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's bullshit.  She's punishing me for
	being honest with her.

Joel is at his office desk on the phone.

		PHONE MACHINE VOICE
	You have no messages.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in
conversation with someone else.

		JOEL
	Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages?

Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel checks his machine: zero messages.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's it.  I'm just gonna--

Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone.

		VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)
	I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing
	games and --

		RECORDED VOICE
	The number you have dialed has been
	disconnected.

Joel's eyes bug.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's.

		JOEL
	Why would she do that?

		VAGUE RECORDED VOICE
	-- If you think you have reached this
	recording in error, please check your
	number and dial again.

		CARRIE
	I don't know, honey.  It's horrible.

		JOEL
	She's punishing me for being honest.  I
	should just go to her house.

		ROB
	I don't think you should go there, Joel.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.

		CARRIE
	Maybe you need to look at this as a sign
	to move on.  Just make a clean break.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe
	she'd be so goddamn immature!

		ROB
	Joel, look, the thing is --

		CARRIE
		(agitated, interrupting)
	Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog.
	Would you just wait here?  Just a second.

Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and
close the door behind them.  Joel hears a hushed argument
ensue in the hall.  He notices the dog asleep on the floor.
He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it
distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  A
subscription card falls to the floor.  He picks it up and is
about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not
a subscription card at all.  It reads:

 Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her
  memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her
		 again.  Thank you.

		     Lacuna Ltd.
		     610 11th Avenue, NY, NY

Joel stares at the card, incredulous.

Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room.

		CARRIE (CONT'D)
	You weren't supposed to see that.

		JOEL
	They can't erase memories.  It's a joke.
	It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

		CARRIE
	Sweetie, we called the company.

Joel just stands there.

Close-up of a vague dictionary page.

		VOICE-OVER
	Lacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing
	portion, especially in a manuscript.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is on the phone pacing.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	You can't tell her, Joel.  They explained
	that.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It
	might have a devastating effect.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives past vague local landmark.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Think about it: to be told you lived an
	existence of which you have no
	recollection.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	But what am I supposed to do?

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Move on, sweetie.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	How can I?  How can I move on when I know
	I'm the only one to carry this love we
	had?  How do I do that?

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in
movie closed for the season.  He weeps.  The windows fog up
until the outside is completely obscured.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel looks for an address.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Joel gets off on the sixth floor.  He searches for a room
number.  As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is
faded, vague and mostly erased.  He keeps walking, comes to
the door marked Lacuna and opens it.  Inside he can see
vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.

		MARY
		(dead monotone)
	Hi, May I help you?

These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself
and hear what's going on in his bedroom.

		STAN'S VOICE
	So, Mary's coming over tonight.

Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan works the joystick.  Patrick sits on the bed with Joel.

		PATRICK
	Yeah?

		STAN
	Just wanted to let you know.

		PATRICK
	I like Mary.  I like when she comes to
	visit.  I just don't think she likes me.

		STAN
	She likes you okay.

		PATRICK
	I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend
	over, too.  I have a girlfriend now.

		STAN
	You can if you want.

		PATRICK
	Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

		STAN
		(re: memory on monitor)
	This one's history.  Moving on...

		PATRICK
	The thing is ... my situation is a little
	weird.  My girlfriend situation.

		STAN
	Patrick, we need to focus.

Stan aims the joystick.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back
to the book.  The door opens.  He looks up.  Clementine is
staggering in, drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yo ho ho!

		JOEL
	It's three.

		VOICE-OVER
	Shit.  The last time I saw you.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.  I
	kinda sorta wrecked your car...

		JOEL
	I can't believe you wrecked my car.

		JOEL
	You're driving drunk.  It's pathetic.

		CLEMENTINE
	...a little.  I was a little tipsy.
	Don't call me pathetic.

		JOEL
	Well it is pathetic.  And fucking
	irresponsible.  You could've killed
	somebody.

The scene is starting to degrade.  The acting becomes anemic.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't know, maybe you did kill
	somebody.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.  It's
	just a fucking dent.  You're like some
	old lady or something.

		VOICE-OVER
	Right!  She called me an old lady here,
	too!  And I remember, I said...

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	And what are you like?  A wino?

		CLEMENTINE
	A wino?  Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
	A wino!
		(laughs)
	Face it, Joel.  You're freaked out
	because I was out late without you, and
	in your little wormy brain, you're trying
	to figure out, did she fuck someone
	tonight?

		JOEL
	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked
	someone tonight.  Isn't that how you get
	people to like you?

This shuts Clementine up.  She is stung and she starts
gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
apartment.  Joel is immediately sorry he said this.  He
follows her around.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I'm sorry.  Okay.  I didn't mean that.  I
	just... I was just... pissed, I guess.

Clementine is out the door.  Joel follows.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping
off in the distance.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Joel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down his
window to talk to her.

		JOEL
	Let me drive you home.

		CLEMENTINE
		(without turning)
	Fuck you, Joel.  Faggot.

		JOEL
	Look at it out here.  It's falling apart.
	I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy.

She keeps clomping.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	You did it to me.  I can't believe you
	did this to me.  By morning you'll be
	gone.  Ha!

He stops the car, gets out.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the
distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	See, remember that girl?  The one we did
	last week?  The one with the potatoes?

Joel looks up, startled.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan watches the screen.  Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at
the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK
	I gotta tell you something.  I kind of
	fell in love with her last night.

		STAN
	She was unconscious, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	She was beautiful.  So sweet and funky
	and voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair
	of her panties, is what.

		STAN
	Jesus, Patrick!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	I know.  It's not like... I mean, they
	were clean and all.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Look, just don't tell me this stuff.  I
	don't want to know this shit.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Yeah, okay.

		STAN'S VOICE
	We have work to do.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV.
It's hard to make out what they're watching.
They sit on opposite ends of the couch.  They look bored.
The scene quickly degenerates.  The room fades.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Okay, but there's more.

Joel listens.

		PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	After we did her, I went to where she
	worked and I asked her out.

Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch.
She stares straight ahead at the TV.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick... do you know how unethical...

		JOEL
	That must be the guy I saw you with.

		VOICE-OVER
	In the bookstore that night.  The skinny
	guy.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel watches TV.  Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks
at the TV.  She slips into a skirt.

		CLEMENTINE
	How can you watch this crap?

		JOEL
	Where are you going?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine puts on her shoes and
heads out the door.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily.  They barely look
at the animals.  Clementine watches parents with babies.

		JOEL
	Oh shit.  I remember this.
		(to Clementine)
	Want to go?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	I want to have a baby.

		JOEL
	Let's talk about it later.

		CLEMENTINE
	No.  I want to have a baby.  I have to
	have a baby.

		JOEL
	I don't think we're ready.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not ready.

		JOEL
	Clementine, do you really think you could
	take care of a kid?

She turns violently toward him, glaring.

		CLEMENTINE
	What?!

		JOEL
		(mumbly)
	I don't want to talk about this here.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!

Joel looks around.  People are watching.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You can't fucking say something like that
	and say you don't want to talk about it!

		JOEL
	Clem, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have --

		CLEMENTINE
		(screaming now)
	I'd make a fucking good mother!  I love
	children!  I'm creative and smart and I'd
	make a fucking good mother!

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine's rant continues but
becomes attenuated and vague.

		JOEL
	Oh, thank God.  It's going.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's you!  It's you who can't commit to
	anything!  You have no idea how lucky you
	are I'm interested in you!  I don't even
	know why I am!  I should just end it
	right here, Joel.  Leave you in the zoo.
	Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
	out with!

She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
emotion in it.  The scene is a husk.

		JOEL
	It's going, Clementine.  All the crap and
	hurt and disappointment.  It's all being
	wiped away.

She looks up at him.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm glad.

Their eyes lock.  She is fading before his eyes.

		JOEL
	Me, too.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

It's noisy and crowded.  Joel and Clementine sit at a small
table.  She is drunk and staring off, blankly.

		JOEL
	So, um --

		CLEMENTINE
		(swiveling head toward him)
	Would you get me another, Joely?

Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanky!  Thanky!

Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.

Joel is paying the bartender.  He turns with the drink to
head back to the table.  He sees Clementine flirting with a
man in Joel's seat.

Joel is at the table.  Clementine looks from her
conversation.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, this is Mark.  He likes my boobs.
	He came over special to tell me that.
	Isn't that nice.  He doesn't think I'm
	fat.

The scene starts to fade.  Mark rises.

		MARK
	I didn't know she was with someone, man.

		CLEMENTINE
	S'okay, Mark.  Joel doesn't like my
	boobs.
		(stage whisper)
	I don't think he likes girls.

The bar gets quiet and vague.

		JOEL
	You're drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're a whiz kid.  So perceptive, so --

Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible
words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.

A doorbell buzzes.  Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick opens the door.  Mary stands there in a winter coat,
carrying a backpack.

		MARY
		(coolly)
	Oh, hey, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	Hi, Mary.  How's it going?

She walks past him.

		STAN
	Hey, you.

Stan and Mary kiss.  She looks down at Joel as she takes off
her coat.

		MARY
	It's freezing out.

		STAN
	You found us okay?

		MARY
	Yeah.
		(re: Joel)
	Poor guy.
		(looking around)
	Have anything to drink?

		STAN
	We haven't checked.

		MARY
	Well, allow me to do the honors.  It's
	fucking freezing and I need something.

She heads into the kitchen.  Stan turns back to monitor the
slivers of light.

		PATRICK
	Mary hates me.  I've never been popular
	with the ladies.

		STAN
	Maybe if you stopped stealing their
	panties.

		PATRICK
		(guilty beat)
	Okay, There's more, Stan --

Stan looks over at Patrick.  Mary returns with a bottle of
scotch and two glasses.

		MARY
	Hey, hey.

She pours the whiskey.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did
	you?

		PATRICK
	Nah, I don't know.

Mary hands a glass to Stan.  She holds hers up in a toast.

		MARY
	Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
	the better even of their blunders.

Mary and Stan click glasses.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Nietzsche.  Beyond Good and Evil.  Found
	it my Bartletts.

		STAN
	That's a good one.

		MARY
	Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!  It
	seems really appropriate.

		STAN
		(a little sulky)
	It's a good one all right.

		PATRICK
	What's your bartlett's?

		STAN
	It's a quote book.

		MARY
	I love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill.
	He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's
	about Bartlett's.  Isn't that trippy?

		PATRICK
		(trying to engage)
	Yeah.  Cool.

		MARY
	"The quotations when engraved upon the
	memory give you good thoughts."

		PATRICK
	Very cool.  Trippy.

		MARY
	I like to read what smart people say.  So
	many beautiful, important things.

		STAN
	Yup.

		MARY
	Don't you think Howard's like that?
	Smart?  Important?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Yup.

		PATRICK
	Definitely!

		MARY
	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.

Stan focuses on the monitor.  Mary pours herself another
drink.

		PATRICK
	Definitely.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel and Clementine are in bed.  The memory is
already in the midst of being erased.  Clementine is talking
in a monotonous, robotic manner.

		CLEMENTINE
	You don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an
	open book.  I tell you everything.  Every
	damn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust
	me.

		JOEL
	No, it isn't that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to know you.

		JOEL
	I just don't have anything very
	interesting about my life.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, you're a liar.

The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there
for a moment, registering Clementine's statement.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence.  Joel looks around
at other couples in the restaurant.  Some seem happy and
engaged.  Others seem bored with each other.  He turns back
to his food.

		JOEL
	How's the chicken?

		VOICE-OVER
	Is that like us?  Are we just bored with
	each other?

		CLEMENTINE
	Good.

He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself
another glass.  She holds the wine bottle up to Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	More?

		JOEL
	No.  Thanks.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	How's the fish?

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	It's good.

They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? --
	Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I
	kind of have to study for my test --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed.  Stan watches the
lights on the computer screen.

		PATRICK
	Hold on.  Let me ask my friend.
		(covering mouthpiece)
	Stan, can I leave for a little while?  My
	girlfriend is very --

		STAN
	Patrick, we're in the middle of --

		PATRICK
	She's right in the neighborhood.  She's
	upset.

Mary is in the kitchen.  She pokes her head out.  She's got
some pie on a plate.

		MARY
	Let him go, Stan.  I can help.

		STAN
		(sighing, to Patrick)
	Go.

		PATRICK
		(quietly)
	Mary hates me.
		(into phone)
	I'll be right over, Tangerine.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Candles are lit.  Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on
the living room rug listening to music.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joely...

		JOEL
	Yeah, Tangerine?

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's my favorite book.  Since I was a
	kid.  It's about these toys.  There's
	this part where the skin Horse tells the
	rabbit what it means to be real.
		(crying)
	I can't believe I'm crying already.  He
	says, "It takes a long time.  That's why
	it doesn't often happen to people who
	break easily or have sharp edges, or who
	have to be carefully kept.  Generally by
	the time you are Real, most of your hair
	has been loved off, and your eyes drop
	out and you get loose in the joints and
	very shabby.  But these things don't
	matter at all, because once you are Real
	you can't be ugly, except to people who
	don't understand."

She's weeping.  Joel is stroking her hair.  They kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket.  It's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

		JOEL
		(screaming)
	No!  Jesus, No!

He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
She continues as if she's still being made love to, even
though Joel is completely beside himself.  He jumps up naked
and yells at the ceiling.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Please!  Please!  I've changed my mind!
		(looks down at fading
		 Clementine, then at ceiling)
	I don't want this.  Wake me up!  Stop the
	procedure!  Plea --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still.  Mary and
Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint.  After a silence:

		MARY
	It's amazing, isn't it?  Such a gift
	Howard gave the world.

		STAN
		(a sigh)
	Yeah.

		MARY
	To let people begin again.  It's
	beautiful.  You look at a baby and it's
	so fresh, so clean, so free.  And
	adults... they're like this messy tangle
	of anger and phobias and sadness...
	hopelessness.  And Howard just makes it
	go away.

		STAN
	You love him, don't you?

Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for
a long moment.

		MARY
	No.
		(beat)
	Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a
	very serious and ethical man.  I'm not
	going to tempt him to betray all he
	believes in.

Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges
through the snow.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's
crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings
open the door and hugs him.

		PATRICK
	Oh, baby, what's going on?

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I
	feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting
	old and nothing makes any sense to me.

		PATRICK
	Oh, Tangerine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes
	any sense.

She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Come up to Boston with me?

		PATRICK
	Sure.  We'll go next weekend and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to
	see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight!

		PATRICK
	Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit.

She runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and
realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's
thought, he *69's.  The phone rings.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message
	after the beep.

Beep.

		PATRICK
		(whisper)
	Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Hey, where are you?

		PATRICK
	I got into a situation with the old lady.
	Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm
	really sorry, man.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Stan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary,
stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft
and low on the stereo.

		STAN
	I can handle it.  He's pretty much on
	auto-pilot anyway.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		PATRICK
	Thanks, Stan.  I owe you.

Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He
pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then
pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the
bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what
he's looking for.  He reads:

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I took Joel to walk on Charles River with
	me last night.  It was so beautiful and
	charming.  Joel was nervous about
	stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to
	please me so much -- he's so sweet --
	that he came out after me.    We lay down
	right in the center and watched the
	stars.  He took my hand and said "I
	could...

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
river.  They look up at the stars.

		JOEL
	...die right now, Clem.  I'm just...
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love
and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased.
Joel is panicked.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Clem, no!  This can't keep happening.
	Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please!

Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her
sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about --

		JOEL
	You have to stop this!

		MIERZWIAK
	What?  What do you mean?

		JOEL
	I'm trapped in my head and everything I
	love is being erased!  Stop it now!

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, but... I'm just something you're
	imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your
	head, too.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick reads the journal.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	... and we made love right on the ice.
	It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It
	was wonderful.

Clementine enters, dressed for the cold.  Patrick puts the
notebook away.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm so excited.  Yay!

		PATRICK
	I'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to
	give you this.  It's a little... thing.

Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's gorgeous.
		(slipping it on)
	Just my taste.  I've never  gone out with
	a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I
	liked.
		(kisses him)
	Thanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.

		CLEMENTINE
	Such a beautiful view.

		JOEL
		(looking at her)
	Yes indeed.
		(snapping out of memory)
	Fuck!  They're erasing you, Clem!

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh?

		JOEL
	I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But
	I want it to stop, before I wake up and
	don't know you anymore.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wow.  Um, well... can't you just force
	yourself awake?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

He concentrates.  Nothing happens.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Aaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped!

He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
feet, screaming.  But even while he's doing this the memory
and Clementine are fading around him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's raining out.  Joel is reading, slouched in a chair.  He
looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her
underwear.  She's reading, too.

		VOICE-OVER
	She's so sexy.

		JOEL
	I loved you on this day.  I love this
	memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging.

Clementine looks over at him, smiles.  Her brow furrows in
thought.

		CLEMENTINE
	What if you hide me?

		JOEL
	What do you mean?

		CLEMENTINE
		(formulating)
	Well... if they're looking for me in
	memories I'm in, what if you take me to a
	memory I'm not in?
		(proud)
	And we can hide there till morning.

Joel ponders this.  The scene and Clementine are beginning to
dissolve.  Joel grabs Clementine's hand.  She giggles with
glee.  He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades.

		JOEL
	Where?  Where?  Where?

He drags her through the landscape of already decayed
memories and turns off into:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is dated and vague.  Joel and Clementine are in
an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  Joel wears
footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  He
holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  Clementine is
still in her panties and bra.  An oversized woman in high
heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth
preparing dinner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus.  What's this?

Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.

		JOEL
	I must be about two.
		(oddly)
	I want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not
	looking at me.
		(back to himself, re: doll)
	Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told
	you about this!
		(beat)
	I want my mommy!

He starts to cry.  Clementine tries to comfort him.  She hugs
him.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(crying still)
	I want my mommy.
		(adult, to Clementine)
	I don't want to lose you, Clem.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm right here.

		JOEL
	I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't
	want to lose you.  I don't want to
	lose...

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.
	The memory.  I think we're hidden.

Joel sucks in some snot.  His mother scurries back and forth
clanging pots.  The room is not decaying.  Joel smiles.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering
after sex.  Stan suddenly perks up.  He looks at the monitor.

		STAN
	It's stopped.

		MARY
	What?

		STAN
	Listen, it's not erasing.

He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It's not erasing.  He's off the screen.

		MARY
	Where?

		STAN
	I don't know.  He's not on the map.

Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  He fiddles
nervously with the equipment.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I don't know what to do!  I don't know
	what to do!  Crap.  Crap...

		MARY
	Well, what should we do?

		STAN
	I don't know!  I just said that!

		MARY
	Sor-ry
		(beat)
	We have to do something.  He can't wake
	up half done.

		STAN
	Shit!

He jerks the joystick spastically.  Mary, also naked, gets up
and looks over his shoulder at the screen.

		MARY
		(definitely)
	We should call Howard.

Stan turns and looks at her.  He's stoned and trying to
understand her motivation.

		STAN
	No way.  I can handle this.

		MARY
	This guy's only half cooked.  There's no
	time to fuck around, Stan.

Stan tries to think.  He paces.  Mary watches him.  Finally:

		STAN
		(without making eye contact)
	Okay.

He dials the phone, waits.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	Hello, Howard?

INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is dark.  A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone.
His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening.

		MIERZWIAK
	Stan?  What's going on?

		STAN'S VOICE
	The guy we're doing?  He's disappeared
	from the map.  I can't find him anywhere.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, what happened right before he
	disappeared?

		STAN'S VOICE
	I was away from the monitor for a second.
	I had it on automatic.  I had to go pee.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, where was Patrick?

		STAN'S VOICE
	He went home sick.

		MIERZWIAK
	Jesus.  All right, what's the address.

		STAN'S VOICE
	1062 Sherman Drive.  Apartment 1E,
	Rockville Center.

Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.  He hangs up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary.

		MARY
	He's coming?

		STAN
	You better go.

		MARY
	Hell no.

She starts getting dressed.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Shit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to
	see me stoned.  Stop being stoned, Mary!

She hurries into the bathroom with her bag.

		MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God, I look like shit!  God!

Mary slams the bathroom door.  Stan puts his head in his
hands.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel and Clementine are in the playpen.  Joel's oversized
mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the
head.

		MOTHER
	How's my baby boy?

She's gone.

		JOEL
	I really want her to pick me up.  It's
	weird how strong that desire is.

Clementine holds his hand.  He looks over at her.

		CLEMENTINE
	You know, we're okay.  They're not
	finding us.  You'll remember me in the
	morning.  And you'll come to me and tell
	me about us and we'll start over.

		JOEL
	I loved you so much this day.  On my bed
	in your panties.  I remember I thought,
	how impossibly lucky am I to have you on
	my bed in your panties.

She kisses him.

		CLEMENTINE
	You remember what happened next?

		JOEL
	I came over to the bed and you smelled so
	good, like you just woke up, slightly
	sweaty.  And I climbed on the bed with
	you and you said something like --

		CLEMENTINE
	-- another rainy day.  Whatever shall we
	do?

He laughs.  She unbuttons his pajamas.  They begin to make
love.  Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen.  Joel stops,
looks at Clementine.

		JOEL
	There's this guy!

		CLEMENTINE
	What?

		JOEL
	There's this guy.  I heard him talking in
	my apartment.  He's one of the eraser
	guys.  And he fell for you when they were
	erasing you, so he introduced himself the
	next day as if he were a stranger and now
	you're dating him.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Is he cute?

		JOEL
	He stole a pair of your panties while you
	were being erased!

		CLEMENTINE
	Gross! You must remember to tell me this
	in the morning.  I'm, like, so freaked
	out now.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S CAR - NIGHT

It's a rust bucket.  Clementine drives through the snow.
She's crying and holding Patrick's hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	What's wrong with me?

		PATRICK
	Nothing is wrong with you.  You're the
	most wonderful person I've ever met.

She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even
harder.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan works on trying to get the signal back.  His hair is
combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but
still stoned.  Mary is pacing nervously to and from the
window, looking out into the night.  She's dressed also, and
she's wearing more make-up now.  Her hair is pulled up into
some sort of style.  Suddenly she freezes at the window.

		MARY
	There he is.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Do
	I look okay?

She doesn't say anything.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	I'm still stoned.  Are you?  Crap.

She looks in the mirror.

		MARY (CONT'D)
		(to Joel)
	Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.

The doorbell buzzes.  Mary lunges for the door, then calms
herself before opening it.  Mierzwiak, holding an equipment
bag, looks surprised.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary.  What are you doing here?

		STAN
	She came to help, Howard.

		MARY
	I wanted to learn as much about the
	procedure as possible, Howard.  I think
	it's important for my job...to help
	comfort the clientele.  You know.

Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters.  Mary
closes the door.  Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.

		MIERZWIAK
	Let's get to the bottom of this.  Shall
	we?

He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Odd.

He fiddles some more.  Mary looks on, fascinated.

		STAN
	I tried that already.

		MIERZWIAK
	Did you try going through C-Gate?

		STAN
	Yeah.  Of course.

Mierzwiak ponders.  He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out
another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm going to do a Spectrum search
	throughout his memory, see if anything
	comes up.

Mierzwiak presses some more buttons.  The program starts up.
A much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this
screen.  It rotates.  Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small
distant light in the brain.  He zeroes in on it.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Okay, here it is.  I don't know why it's
	off the map like that, but --

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized
mother.  Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing.
The mother doesn't seem to see her.

		MOTHER
	Little baby getting awwwl cleean.  Awl
	clean.

		JOEL
		(to Clementine)
	I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's
	such a feeling of security.

		CLEMENTINE
		(giggling)
	I've never seen you happier.

The elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's
mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the
kitchen, Clementine.   Joel is thrown into:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in
movie theater.  The movie on the giant screen is partially
obscured by a fence.  Joel and Clementine drink wine.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, we're back in.

		MARY
	That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
	Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, thank you, Mary.

		STAN
		(sighing)
	You get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it
	from here.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yeah, probably a good idea.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what
the characters on the screen are saying.

		CLEMENTINE
	But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

		JOEL
	Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.

She starts to fade.  The scene starts to fade.  Joel
remembers their previous plan.

		JOEL
	They found us before.  The plan didn't
	work.  I don't know what to do now.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mouthing to woman on screen)
	Hide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere
	buried?

Joel grabs her.  They run off just as the scene decays into a
husk behind them.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan is back at the controls.  Mierzwiak's at the door with
Mary.

		STAN
	Howard, they've disappeared again.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh dear.

		MARY
	I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.

He nods, distractedly.  She smiles to herself as he heads
back to the equipment.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON

Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
building toward the bike rack.  Clementine is with him,
dressed as she was in the parked car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look at you, cutey!  What are we doing?

		JOEL
	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the
	shit out of me.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm terrified.  I thought if I hung
	around the art room long enough, he'd go
	home and I could get my bike.

They head toward the bike rack.  Joel's is the only bike
remaining.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Poor Joel.

They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.

		JOE EARLY
	Hi, Jill.

		JOEL
	He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill
	after this.

The other kids laughs.

		JOEL
	Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home.

		JOE EARLY
	I don't think so.  We're fighting.

		JOEL
	I don't want to fight you.

The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."  Joe Early
throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.  joel falls
and stays down, covering himself.

		JOE EARLY
	C'mon, Jill.  Get up, faggot.  C'mon.

Joel doesn't say anything.  He peeks humiliated at
Clementine.  She's watching him.  She's got a tear in her
eye.  She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.

		JOEL
	I'm too scared to even throw a punch.
	When I tell people this story I leave
	that part out.

The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mierzwiak is at the machine.

		MIERZWIAK
	We got him back.  Stan, I think I'm just
	going to have to get through this
	manually.  We're running late.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

It's cold.  Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up.  She
points at a house up the beach.

		CLEMENTINE
	Our house!  Our house!

She runs ahead, laughing.  The scene is decaying.  Joel
chases after her.

		JOEL
	Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
	Remember?

He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel, junior high school size, is in bed
masturbating.  Clementine is in there, too, in her winter
coat, still laughing from before.  She realizes what's going
on.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mock offended)
	Joel!

		JOEL
		(continuing to masturbate)
	I don't like it either, but I'm just
	trying to find horrible secret place to --

Joel's mother pops her head in the door.

		MOTHER
	Joel, I was just --
		(sees what's going on)
	Oh.  Um... I'll ask you in the morning,
	honey.  Have a good night.

The mother backs out, closes the door.  Joel cringes.
Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was
swiped from.  Flash!  It's all gone.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle
on a slice of cheesecake in front of her.  Joel hands her a
small wrapped box.

		JOEL
	Happy Birthday.

		CLEMENTINE
		(unwrapping the gift)
	Thanks, Joely.  A present!  Oh boy!

She pulls out the bracelet.  It's the same bracelet Patrick
gave her.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, Joel.  It's beautiful!
		(slip it on)
	I mean, you're the first guy who ever
	bought me a piece of jewelry I could
	honestly say that about.

He notices she's starting to fade.

		JOEL
	I scoured the city for it.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love it!

She leans across the table to kiss him.  He grabs her and
runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Joel is one of a group of five year olds.  He holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.  The other
boys are goading him.

		BOYS
	C'mon, Joel, you have to.  Do it already.

Joel doesn't want to.  Clementine watches.

		JOEL
	I can't.  I have to go home.  I'll do it
	later.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to do this.  But I had to
	or they would've called me a girl.

Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom.  The
kids hoot.

		VOICE-OVER
	I can't believe I did that.  I'm so
	ashamed.

A live bird watches from a tree.  Clementine, still dressed
for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
Joel away from the other boys.  The two of them walk down
Joel's suburban street.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay.  You were a little kid.
		(beat)
	This is a great birthday present.
	Getting to see you as a boy.

She kisses him and they walk holding hands.

		JOEL
		(pointing)
	That's where I live.  Lived.

Joel looks down at her hand.  It's fading.  The bracelet is
gone.  Clementine is gone.  His childhood house is gone.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak works the equipment.  He has located a small area
of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm getting the hang of it.  I still
	understand it.  But I'm finding him
	quickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't
	be too much peripheral eradication.

Mary sits on the bed.

		MARY
		(a little giggly)
	I like watching you work.

Stan sighs, grabs his coat.

		STAN
	I'll go out for a smoke.  If no one
	minds.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	That's fine, Stan.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Stan huffs and is out the door.
Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  Mary
gets up her courage to speak.

		MARY
	Do you like quotes, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	How do you mean?

		MARY
	Oh, um, like famous quotes.  I find
	reading them inspirational to me.  And in
	my reading I've come across some I
	thought you might like, too.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh.  Well, I'd love to hear some.

Mary is thrilled, beside herself.  She tries to calm down.

		MARY
	Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed
	are the forgetful, for they get the
	better even of their blunders."

		MIERZWIAK
	Is that Nietzsche?

		MARY
	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was
	thinking I could tell you something you
	didn't know.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we
	both know it.

He smiles at her.  She's flustered, flattered.

		MARY
		(sputtering)
	There's another one I like, I read.  It's
	by Pope Alexander.

		MIERZWIAK
	Alexander Pope?

		MARY
	Yes, shit.  Oops, sorry!
		(puts hand over mouth)
	Sorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't
	going to say Pope Alexander and sound
	like a dope and then I go ahead and do
	it.  Like I psyched myself out.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's no big deal.

		MARY
	You are such a sweetheart.

There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the
	blameless Vestal's lot!  The world
	forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal
	sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each
	prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

She smiles, proud and embarrassed.

		MIERZWIAK
	That's lovely.

		MARY
	Really?  I thought it was appropriate
	maybe.  That's all.
		(beat, then quickly)
	I really admire the work that you do.  I
	know it's not proper to be so familiar
	but I guess since we're outside the
	workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

		MIERZWIAK
	It's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it.

		MARY
	Okay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks.
		(blurting)
	I like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is
	that terrible?

Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his
unflappable self.

		MIERZWIAK
	You're a wonderful girl, Mary.

She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.

		MARY
	I've loved you for a very long time.  I'm
	sorry!  I shouldn't have said that.

		MIERZWIAK
	I've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know
	that.

		MARY
		(suddenly weepy)
	I wish I was your wife.  I wish I had
	your kids.

Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  It turns into kiss.  He
pulls away.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can't do this.

		MARY
	No you're right.  Once again.  You're a
	decent man, Howard.

He smiles sadly at her.  She smiles courageously at him.

		MIERZWIAK
	I want you to know it's not because I'm
	not interested.  If that means anything.

They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back
to locating and eradicating blips of lights.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an
unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches
Mierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It
appears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up
outside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out,
checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only
lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's
resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.
This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The
woman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to
unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
He practically shrieks and jumps up.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up
simultaneously.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary looks confusedly at Howard.

		MARY
	What?

She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who
turns and walks off in a huff.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh my God!

Mierzwiak is already in his coat.  He's out the door.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The woman is at her car.  Stan watches from the van.
Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.

		MIERZWIAK
	Hollis!  Hollis!

		HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
	I knew it, Howard.  I don't even know why
	I bothered to copy the damn address.

		MIERZWIAK
	It didn't start out to be this.  I came
	here to work.  It's a one-time mistake.

Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now.  Hollis is in her car.

		MARY
		(heroically)
	Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true.  And it's not
	Mr. Mierzwiak's fault.  I'm a stupid
	little girl with a stupid little crush.
	I basically forced him into it.  I swear.

Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.

		HOLLIS
	Don't be a monster, Howard.  Tell the
	girl.

Stan is out of the van now, listening.  Mary shivers in the
cold, hugs herself.  There's a long silence.  Then:

		MARY
	Tell me what?

Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes.  Mary looks back and
forth between them.  Hollis starts her car.

		HOLLIS
	Poor kid.  You can have him.  You did.

She drives off.  Mary watches Howard with increased
foreboding.

		MARY
	What, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	We... have a history.  I'm sorry.  You
	wanted the procedure.  You wanted it
	done... to get past.  I have to finish in
	there.  It's almost morning.  We'll talk
	later.

He shuffles inside.  Mary stands there, unable to digest
this, struggling in vain to remember.  Stan watches.

		STAN
	Let me take you home.

Mary shakes her head "no."  She walks off, dazed.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
and look up at the night sky.

		PATRICK
	I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Their eyes meet.  She sobs.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to go home.

She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
continues, now running.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT

Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car.  She tries
to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing
the job.  Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the
map of Joel's brain.  He targets it.

EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY

Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
oversized father.  Clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love this book, Joel.  Thank you so
	much for telling me about it.

Joel is his father.  The father is drunk and sullen.  He
faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.

		FATHER
	Don't be like me, son.  Don't waste your
	life.  You'll come to a point someday
	where it'll be too late.  You'll be sewn
	into your fate...

		JOEL
	It was horrifying, seeing my father like
	that.
	There was no hope for me if his life was
	such a failure.  And he saw failure in
	me, too, written in my future.

Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, you're not sewn in.  He's wrong.

		FATHER
	...and there'll be nowhere to go except
	where you're headed, like a train on a
	track.  Inevitable, unalterable.

The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across
from Clementine.  He is ragged and jarred.

		JOEL
	I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride
	it out.  Hiding is clearly not working.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.

		JOEL
	I want to enjoy my little time left with
	you.

		CLEMENTINE
	This is our first "date" date.

		JOEL
	Do you remember what we talked about?

		CLEMENTINE
	Naomi, I guess.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	What was I wearing?

		JOEL
	God, I should know.  Your hair was red.
	I remember it matched the wallpaper.

		CLEMENTINE
	Egad, were you horrified?

		JOEL
	No!  I think you were wearing that black
	dress, y'know, with the buttons.

She is wearing the black dress.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, you were with me when I bought that.
	At that place on East 6th.  It was later.

INT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP

The scene has already been erased.  It's just a decayed husk.
A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Clementine wears a generic black dress now.

		JOEL
	Right.  Something black though.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll buy that.  Black's always good.

		JOEL
	We did talk about Naomi.

		CLEMENTINE
	I said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure.

		JOEL
	I'm sure, I said.

		CLEMENTINE
	But you weren't.  I could tell.

		JOEL
	I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't
	think of anything to say.  There were
	long silences.

There is a long silence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd
	mistaken infatuation for love.  You said:

		CLEMENTINE
	So what.  Infatuation is good, too.

		JOEL
	And I didn't have an argument.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house.

		JOEL
	I dropped you off after.  You said --

		CLEMENTINE
		(Mae West)
	Come up and see me... now.

		JOEL
	It's very late.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, exactly.  Exactly my point.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex.

		JOEL
	This was our first time.

The scene starts to fade.  Joel watches Clementine disappear.

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

Mary enters the dark room, frazzled.  She flips on the
fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one
with her name on it.  Her jaw drops.  With a shaky hand, she
puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	Okay, so just tell me what you remember.
	And we'll take it from there.

		MARY'S VOICE
		(shaky)
	Um, I liked you immediately.  At the job
	interview.  You seemed so... important
	and mature.  And I loved that you were
	helping all these people.  You didn't
	come on to me at all.  I liked that.  I
	was tongue-tied around you at first.  I
	wanted you to think I was smart.  You
	were so nice.  I loved the way you
	smelled.  I couldn't wait to come to
	work.  I had these fantasies of us being
	married and having kids and just...
		(starts to cry)
	...and so... then... when...
	that one day, when I thought you looked
	at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't
	do this?  How can I do this?

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	It's what's best, Mary.  You know that.

Mary slumps to the floor.  We move into her eyes.

		MARY'S VOICE
	Yeah, I know.  Oh, God.  Okay, well, I
	was so excited...

A SERIES OF MURKY IMAGES.  NO DETAIL.

A flirtatious look from Mierzwiak.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	...Remember you bought me that little
	wind-up frog?

A vague shot of a wind-up frog.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	And you said...

A vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"This is for your desk.  Just a little
	token"

Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	I knew then... I knew something was going
	to happen... something wonderful.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits in the quiet living room.  The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Naomi.

		VOICE-OVER
	On the couch.  Dark.  Quiet.  I wondered
	if I had made a terrible mistake.  I
	almost reached for the phone about a
	thousand times.  I thought I could take
	it back, erase it, explain I had
	momentarily lost my mind. Then I told
	myself we weren't happy.  That was the
	truth.  That what we were was safe.
	It was unfair to you and to me to stay in
	a relationship for that reason.  I
	thought about Clementine and the spark
	when I was with her, but then I thought
	what you and I had was real and adult and
	therefore significant even if it wasn't
	much fun.   But I wanted fun.  I saw
	other people having fun and I wanted it.
	Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one
	is really having fun; I'm being suckered
	by advertising and movie bullshit... then
	I thought maybe not, maybe not.  And then
	I thought, as I always do at this point
	in my argument, about dying.

INT. ROOM - DAY

An elderly man sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I projected myself to the end of my life
	in some vague rendition of my old man
	self.  I imagined looking back with a
	tremendous hole of regret in my heart.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't pick up the phone to call you,
	Naomi.  I didn't pick up the phone.

The scene dissolves.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Namoi is red-eyed from crying.  She is packing things in
boxes.  Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what
to say.  She holds up a book.  The scene starts to fade.

		NAOMI
	Yours?

		JOEL
	You take it.  I don't know.

She tosses it in a box.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Naomi, I really value our relationship.
	I hope it's possible for us to stay in
	touch.

		NAOMI
	Don't do this to me now, Joel.  Really.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in
the trunk of a car.  There's another woman down there with
her.  They get into the car and drive off.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel talks to Clementine.  The scene is fogging over.

		JOEL
	I told her today I need to end it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Is that what you want?

		JOEL
	I did it.  I guess that means something.

Clementine shrugs.  The scene fades.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Joel walks with Naomi.

		NAOMI
	So what's going on, Joel?

		JOEL
	I don't know, I've just been thinking,
	maybe we're not happy with each other.

		NAOMI
	What?

		JOEL
	Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort
	of, unhappy with each other and --

		NAOMI
	Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

		JOEL
	I think maybe, we're both so used to
	operating at this level that -- How can
	one person be unhappy?  If one person is
	unhappy, both have to be... by
	definition.

		NAOMI
	Bullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone.

		JOEL
	No.  I just need some space, maybe.

		NAOMI
	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you
	think you have with this chick, once the
	thrill wears off, you're just going to be
	Joel with the same fucking problems.

		JOEL
	It's not somebody else.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hate myself.

Naomi walks off.  Joel watches her.  The scene fades.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel enters, looks around.  There's no sign of Clementine.
Joel approaches a male employee.

		JOEL
	Is there a Clementine who works here?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #1
		(calling to another male
		 employee)
	Mark, is Clem on tonight?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #2
	On my dick, bro.
		(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed)
	Oh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in
	Philosophy.

Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.

		JOEL
	Hi.

She turns.

		CLEMENTINE
	I didn't think you'd show your face
	around me again.  I figured you were
	humiliated.  You did run away, after all.

		JOEL
	Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm
	not a stalker.  But I needed to see you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(seemingly uninterested)
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	I'd like to... take you out or something.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you're married.

		JOEL
	Not yet.  Not married.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the
	bat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not
	going to tiptoe around your marriage or
	whatever it is you got going there.  If
	you want to be with me, you're with me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	So make your domestic decisions and maybe
	we'll talk again.

She goes back to stacking.  Joel stands there helplessly.

		JOEL
	I just think that you have some kind
	of... quality that seems really important
	to me.

The scene is disintegrating.  Clementine's speech is
delivered without passion.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to
	just keep that in your head.  Too many
	guys think I'm a concept or I complete
	them or I'm going to make them alive, but
	I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking
	for my own peace of mind.  Don't assign
	me yours.

		JOEL
	I remember that speech really well.

		CLEMENTINE
		(smiling)
	I had you pegged, didn't I?

		JOEL
	You had the whole human race pegged.

		CLEMENTINE
	Probably.

		JOEL
	I still thought you were going to save
	me.  Even after that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I know.

		JOEL
	It would be different, if we could just
	give it another go around.

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we
	can.

The scene is gone.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits forlornly in the back seat.  Rob drives and Carrie
sits in the front passenger seat.  The car stops in front of
Joel's apartment building.

		JOEL
	Thanks, guys.

		CARRIE
	I hope you feel better, sweetie.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CARRIE
	Say hi to Naomi.

The car door closes.

INT. BUILDING STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Joel climbs the stairs.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hope she's not up.  I need to think.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lights are off.  Joel sits on a chair near the window,
writing in his journal.  The streetlight illuminates the
paper.  Naomi sleeps in the bed.

		VOICE-OVER
	I met someone tonight at a party on the
	beach.  Her name is Clementine.  There is
	something alive about her.

Naomi turns over in bed, sees Joel.

		NAOMI
		(full of sleep)
	Hi.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		NAOMI
	How was it?

		JOEL
	You didn't miss much.  Rob Carrie say
	hello.

		NAOMI
	Hi, Rob and Carrie.

		JOEL
	Go back to sleep.

The room is starting to decompose.

		NAOMI
	Yeah.  Come to bed.  I'm cold.

		JOEL
	In a minute.

Naomi turns over.  Joel goes back to his writing.

		VOICE-OVER
		(more and more emotionless)
	I don't know what to do about this.  I've
	been feeling so alienated and numb
	lately.  Forever.  The thought of not
	acknowledging my feelings again seems
	self-destructive.
	How can I continue on this path toward a
	living death, a life filled with
	obligation and guilt and responsibility
	but joyless, hopeless?  I need to speak
	with Clementine.

The scene has turned to a husk.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater.  Naomi is at the
dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing.
Joel turns and watches her for a moment.

		JOEL
	So you don't mind?

		NAOMI
	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Okay.  I wish you could come.

		VOICE-OVER
	This is it.  The night we met.  My God,
	it's over.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Me, too.

He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head.  She
continues to write.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Say hi to Rob and Carrie.  Have some fun!

		JOEL
	I hope you get your work done.

		NAOMI
		(sighing)
	Yeah.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Rob drives.  Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front
passenger seat.  Joel sits in the back.

		CARRIE
	I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.  You
	okay?  You seem quiet.

		JOEL
	Just a little overworked, maybe.

		VOICE-OVER
	The trip to the party where I met
	Clementine.  My first memory of her is
	now my last memory of her.

Joel looks out the window.  Carrie turns around and says
something to Joel.  She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.

		JOEL
	I remember you turned around.  Your face
	was dark and your hair was backlit -- I
	could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me
	if things were okay between Naomi and me.

		CARRIE
	I did.  You said, things were fine.

		JOEL
	I remember.

		CARRIE
	This is the night you met Clementine,
	Joel.  I remember watching you walk down
	the beach with her and I thought, oh
	shit.

		JOEL
	Yeah, you told me that later.

		CARRIE
	I told you that later.

Joel looks out he window.  He sees the husk of a memory on
the darkened roadside.  It's Joel and Carrie in:

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Faded.  Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee.

		CARRIE
	Who was the girl you walked off with?

		JOEL
	No one.

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a
small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.

		CARRIE
	Is this the right way?

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
down the beach.  People and music can be heard.

EXT. BEACH - LATER

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

		JOEL
	You were down by the surf.  I could just
	make you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Your back to me.  In that orange
	sweatshirt I would come to know so well
	and even hate eventually.  At the time I
	thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

		VOICE-OVER
	I remember being drawn to you even then.
	I thought, I love this woman because
	she's alone down there looking out at the
	black ocean.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	But I went back to my food.  The next
	thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
	next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
	out of the corner of my eye.

A shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up.

		CLEMENTINE
	Hi there.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		VOICE-OVER
	I was so nervous.  What were you doing
	there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime
	green.  Green revolution.

A shot of her green hair.

		JOEL
	You said...

		CLEMENTINE
	I saw you sitting over here.  By
	yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone
	normal, who doesn't know how interact at
	these things either.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
	that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
	you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
	such a loser.  Every time I come to a
	party I tell myself I'm going to be
	different and it's always exactly the
	same and then I hate myself after for
	being such a clod.

		JOEL
	Even then I didn't believe you entirely.
	I thought how could you be talking to me
	if you couldn't talk to people?

		VOICE-OVER
	But I thought, I don't know, I thought it
	was cool that you were sensitive enough
	to know what I was feeling and that you
	were attracted to it.

		CLEMENTINE
	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
	ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of
	people do well at this stuff?

		VOICE-OVER
	And I just liked you so much.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You did?  You liked me?

		JOEL
	You know what I did.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing.

		JOEL
	You said --

She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of
	your chicken?

		JOEL
	And you picked it out of my plate before
	I could answer and it felt so intimate
	like we were already lovers.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I remember --

		VOICE-OVER
	The grease on your chin in the bonfire
	light.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh God, how horrid.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	No, it was lovely.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Hi, Joel.  So no jokes about my name?

		JOEL
	You mean, like...
		(singing)
	Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
	darlin', Clementine... ?  Huckleberry
	Hound?  That sort of thing?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, like that.

		JOEL
	Nope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when
	I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
	doll.  I think your name is magic.

She smiles.

		CLEMENTINE
		(eyes welling)
	This is it, Joel.  It's gonna be gone
	soon.

		JOEL
	I know.

		CLEMENTINE
	What do we do?

		JOEL
	Enjoy it.  Say good-bye.

She nods.

Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	So you're still on the Zoloft?

		VOICE-OVER
	Next thing I remember we were walking
	down near the surf.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I stopped.  I didn't want to feel
	like I was being artificially modulated.

		JOEL
	I know what you mean.  That's why I
	stopped.

		CLEMENTINE
	But my sleeping is really fucked up.

		JOEL
	I don't think I've slept in a year.

		CLEMENTINE
	You should try Xanax.  I mean, it's a
	chemical and all, but it works... and it
	works just having it around, knowing that
	it's there.  Like insurance.

		JOEL
	yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll give you a couple.  See what you
	think.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

		JOEL
	I love her.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Me, too!  I don't meet people
	who even know who she is and I work in a
	book store.

		JOEL
	I think she's great.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  There's this poem --

		JOEL
	Did this conversation come before or
	after we saw the house?

		CLEMENTINE
	I think, before.

		JOEL
	Seems too coincidental that way.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, maybe.

Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside
	gusts of wind,/And a house in which we
	don't live...

		JOEL
	Yeah, yeah.  It goes "Perhaps there is
	someone in this world to whom I could
	send all these lines"?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes!  I love that poem.  It breaks my
	heart.  I'm so excited you know it.
		(pointing to houses)
	Look, houses in which we don't live.

Joel chuckles appreciatively.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I wish we did.  You married?

		JOEL
	Um, no.

		CLEMENTINE
	Let's move into this neighborhood.

Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.  Joel
is nervous.

		JOEL
	I do sort of live with somebody though.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.

She walks to the next house, tries the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Male or female?

		JOEL
	Female.

		CLEMENTINE
	At least I haven't been barking up the
	wrong tree.

She finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Cool.

		JOEL
	What are you doing?

		CLEMENTINE
	It's freezing out here.

She scrambles in the window.  Joel looks around, panicked.

		JOEL
		(whisper)
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	I couldn't believe you did that.  I was
	paralyzed with fear.

The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's
	coming here tonight, believe me.  This
	place is closed up.  Electricity's off.

		JOEL
	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

		CLEMENTINE
	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

He walks cautiously toward the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had
	you.  You knew I knew that, right?

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door
behind him.

		JOEL
	I knew.

		CLEMENTINE
	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi
	wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
	criminally trespass.

		JOEL
	It's dark.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name?

		JOEL
	Naomi.

She's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out
a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles,
	matches, and the liquor cabinet.

		JOEL
	I think we should go.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, it's our house!  Just tonight --
		(looking at envelope on
		 counter)
	-- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which
	one do you want to be?  I prefer to be
	Ruth but I'm flexible.
		(opens cabinet)
	Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going
	find the bedroom and slip into something
	more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment.

She runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning
into a husk.

		JOEL
		(calling after her)
	I really should go.  I really need to
	catch my ride.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous.
	I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you
	were exciting.  You called from upstairs.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(flat)
	So go.

		JOEL
	I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt
	like I was a scared little kid.  I
	thought you knew that about me.  I ran
	back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
	humiliation.  You said, "so go" with such
	disdain.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(poking her head downstairs)
	What if you stay this time?

		JOEL
	I walked out the door.  There's no more
	memory.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come back and make up a good-bye at
	least.  Let's pretend we had one.

Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
way through the decaying environment.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Bye, Joel.

		JOEL
	I love you.

She smiles.  They kiss.  It fades.

		CLEMENTINE
	I --

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.  This scene,
too, is disintegrating.  It dries up and Joel is just
standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen
in the distance like a photograph.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front.

		CARRIE
	Did you have fun?

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.
He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all
has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Howard watches the monitor.  The last specks of light are
fading.  It grows dark.  He is tired, his eyes are hollow.
He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.

		HOWARD
	Okay.

Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up.  He pulls the
electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags.
Howard dials the bedside phone.  He waits as it rings.

		HOLLIS'S VOICE
	Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks.  We
	can't come to --

Howard hangs up.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back
of the van.  He and Howard look at each other.

		STAN
	So, I've got to drop the van off.

		MIERZWIAK
	Thanks, Stan.  Thanks.

INT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston.  Mary is
silent and depressed.  Patrick tries to break the silence.

		PATRICK
	You want to stop for coffee or something?

Mary shakes her head "no."  Long silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well, it was sure beautiful on that
	river.  Thanks for sharing it with me.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well do it again soon.

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNING

Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna."  He gets out,
crosses to his car.  Mary is sitting on the hood.

		STAN
	Hey.

		MARY
		(beat)
	Do you swear you didn't know?

		STAN
	I swear.

		MARY
	And you never even suspected?  Never saw
	us behaving in any unusual way together?

		STAN
	Once, maybe.

She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It was here.  At his car.  I was coming
	back from a job and spotted you together.
	You seemed caught.  I waved.  You
	giggled.

		MARY
	How did I look?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Happy.  Happy with a secret.

Mary starts to cry.

		MARY
	And after that?

		STAN
	I never saw you together like that again.
	So I figured I was imagining things.

Mary says nothing.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I really like you, Mary.  You know that.

		MARY
	Do you remember anything else?  What I
	was wearing?  Was I standing close to
	him?  Was I leaning against his car like
	I owned it?  How did he look at me when I
	giggled?  Tell me everything.

		STAN
		(thinking)
	You were in red.  That red sweater with
	the little flowers, I think.  You were
	leaning against his car.
		(thinking)
	He looked a little like a kid.  Kind of
	goofy and wide-eyed.  I'd never seen him
	look like that before.  Happy.  You
	looked beautiful.  You looked in love.

		MARY
		(heading toward the levator)
	Thanks, Stan.

She stops but doesn't turn to face him.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	You're nice.
		(beat)
	But I love him.  I knew I loved him.  Now
	I know.

He nods.  She waves, heads to the elevator.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Joel awakens.  The apartment is neat, like when he went to
sleep.  He gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

Joel waits on the crowded platform.  The platform across the
tracks is empty.  Joel's train arrives.  It's packed.  He
squeezes on with all the other commuters.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works in his cubicle over the light table.  He seems
distracted.  He dials his phone.  He's nervous.

		JOEL
	Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I
	know, I know.  It's been a long time.
	Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great!
	Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you
	dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free.
	Okay, good!

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary does paperwork at her desk.  She looks through her
reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with
their bags of stuff.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits.  He hangs up.  Mary
enters with the papers.

		MARY
	I need this signed, Howard.

He takes it, unable to make eye contact.  He signs it, hands
it back.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Thanks.
		(beat)
	So... do we talk about this... or what?

		MIERZWIAK
	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary.
	I want to do the right thing here.

		MARY
	Do you love me?  Did you love me?
	Something.  I listened to my tape.  I
	can't believe I've been sitting right in
	front of it for a year.  It's like
	listening to someone else's story.  I
	mean, I hear myself talking about having
	sex with you and I can't even imagine you
	naked.  I can't even say "naked" to you!

		MIERZWIAK
	I have a family, Mary.

		MARY
	You made me have an abortion.

		MIERZWIAK
	It was a mutual decision.

		MARY
	You made me have you erased!  I loved
	you.  I love you!  How could you --

		MIERZWIAK
	I didn't make you.  You thought it best.
		(off her stare)
	But, look, I take full responsibility.

She looks at him for a long while.  Then, out of frustration,
she screams.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel sits across from Naomi.

		NAOMI
		(oddly cautious)
	So... you haven't been involved with
	anyone in all this time?

		JOEL
	It's been a pretty lonely couple of
	years.

		NAOMI
	I'm sorry.

		JOEL
	Well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
	I'm sorry.

		NAOMI
	Oh, sweetie.  It really does cut both
	ways.  We were taking each other for
	granted and --

		JOEL
	I miss you.

		NAOMI
	Miss you, too.
		(awkward pause)
	I have been seeing someone for a little
	while.

		JOEL
		(trying for enthusiasm)
	Oh!  Great.  That's great!

		NAOMI
	A religion instructor at Columbia.  A
	good guy.  He's a good guy.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have --

		NAOMI
	I'm glad you called.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex.  There are certain
sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost
immediately.  She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way
that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to
him.  They finish and lie there.

		JOEL
	So you think the dissertation will get
	published?

		NAOMI
	I don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big
	public demand for books on Calvinism and
	Misogyny.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clementine lies in bed with Patrick.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.
The platform across the tracks from them is empty.  Suddenly,
Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He climbs
the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
empty platform.  An almost empty train pulls into that
platform.  Joel gets on the train and watches the business
commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
the station.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Mary gets out of bed.  She has been crying all night.  She's
a wreck.  She puts on some coffee then crosses into the
living room area.  Sitting there are piles of the files from
work.  She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address
onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  She
pulls another file out.  This one has Joel's name on it.  She
copies it onto an envelope.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel says goodbye to Clementine.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

Joel exits.  We stay on Clementine as she watches Joel head
to his car, tromping through the snow.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone.

		JOEL
	Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Hi.

		JOEL
	How's it going?

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Good.  I called you at work today.  They
	said you were home sick.

		JOEL
	I know.  I had to take the day to think.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Yeah, I tried you at home.  Did you get
	my message?

		JOEL
	I just got in.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Long day thinking.

Joel flips on messages with volume down.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I suppose so.

		NAOMI ON MACHINE
		(cheerful)
	Hi.  They told me you were sick!  So...
	Where are you?!  I had a really nice time
	last night.  Just wanted to say hi, so...
	hi.  Call me.  I'm home.  Call me!

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	That's me.

		JOEL
	There you are.
		(pause)
	Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall
	back into this fast without considering
	the problems we had...

		NAOMI
	Okay, Joel.  I suppose you're right.

		JOEL
	I had a good time last night.  I really
	did.

		NAOMI
	So I'm going to get some sleep.  I'm glad
	you're okay.

		JOEL
	We'll speak soon.

		NAOMI
	'Night.

She hangs up and Joel stands there for a minute feeling
creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	What took you so long?

		JOEL
	I just walked in.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hmmm.  Do you miss me?

		JOEL
	Oddly enough, I do.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Ha Ha!  You said, I do.  I guess that
	means we're married.

		JOEL
	I guess so.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine steps out onto it.  Joel follows nervously.

		CLEMENTINE
	Don't worry.  It's really solid this time
	of year.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	This is so beautiful.

She squeezes his hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	Isn't it?

She runs and slides on the ice.  Joel is by himself now.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  What if it breaks?

		CLEMENTINE
	What if?

Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars.  Joel
is paralyzed.  He looks back at the shore.

		JOEL
	I think I should go back.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, come here.  Please.

He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  She
reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand.
They look up at the stars.  She smiles, doesn't say anything
and snuggles closer to him.

		JOEL
	Listen, did you want to make love?

		CLEMENTINE
	Make love?

		JOEL
	Have sex.  Y'know --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, um...

		JOEL
	Because I just am not drunk enough or
	stoned enough to make that happen right
	now.

		CLEMENTINE
	That's okay.  I --

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that.
	This seems like the perfect romantic
	exotic place to do it and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Hey, Joel --

		JOEL
	-- and I'm just too nervous around you
	right now.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous, too.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you obviously don't know me.

		JOEL
	I'm nervous because I have and enormous
	crush on you.

She smiles up at the sky.

		CLEMENTINE
	Show me which constellations you know.

MONTAGE

We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
envelopes.  One by one they open the envelopes and pull out
tapes.  We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
people listen to their tapes.

EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel drops Clementine off.  She kisses him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel enters with his mail.  He opens a manila envelope, reads
the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo,
listens.  Joel dials the phone.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	Did you send this?  Is it a joke?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I probably got the same thing as you.

		JOEL
	I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've
	met you.  Who would even know to do this?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
		(matter of fact)
	Maybe it's true then.  It's my voice on
	the tape.

		JOEL
	That's what you have to say?  How could
	it be true?  I never even heard of any
	procedure like this.  It's a joke.

		CLEMENTINE
	Maybe.  Call someone who'd know.

MONTAGE

We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone.
We hear over and over:  "Is this true?", "Did this really
happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?"

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Carrie is on the phone.  She pauses nervously, then speaks:

		CARRIE
	Yes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't
	supposed to say anything.  They say it's
	like waking a sleepwalker.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Joel hangs up.  He dials the phone.

		JOEL
	It's true.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I know.  I spoke to my friend Magda.

Joel is immersed in the several page document.

		JOEL
	Look, I have to go.  I have to think.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Joel, we've fucked.  We've made love.
	Like a million times.  And we were so
	sweet and shy and inept with each other
	last night.  Isn't that lovely?

Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  He just
stands there dumbly.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	Come over here, sweetheart.  Please.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - LATER

Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages
together.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were closed off, non
	communicative, never told me what you
	were feeling.

		JOEL
	Says you were a bully...

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	A bully?  Moi?

		JOEL
	That's what it says.  You drank too much,
	you picked on me for being passive and
	timid.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, sounds like me.  Sorry, man.
		(reading)
	Says you were jealous and suspicious.

		JOEL
	Says you would sometimes disappear all
	night, then brag to me about your sexual
	conquests.

		CLEMENTINE
	Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or
	is that your way of putting it.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Doesn't sound like me.

		JOEL
	Says you were a slob, leaving trails of
	panties and dirty socks in your wake.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were constantly calling me a
	slob.
		(laughs)
	It's sexy that we were like a married
	couple, griping and overly-familiar and
	bored.  Don't you think?

		JOEL
		(considering)
	I sort of do.  But I only see it as a
	fantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up
	enough to be erotic.

		CLEMENTINE
	We should have sex.  It's old hat for us.

She smiles at nervous Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You know my body like the back of your
	hand.

She unbuttons her blouse.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Every curve, every freckle.

She takes off her shirt.  He stares at her.  He has clearly
never seen this body before.

		JOEL
	You're so beautiful.

She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her
waist for the first time.

INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding
their files, a stunned-looking lot.  There is a new woman in
the reception window.  The file cases behind her are bare.

		RECEPTIONIST
	May I help you?

		STAN
	I work here.  I used to work here.  Stan.
	Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean
	out my desk.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(into phone)
	Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes
	sir.
		(to Stan)
	He says he needs to see you.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Stan enters.  Mierzwiak is pale and pacing.

		MIERZWIAK
	She should not have done this, Stan.  As
	mad as she was... as justifiably --

		STAN
	I don't know what you're talking about,
	Howard.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary has stolen our files and is sending
	them back to people.

		STAN
	Jesus.

Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor
looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over
Stan's position.  He is in the process of interviewing a sad
young woman.

		YOUNG WOMAN
	... so I called everybody I know and
	asked them to tell me everything.  Now I
	know my entire history with him, but it's
	in the form of a story, I'm losing my
	mind.

		MIERZWIAK
	This is why people must never be told.
	It's like waking a --

		YOUNG WOMAN
	I don't know what to do.  Before I
	thought I was depressed for no reason.
	Now it's like I've been assigned a
	reason.

		PATRICK
	This never should've happened, ma'am.
	We'll take care of it.

		MIERZWIAK
	I know you don't like me much, Stan, but
	please talk to Mary.  She of all people
	should know this is a dangerous thing
	she's doing.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works over his light box.  His phone rings.

		JOEL
	Hi, it's Joel.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hey, lover.  Whatcha doing?

		JOEL
	I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I
	can till I can see you.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.

		JOEL
	You must have been crazy.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Guess what I'm wearing.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  Panties and --

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Your dried cum.

		JOEL
	Jesus.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're still excited by my irreverence.
	You haven't yet started to think of it as
	my "gratuitous need to shock."

		JOEL
	I can't stop thinking about you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay.  Meet me after work by the old mill.

		JOEL
	What old mill?  Is that somewhere we --

		CLEMENTINE
	I just wanted to say that.  Come by my
	house.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mary opens the door.  Stan stands there with two cups of take
out coffee.

		MARY
	Oh.

		STAN
	Hi.

		MARY
	What do you want, Stan?

		STAN
	Can I... I brought some --

She steps aside for Stan to enter.  He does, looks around,
sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	What's this?

		MARY
	Nothing.

		STAN
	I know what it is.

		MARY
	Then why did you ask me?

		STAN
	I don't know.  I just -- there are a lot
	of really confused people showing up at
	the office.

		MARY
	They have a right to know.  Howard is a
	thief.  He steals the truth.
		(suddenly weeping)
	I can't remember my baby!  I can't
	remember my baby.  It existed and I can't
	even remember.  Do you understand that?

Stan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary
slumps into a ball on a chair.

		STAN
	Mary, people come to him voluntarily.

		MARY
	I won't allow it.  Those who cannot
	remember the past are condemned to repeat
	it.  What do you think of that?  That's
	from my quote book.

		STAN
	The office is filled with people who want
	their memories re-erased.

		MARY
		(hysterically)
	Remember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo!

		STAN
	Mary... please.  This is hurting people.

Long pause, then:

		MARY
		(small)
	I don't want to hurt people.
		(breaking down)
	But these things happened!  All these
	little sadnesses, the big ones.  What if
	no one remembers?  What does that do to
	the world?
		(beat, quietly)
	Someone has to remember, Stan.

They look at each other.

EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	I was by myself in the park because my
	friend Davia was sick that day.  I was on
	a swing.  There was this smiling man
	walking a little bushy dog --

Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	The man said something like, "He's
	friendly --"

Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the
woman's.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"-- he won't bite."

		MAN
	He won't bite.  You can pet him if you
	want...

Shot of the girl petting the dog.

		MAN
	Do you want to give him a biscuit?

The girl nods.

		MAN (CONT'D)
	They're in my car.  Why don't you --

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE
	Excuse me?  Hello?

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary, with a headset on, looks up, startled.  She switches
off the tape.  She has been crying.  There's a pile of tapes
next to her.  The distraught woman is standing there.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
	I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak.  My name is
	Helene Kernfeld.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  The doctor will
	be with you momentarily.

The woman sits.  Mary presses an intercom button.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Howard, your 10:30.

She switches the tape back on.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	He took me to his car and ...

Vague shot of the girl being raped.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in
her lap, as she travels over the New York skyline.  We move
into her eyes.

INT. VAGUE SPACE

Vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined
space:

The young girl being raped by the man in the car.

A soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered
friends.

A couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.

		MAN
	I...I... I... find you physically
	repulsive!  I can't even look at you!

They look at each other in silence.

A little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession
of boys.

The aftermath of a car accident from the driver's POV.

Mary having an abortion.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman and her chair lift out of the line of
commuters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

It's modern and well-appointed.  The old woman enters, sits
behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the
drawer.   She takes some pills with water.  An old man
enters.

		OLD MAN
	How are you today, Mary?

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Let's see... Still dying, Howard.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	You don't have to jump down my throat.  I
	was trying to be nice.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Well, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.

Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back.
Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,
places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and
listens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  We watch the
color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.
Another old woman enters the office.  Old Mary looks up,
seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)
	May I help you?

		SECOND OLD WOMAN
	I'd like to make an appointment.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	I think the doctor is free this morning.
	He can probably take you right away for
	an initial consultation.

The second old woman smiles gratefully.

INT. OLD MAN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Old Howard works at his desk.  Old Mary enters with the
second old woman.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine
	Kruczynski.  She'd like to talk to you.

Old Howard and the old Mary eye each other.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	Hello, Ms. Kruczynski.  Nice to meet you.
	Please have a seat.

He indicates a sitting area.  She sits.  He joins her.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	Would you mind if I tape our discussion?

She shakes her hear.  He punches a couple of buttons on his
computer console.  A tape recorder starts up and his computer
screen lights up so only he can see it.  On it we see a whole
file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of
previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them
involving Joel Barish.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	So, why don't you begin by telling me why
	you've come here.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)
	Well, I met this man, Joel, three years
	ago at a senior dance...  We'd both been
	alone for so long and...

INT. TUBE - NIGHT

The old woman (Mary) travels in the commuter tube over
Manhattan.  It's late, the tube is mostly empty.  She has
earphones on.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	I remember Joel and I were having
	breakfast --

INT. VAGUE SPACE

An old man and the second old woman eat breakfast.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- I said something like we should go
	upstate and see the leaves change...

The old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly.  The
woman smiles, but there is no response... just a dead stare.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
		(CONT'D)
	He just stared at me as if I didn't
	exist.  As if I had never existed...

INT. TUBE - CONTINUOUS

The second old woman's (Clementine) voice drones tinnily on
in the distance.  The old woman with the earphones is dead,
her eyes glassy and unseeing.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- his eyes used to be so filled with
	love.  But it was gone.  How can I go
	back to being alone after seeing love?  I
	was alone for so long.  What had I done
	with my life?  I was alone so long.

INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to
modern versions of the erasing machines.  Two young
technicians monitor the equipment.  The woman's bedside phone
rings.  Her machine picks up.  After a moment:

		OLD MAN'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  What's going on, Clem?
	Why won't you call me back?  Please call
	me.  We need to speak.

The machine clicks off.  One of the technicians reaches over
and presses the "erase" button on the machine.

BLACK.

THE END
