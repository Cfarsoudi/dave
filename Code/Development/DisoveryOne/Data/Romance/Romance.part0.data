          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
          
          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
          
          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
          
          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
          
                                 RIDER
                    Hey -- sorry.
          
          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
          
                                 KAT
                    Leave it 
          
          He persists.
          
                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
          
          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.
          
          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
          
          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Did you change your hair?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    No.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You might wanna think about it
          
          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
          
          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
          
                                 BOY
                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Awesome shoes.
          
          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.
          
          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
          
          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I don't think so, ma'am
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.
          
          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
          
          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
          
          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I missed you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    With the teeth of your zipper?
          
          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You the new guy?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So they tell me...
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the 
                    tour.
          
          They head out of the office
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    So -- which Dakota you from?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    North, actually.  How'd you   ?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I was kidding. People actually live 
                    there?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by 
                    the cows, though.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    How many people were in your old 
                    school?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thirty-two.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Get out!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    How many people go here?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Couple thousand. Most of them evil
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through 
          the crowd as he points to various cliques.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    We've got your basic beautiful people. 
                    Unless they talk to you first, don't 
                    bother.
          
          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader 
          splendor.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Those 're your cowboys.
          
          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys  
          walk by.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That I'm used to.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.
          
          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled 
          around it.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.  
                    Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden 
                    movements around them.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Michael continues the tour
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    And these delusionals are the White 
                    Rastae.
          
          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets 
          lounge on the grass.  A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Big Marley fans.  Think they're black.  
                    Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a 
                    lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I 
                    mean.
          
          Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?
          
                                 DEREK
                           (very stoned)
                    Michael, my brother, peace
          
          Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the 
          cafeteria.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So where do you fit in all this?
          
          INT.  CAFETERIA - DAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Loud music and loud students.  Michael sits with a group of 
          studious-looking teens.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League, 
                    already accepted.  Someday I'll be 
                    sipping Merlot while those guys --
          
          He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various 
          passers-by.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    are fixing my Saab.  Yuppie greed is 
                    back, my friend.
          
          He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.
          
          Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO 
          MO.  Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael 
          without a look.
          
          Cameron is smitten
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That girl -- I --
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You burn, you pine, you perish?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Who is she?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't 
                    even think about it
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I could start with your haircut, but it 
                    doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to 
                    date until her older sister does.  And 
                    that's an impossibility.
          
          ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space 
          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English 
          Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that 
                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man 
                    and the Sea.  Any other comments?
                           (with dread)
                    Kat?
          
          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes 
          off her glasses and speaks up.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    I'm sorry?
          
                                 KAT
                    This book is about a guy and his 
                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial 
                    topic.
          
          The other students roll their eyes.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.
          
          JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, 
          makes fun of her from his row.
          
                                 JOEY
                    As opposed to a bitter self-righteous 
                    hag who has no friends?
          
          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
          
          Really gets fired up now
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess the school board thinks because 
                    Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's 
                    worthy of our time
          
          She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her 
          pill box.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte?  
                    Simone de Beauvoir?
          
          Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a 
          crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY, 
          embroidered on his workshirt.
          
                                 PATRICK

          The class titters.  Kat wears an expression of intolerance

          Kat now sits before Miss Perky.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've 
                    been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
          
                                 KAT
                    Expressing my opinion is not a 
                    terrorist action.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Well, yes, compared to your other 
                    choices of expression this year, today's 
                    events are quite mild.  By the way, 
                    Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation 
                    went quite well, in case you're 
                    interested.
          
                                 KAT
                    I still maintain that he kicked himself 
                    in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    The point is Kat -- people perceive you 
                    as somewhat ...
          
          Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tempestuous?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the 
                    term used most often.
          
          She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    You might want to work on that
          
          Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the 
          counselor's.
          
                                 KAT
                    As always, thank you for your excellent 
                    guidance.

          Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in 
          big flowing handwriting.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                    I realize the language of Mr. 
                    Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, 
                    but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
          
          Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip 
          of her hair to CHASTITY.  Chastity opens the note and reads:
          
          INSERT - "JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY  
          GOD!"
          
          Chastity frowns to herself.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                           (continuing)
                    Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment 
                    on what you've read so far?
          
          Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Not really.
          
          The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
          
          MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side 
          trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her 
          notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Mandella -- since you're assisting us, 
                    you might as well comment.  I'm assuming 
                    you read the assignment.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Uh, yeah, I read it all
          
                                 TEACHER
                    The whole play^
          
                                 MANDELIA
                    The whole folio.  All the plays.
          
                                 TEACHER
                           (disbelieving)
                    You've read every play by William 
                    Shakespeare?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Haven't you?
          
          She raises a challenging eyebrow.  The stunned teacher 
          doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are 
          eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
          
                                 MANDELLA
          
          Your sister is so amazingly without.  She'll never read him.  
          She has no idea.
          
          Kat attacks
          
                                 KAT
                    The fact that you're cutting gym so you 
                    can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear 
                    his name, is a little without in itself 
                    if you ask me.
          
          Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his 
          friends, lighting up a cigarette.  Mandella notices her 
          staring.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who's that?
          
                                 KAT
                    Patrick Verona   Random skid.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone 
                    for a year? I heard he was doing porn 
                    movies.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm sure he's completely incapable of 
                    doing anything that interesting.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    He always look so
          
                                 KAT
                    Block E?
          
          Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into 
          Mandella's hand.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a 
                    very slow way to die.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Just a little.
          
          She eats.  Kat sees her wrist
          
                                 KAT
                    What's this?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    An attempted slit.
          
          Kat stares at her, expressionless.
          
                                 KAT
                    I realize that the men of this fine 
                    institution are severely lacking, but 
                    killing yourself so you can be with 
                    William Shakespeare is beyond the scope 
                    of normal teenage obsessions.  You're 
                    venturing far past daytime talk show 
                    fodder and entering the world of those 
                    who need very expensive therapy.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    But imagine the things he'd say during 
                    sex.
          
          Thinks a minute
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, say you do it.  You kill 
                    yourself, you end up in wherever you end 
                    up and he's there.  Do you really think 
                    he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound 
                    compulsive who failed volleyball?
          
          Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
          
          ACROSS THE COURTYARD
          
          As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS   One of 
          the cohorts elbows Joey.
          
                                 COHORT
                    Virgin alert.
          
          Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' good, ladies.
          
          Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Tragic.
          
          Doesn't respond
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from 
          their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can 
          of beans linger on the grass behind them.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why do girls like that always like guys 
                    like that?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Because they're bred to.  Their mothers 
                    liked guys like that, and their 
                    grandmothers before them. Their gene 
                    pool is rarely diluted.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He always have that shit-eating grin?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish 
                    I could say he's a moron, but he's 
                    number twelve in the class.  And a 
                    model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's 
                    rumored to have a big tube sock ad 
                    coming out.
          
          The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their 
          empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries 
          to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    You know French?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You mean I'd get a chance to talk to 
                    her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You could consecrate with her, my 
                    friend.
          
          Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.  Joey pulls up 
          beside her in his Viper.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (re her dress)
                    The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't 
                    you been reading your Sassy?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, and I noticed the only part of 
                    you featured in your big Kmart spread 
                    was your elbow.  Tough break.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (practically 
                           spitting)
                    They're running the rest of me next 
                    month.
          
          He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.  
          Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in 
          a convertible.
          
                                 KAT
                    The people at this school are so 
                    incredibly foul.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You could always go with me.  I'm sure 
                    William has some friends.
          
          They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and 
          Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
          
                                 JOEY
                    Need a ride, ladies?
          
          Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.  He 
          pulls away with a smile.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
          
          Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's a charming new development
          
          Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the 
          tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
          
          As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his 
          moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
          
                                 KAT
                           (yelling)
                    Remove head from sphincter!  Then 
                    pedal!
          
          Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry 
          at the delay.
          
          Cameron rushes over
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You all right?
          
          He slows to a stop
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, just a minor encounter with the 
                    shrew.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's her?  Bianca's sister?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
          
          Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's 
          grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint 
          jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
          - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of 
          her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds 
          several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. 
          
          Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she 
          types.
          
                                 KAT
                    "Undulating with desire, Adrienne 
                    removes her crimson cape, revealing her 
                    creamy --"
          
          WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type 
          obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a 
          doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
          
          I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before 
          Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.
          
          He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to 
          kiss Sharon on the cheek.
          
                                 SHARON
                    In the microwave.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Kat)
                    Make anyone cry today?
          
                                 KAT
                    Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.
          
          Bianca walks in.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Where've you been?
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (eyeing Walter)
                    Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
          
          She kisses him on the cheek
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hello, precious.
          
          Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs
          
                                 KAT
                    How touching.
          
          Walter holds up a letter to Kat
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?
          
          Snatches it away from him.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I got in
          
          Sharon looks up from her computer.
          
                                 SHARON
                    What's a synonym for throbbing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of 
                    the country.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I thought we decided you were going to 
                    school here.  At U of 0.
          
                                 KAT
                    You decided.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is there even a question that we want 
                    her to stay?
          
          Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at
          
                                 KAT
                    Ask Bianca who drove her home
          
                                 SHARON
                    Swollen...turgid.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca; upset)
                    Who drove you home?
          
          Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's 
                    this boy... and I think he might ask...
          
                                 WALTER
                    No! You're not dating until your sister 
                    starts dating.  End of discussion.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What if she never starts dating?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Then neither will you.  And I'll get to 
                    sleep at night.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, 
                    Daddy!
          
                                 KAT
                    This from someone whose diary is 
                    devoted to favorite grooming tips?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Enough!
          
          He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Do you know what this is?
          
          He hits the "play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from 
          the tape recorder.
          
          BIANCA AND WALTER
                           (in unison, by 
                           rote)
                    The sound of a fifteen-year-old in 
                    labor.
          
                                 WALTER
                    This is why you're not dating until 
                    your sister does.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But she doesn't want to date.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Exactly my point
          
          His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich 
                    before you women start dilating?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Tumescent!
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Sharon; as he 
                           leaves)
                    You're not helping.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.  Bianca arrives 
          in a flurry of blonde hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can we make this quick?  Roxanne 
                    Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an 
                    incredibly horrendous public break- up 
                    on the quad.  Again.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, I thought we'd start with 
                    pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
          
          BIANCA
          Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    Okay... then how 'bout we try out some 
                    French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
          
          Bianca smiles slowly
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're asking me out.  That's so cute.  
                    What's your name again?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (embarrassed)
                    Forget it.
          
          Bianca seizes an opportunity.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have 
                    a proper introduction ---
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Cameron.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the 
                    mercy of a particularly hideous breed of 
                    loser.  My sister.  I can't date until 
                    she does.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Seems like she could get a date easy 
                    enough...
          
          She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled.
          
                                 BIANCA
          
          The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be 
                    really popular when she started high 
                    school, then it was just like she got 
                    sick of it or something.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's a shame.
          
          She reaches out and touches his arm
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Gosh, if only we could find Kat a 
                    boyfriend...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Let me see what I can do.
          
          Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
          
          INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
          
          A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.  
          Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You're in school for one day and you 
                    ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you 
                    have no concept of the high school 
                    social code?
          
          Cameron grins away
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I teach her French, get to know her, 
                    dazzle her with charm and she falls in 
                    love with me.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Unlikely, but even so, she still can't 
                    go out with you.  So what's the
                    point?
          
          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab 
          tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles 
          as he tries to revive his frog.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What about him?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (confused)
                    You wanna go out with him?
          
          The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (impatient)
                    No - he could wrangle with the sister.
          
          Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What makes you think he'll do it?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He seems like he thrives on danger
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard 
                    he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just 
                    got out of Alcatraz...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They always let felons sit in on Honors 
                    Biology?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He 
                    sold his own liver on the black market 
                    so he could buy new speakers.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Forget his reputation.  Do you think 
                    we've got a plan or not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Did she actually say she'd go out with 
                    you?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's what I just said
          
          Michael processes this.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca, 
                    you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.  
                    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I thought you hated those people.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients 
                    when I get to Wall Street.
          
          A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee 
          Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
          
          He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another 
          frog, with full-on sound effects.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'll let you handle that.
          
          INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
          
          Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
          
          Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his 
          jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway.  Inside 
          several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
          
                                 PEPE
                    Some people like the Colombian, but it 
                    all depends on your acidity preference.  
                    Me?  I prefer East African and 
                    Indonesian.  You start the day with a 
                    Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian 
                    Sidamo in your cup, you're that much 
                    farther ahead than someone drinkin' 
                    Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I 
                    mean?
          
          Michael nods solemnly.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that 
          looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
          
          Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hey, there
          
          In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his 
          direction.
          
          Cameron slinks away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Later, then. 
          
          Michael watches, shaking his head.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria 
          tray with a magic marker.
          
          Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Are you lost?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Nope - just came by to chat
          
                                 JOEY
                    We don't chat.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Well, actually, I thought I'd run an 
                    idea by you.  You know, just to see if 
                    you're interested.
          
                                 JOEY
                    We're not.
          
          He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to 
          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (grimacing)
                    Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't 
                    you?
          
          Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    But she can't go out with you because 
                    her sister is this insane head case and 
                    no one will go out with her. right?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Does this conversation have a purpose?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So what you need to do is recruit a guy 
                    who'll go out with her.  Someone who's 
                    up for the job.
          
          Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his 
          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage 
          can, rather than in it.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          That guy?  I heard he ate a live duck once.  Everything but 
          the beak and the feet.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Exactly
          
          Joey turns to look at Michael.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          What's in it for you?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will 
                    on my part.
          
          He rises to leave and turns to the others.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    I have a dick on my face, don't I? 
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork 
          off his face as Cameron watches.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got him involved?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when 
                    you let the enemy think he's 
                    orchestrating the battle, you're in a 
                    position of power. We let him pretend 
                    he's calling the shots, and while he's 
                    busy setting up the plan, you have time 
                    to woo Bianca.
          
          Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You're one brilliant guy
          
          Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
          
                                 MICHAEL
          
          Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but 
          it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who 
          Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. 
          
          Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a 
          manly way for the others, now watching.
          
          INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is 
          smoking.
          
                                 KAT
                    So he has this huge raging fit about 
                    Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to 
                    his male-dominated, puking frat boy, 
                    number one golf team school. I have no 
                    say at all.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William would never have gone to a 
                    state school.
          
                                 KAT
                    William didn't even go to high school
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's never been proven
          
                                 KAT
                    Neither has his heterosexuality.
          
          Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to 
          stub out Mandella's cigarette. 
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    I appreciate your efforts toward a 
                    speedy death, but I'm consuming.
                           (pointing at her 
                           food)
                    Do you mind?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Does it matter?
          
                                 KAT
                    If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any 
                    school you want, precious.  Don't forget 
                    your tiara."
          
          They both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the 
          counter to place his order.
          
          Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Janice Parker told me he was a roadie 
                    for Marilyn Manson.
          
          Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Janice Parker is an idiot
          
          INT.  MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
          
          Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (looking at chart)
                    I don't understand, Patrick.  You 
                    haven't done anything asinine this week.  
                    Are you not feeling well?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Touch of the flu.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm at a loss, then.  What should we 
                    talk about? Your year of absence?
          
          He smiles his charming smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How 'bout your sex life?
          
          She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Why don't we discuss your driving need 
                    to be a hemorrhoid?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What's to discuss?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, 
                    and as far as I can tell, you're only 
                    slightly psychotic -- so why is it that 
                    you're such a fuck-up?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Well, you know -- there's the prestige 
                    of the job title... and the benefits 
                    package is pretty good...
          
          The bell RINGS.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Fine.  Go do something repugnant and 
                    give us something to talk about next 
                    week.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various 
          desks.
          
          Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to 
          get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Look, it's really easy.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, 
                    sister.
          
          Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (rotely)
                    It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not 
                    related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a 
                    political figure.  I do not live in 
                    South Africa.  My parents just spent a 
                    few too many acid trips thinking they 
                    were revolutionaries.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                    But you freed our people
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Your "people" are white, suburban high 
                    school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I 
                    have not freed you, Trevor.
                           (grabbing his arm 
                           dramatically)
                    Only you can free yourself.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as 
          can be
          
                                 BIANCA
                    C'esc ma tete. This is my head
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Right.  See?  You're ready for the 
                    quiz.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I don't want to know how to say that 
                    though.  I want to know useful things.  
                    Like where the good stores are.  How 
                    much does champagne cost?  Stuff like 
                    Chat.  I have never in my life had to 
                    point out my head to someone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's because it's such a nice one.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Forget French.
          
          She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    How is our little Find the Wench A Date 
                    plan progressing?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, there's someone I think might be 
                    --
          
          Bianca's eyes light up
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Show me
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. 
          Bianca plays it cool.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Give me a sign when he walks by.  And 
                    don't point.
          
          The bell RINGS.  Kids flood past.  Then Patrick saunters by 
          with Scurvy.  Cameron nudges Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    There.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where?
          
          Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across 
          Patrick's path.  Patrick shoves him back against the wall 
          without a thought.  Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca's 
          feet.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I guess he didn't see me 
                           (calling after 
                           Patrick) 
                                     Some other time --
          
          Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in  her eye.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    My God, he's repulsive. He's so 
                    perfect!
          
          INT. GYM CLASS - DAY 
          
          Several volleyball games are being played.
          
          Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach 
          Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym 
          clothes.  They pull him aside roughly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (shrugging them 
                           off)
                    What?
          
          Joey points
          
          JOEY See that girl?
          
          Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the 
          ball into some poor cowboy's face.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah
          
                                 JOEY 
                    What do you think?
          
          Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared 
          of her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Two legs, nice rack...
          
                                 JOEY
                    Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out 
                    with her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You just said
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need money to take a girl out
          
                                 JOEY
                    But you'd go out with her if you had 
                    the cake?
          
          Patrick stares at Joey deadpan.  His dislike for the guy 
          obvious.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had 
                    the plane.
          
          Joey smiles.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, 
                    you do the honors.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're gonna pay me to take out some 
                    girl?
          
                                 JOEY
                    I can't date her sister until that one 
                    gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.  
                    She doesn't want a boyfriend.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    How much?
          
                                 JOEY
          
          Twenty bucks each time you take her out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I can't take a girl like that out on 
                    twenty bucks.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Fine, thirty.
          
          Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Take it or leave it.  This isn't a 
                    negotiation.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fifty, and you've got your man.
          
          Patrick walks away with a smile
          
          EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
          
          Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice 
          session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over 
          the field.
          
          Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette 
          dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
          
          MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                           (proudly) 
                    Good run, Stratford.
          
          Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick 
          hops down to follow.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Hey. Girlie.
          
          Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (smiles brightly)
                    Sweating like a pig, actually.  And 
                    yourself?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    There's a way to get a guy's attention.
          
                                 KAT
                    My mission in life.
          
          She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, 
                    you see, it worked.  The world makes 
                    sense again.
          
          Patrick's eyes narrow.  He steps closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Pick you up Friday, then
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, right.  Friday.
          
          PATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone
          
                                 PATRICK
                    The night I take you to places you've 
                    never been before.  And back.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?  
                    Do you even know my name, screwboy?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know a lot more than that
          
          Kat stares at him.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Doubtful.  Very doubtful.
          
          She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (calling after her)
                    You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
          
          Scurvy appears at his side
          
                                 SCURVY
                    So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a 
                    new Blaupunkt.
          
          ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He took the bait.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, 
          and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.
          
          She wacks Bianca away.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you ever considered a new look? I 
                    mean, seriously, you could have some 
                    potential buried under all this 
                    hostility.
          
          Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
          
                                 KAT
                    I have the potential to smack the crap 
                    out of you if you don't get out of my 
                    way.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you at least start wearing a bra?
          
          Kat SLAMS her door in response.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit
          
          SCURVY You up for a burger?
          
          Patrick looks in his wallet.  It's empty.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books.  Patrick 
          appears at her side, smiling.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          Kat doesn't answer
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    You hate me don't you?
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't really think you warrant that 
                    strong an emotion.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at 
                    the track with me.
          
                                 KAT 
                    And why would I do that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, 
                    you with money in your eyes, me with my 
                    hand on your ass...
          
                                 KAT
                    You -- covered in my vomit.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Seven-thirty?
          
          She slams her locker shut and walks away
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in  her 
          teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.  She 
          finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
          
          She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her 
          car
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
          
          Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Are you following me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I was in the laundromat. I saw your 
                    car. Thought I'd say hi.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Hi
          
          She gets in and starts the car.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not a big talker, are you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Depends on the topic. My fenders don't 
                    really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
          
          She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper, 
          which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
          
          Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- do you mind?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Not at all
          
          They continue on into the store.  Kat stares at them in 
          disbelief...
          
          Then BACKS UP
          
          Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious 
          Viper.
          
          Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the 
          liquor store.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing) 
                    You fucking bitch!
          
          Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.  Smiling 
          sweetly.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
          
                                 WALTER
                    My insurance does not cover PMS
          
                                 KAT
                    Then tell them I had a seizure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You 
                    punishing me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I thought you were punishing me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why can't we agree on this?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because you're making decisions for me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    As a parent, that's my right
          
                                 KAT
                    So what I want doesn't matter?
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're eighteen.  You don't know what 
                    you want.  You won't know until you're 
                    forty-five and you don't have it.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (emphatic)
                    I want to go to an East Coast school! I 
                    want you to trust me to make my own 
                    choices.  I want --
          
          Walter's BEEPER goes off
          
                                 WALTER
                    Christ!  I want a night to go by that 
                    I'm not staring a contraction in the 
                    face.
          
          He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing 
          Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.
          
                                 JOEY
                    When I shell out fifty, I expect 
                    results.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm on it
          
                                 JOEY
                    Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't 
                    count as a date.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I got her under control. She just acts 
                    crazed in public to keep up the image.
          
          Joey sees through the bluff
          
                                 JOEY
                    Let me put it to you this way, if you 
                    don't get any action, I don't get any 
                    action.  So get your ass on hers by the 
                    end of the week.
          
          Joey starts to walk off
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I just upped my price
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (turning)
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    A hundred bucks a date.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Forget it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget her sister, then.
          
          Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker,  
          then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing 
          scowl.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better hope you're as smooth as you 
                    think you are, Verona.
          
          Patrick takes the money with a smile.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY 
          Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?
          
          Bianca glares at him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    A "copine" is someone you can count on.  
                    An "ami" is someone who makes promises 
                    he can't keep.
          
          Cameron closes the French book
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got something on your mind?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I counted on you to help my cause. You 
                    and that thug are obviously failing.  
                    Aren't we ever going on our date?
          
          He melts
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You have my word.  As a gentleman
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're sweet.
          
          She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches 
          her toss her hair back
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (appreciative)
                    How do you get your hair to look like 
                    that?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days.  
                    And I never, ever use a blowdryer 
                    without the diffuser attachment.
          
          Cameron nods with interest.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You know, I read an article about that.
          
          Bianca looks surprised.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did?
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and 
          Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (without turning 
                           around) 
                    Say it
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (clearing his 
                           throat) 
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Whatever the hell it is you're standin' 
                    there waitin' to say.
          
          Cameron bravely steps forward
          
                                 CAMERON
                    We wanted to talk to you about the 
                    plan.
          
          Patrick turns toward them.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What plan?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The situation is, my man Cameron here 
                    has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What is it with this chick?  She have 
                    three tits?
          
          Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I think I speak correctly when I say 
                    that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than 
                    say -- Joey Dorsey's.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm 
                    just in this for the cash.
          
          Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his 
          beloved Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    That's where we can help you.  With 
                    Kat.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    So Dorsey can get the girl?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the 
                    big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set 
                    this whole thing up so Cameron can get 
                    the girl.
          
          Patrick smiles.  He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in 
          this game.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You two are gonna help me tame the wild 
                    beast?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (grinning) 
                    We're your guys.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    And he means that strictly in a non- 
                    prison-movie type of way.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Yeah -- we'll see.
          
          He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and 
          Cameron grinning at each other.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    We're in.

          CU on a party invitation as it gets handed out.  "Future 
          Princeton Grad Bogey Lowenstein proudly presents a Saturday 
          night bash at his abode.  Casual attire".
          
          Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    This is it.  A golden opportunity. 
                    Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    In that case, we'll need to make it a 
                    school-wide blow out.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Will Bogey get bent?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself 
                    with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

          Joey stands ac his open locker with Bianca.  The locker is 
          an homage to Joey's "modeling" career.  Cheesy PRINT ADS of 
          him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc. 
          -- adorn the locker door.

                    I think I like the white shirt
          
          Joey nods thoughtfully.

                                 BIANCA
                    Hopefully.
          
          He gives her his best flirtatious smile
          
                                 JOEY
                    Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if 
                    you won't be there.
          
          He taps her on the nose and she giggles
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM 
          Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure have.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (pouting)
                    I really, really, really wanna go, but 
                    I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem 
                    to be goin' for him.
          
          He fishes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing) 
                    She's not a...
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of 
                    Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm 
                    pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex 
                    tendencies.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So that's the kind of guy she likes? 
                    Pretty ones?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say 
                    is that she'd dip before dating a guy 
                    that smokes.
          
          Cameron furiously takes notes
          
                                 CAMERON
                    All right.  What else is she partial 
                    to?
          
          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 
          Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.
          
          He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the 
          bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.
          
          Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our 
          two non-deviants pass through.
          
          Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    What've you got for me?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I've retrieved certain pieces of 
                    information on Miss Katarina Stratford I 
                    think you'll find helpful.
          
          Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Patrick)
          
          One question before we start -- should you be drinking 
          alcohol when you don't have a liver?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?!
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Good enough.
          
          Cameron looks up at Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Number one.  She hates smokers
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    It's a lung cancer issue
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Her favorite uncle
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Dead at forty-one.
          
          Patrick sits up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Are you telling me I'm a - 
                           (spits the word 
                           out)
                    "non-smoker"?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Just for now.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat 
                    likes -- pretty guys.
          
          This is met with silence.  Then:
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?  You don't think I'm pretty?
          
          Michael smacks Cameron
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He's pretty!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Okay!  I wasn't sure
          
          Cameron goes back to the list.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist 
                    prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of 
                    the indie-rock persuasion".
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what does that give me?  I'm 
                    supposed to buy her some noodles and a 
                    book and sit around listening to chicks 
                    who can't play their instruments?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Ever been to Club Skunk?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow 
                    night.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Don't make me do it, man
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Assail your ears for one night.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's her favorite band.
          
          Patrick groans
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I also retrieved a list of her most 
                    recent CD purchases, courtesy of 
                    American Express.
          
          He hands it over.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Michael -- did you get this information 
                    "illegally"?
          
          Michael puts a finger to his lips.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I prefer to think of it simply as an 
                    alternative to what the law allows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm likin' you guys better
          
          He looks down at the list of CDs.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    This is really music?
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with 
          indie rock band posters and flyers.
          
          Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up 
          Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you turn down the Screaming 
                    Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.
          
          Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning 
          down the volume.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Don't tell me you're actually going 
                    out?  On a school night, no less.
          
          Kat shoots her a glare
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing; 
                           excited)
                    Oh my God, does this mean you're 
                    becoming normal?
          
                                 KAT
                    It means that Gigglepuss is playing at 
                    Club Skunk and we're going.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (disappointed)
                    Oh, I thought you might have a date
                           (beat)
                    I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, 
                    but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party Saturday night?
          
                                 KAT
                    What do you think?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I think you're a freak.  I think you do 
                    this to torture me.  And I think you 
                    suck.
          
          She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her.   Kat 
          doesn't bat an eye.  She grabs her purse and opens the door
          
                                 KAT 
                    Let's hit it.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the 
          line of kids below.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her 
          fake ID.  The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically 
          mono-syllabic.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (whispering to Kat) 
                    You think this'll work?
          
                                 KAT 
                    No fear.
          
          They approach Bruce.  Kat puts on her happy, shiny face
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!
          
          Bruce looks the girls up and down.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    I can count.
          
          He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, 
          wearing a face that could only be described as "I AM a 
          Victoria's Secret model."
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    I'll bet you can..
          
          She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.  Bruce stares 
          at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Go ahead.
                           (to Mandella)
                    And you
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (all come hither)
                    Yes?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Take it easy on the guys in there.
          
          Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows 
          behind, shaking her head.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked 
          PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the 
          boy's inside pocket.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Next time, leave the Bic at home, 
                    Skippy.
          
                                 SKIPPY
                    It's a bottle opener.
          
          Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Verona, my man.
          
          They shake.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Always a pleasure, Brucie.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss 
                    fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen 
                    belly-button ring for you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of 
                    minors come in?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Never
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. 
                    The other one kinda short and 
                    undersexed?
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Just sent 'em through.
          
          Patrick starts to go in
          
                                 BRUCE 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- what happened to that chick you 
                    brought last time?  The one with the 
                    snake?
          
          Patrick laughs and goes into the club
          
          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their 
          bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.
          
          Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss 
          finishes a song.
          
                                 LEAD SINGER
                    Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and 
                    we're from Olympia.
          
          A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to 
          scream.
          
                                 BOY (0.S.)
                    Pet my kitty!
          
                                 LEAD SINGER 
                    Meow
          
          They rev into their next song. 
          
          NEAR THE STAGE  
          
          Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the 
          opening chords of the song, they look at each other and 
          scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be 
          having a better time.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks 
          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and 
          Mandella singing along.
          
          HIS POV
          
          The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. 
          None of her usual "attitude".  Patrick is transfixed.  And 
          most definitely attracted.
          
          NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (shouting)
                    I need agua!
          
          She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR
          
          She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's 
          waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing to 
                           herself) 
                    Shit
          
          She sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks 
          away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed.
          
          The bartender arrives
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (shouting) 
                    What can I get you?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Two waters.
          
          She looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the 
          band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she 
          marches off, forgetting to pay.
          
          She walks up to Patrick.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing) 
                    You're not fooling anyone.
          
          Patrick looks at her, surprised
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    hey.  Great show, huh?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
          
          If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it 
          over with.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    Excuse me?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    That's what you want, isn't it?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling; gesturing 
                           toward the band)
                    Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it 
                    for me.
          
          Kat steams.  And watches him watch the band
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    You're not surrounded by your usual 
                    cloud of smoke.
          
          The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know.  I quit.
          
          He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.  She moves 
          closer.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Oh, really?
          
          He motions toward the stage
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill 
                    or The Raincoats, but they're right up 
                    there.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know who The Raincoats are?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Why, don't you?
          
          She's completely taken aback.  He uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I watched you out there   I've never 
                    seen you look like that
          
          Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          Her cheeks pinken.
          
          His cocky side is back in a flash
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    Come to that party with me.
          
          At that moment, the band starts another SONG
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling) 
                    What?
          
          The bartender approaches.
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (to Kat, yelling) 
                    You forgot to pay!
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    I got it, Rick.
          
          He tosses some bills on the bar
          
          Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to 
          figure out his motive.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing; 
                           yelling) 
                    Nine-thirty then.
          
          A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she 
          can't hear a word he's saying.  She gives him one last look 
          and heads back into the crowd.
          
          Patrick smiles.  She didn't say no this time.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst 
          them.  A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick 
          coasts by in his truck.  The gears GRIND.  He yells out the 
          window.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    What'd he say?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Who cares?
          
          Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Has he importun'd you with love in 
                    honourable fashion?
          
          Kat glances sharply at her.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (continuing; off 
                           her look)
                    Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor 
                    of romance.  You're the one that wants 
                    to march on Washington every five 
                    minutes.
          
          Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Gigglepuss was so beyond.
          
          Mandella nods.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    They were.  I only wish William could 
                    have been here to witness the rebirth of 
                    punk rock with us.
          
          Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the 
          car.
          
                                 KAT
                    So true.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So, then she says that she almost 
                    didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that 
                    dress because she thought she was 
                    mixing, you know, genres. And the fact 
                    that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -
                    "really meant something."
          
          Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    You told me that part already.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hell, I've just been going over the 
                    whole thing in my head and -
          
          Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder.  
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Hey.  Dingo Boingo
          
          Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around 
          slowly
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing; to 
                           Michael)
                    I hear you're helpin' Verona.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You and Verona?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What?  We took bathes together when we 
                    were kids.
          
          It's incredibly obvious that he's lying.  Joey eyes him then 
          turns to Cameron.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's your gig in all this?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm just the new guy.
          
          Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his 
          shirt and twisting it.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better not fuck this up.  I'm 
                    heavily invested.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- it's all for the higher good 
                    right?
          
          Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker 
          for good measure, as he walks away-
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Is it about me?
          
          EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and 
          annoyed.
          
          The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You're completely demented.
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (cheery)
                    See you next week!
          
          Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
          
          Miss Perky watches in horror
          
          MISS PERKY
          You two know each other?
          
                                 PATRICK/KAT 
                    Yeah/No.
          
          Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Patrick)
                    Dear God, stay away from her.  If you 
                    two ever decided to breed, evil would 
                    truly walk the earth.
          
          Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then 
          smiles-
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          The lights are on, illuminating the yard
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room.  MUSIC is 
          blaring and the door is shut.  Bianca looks at her watch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    She's obviously not going.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak 
          past.  Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.  The girls freeze.
          
          Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich 
          The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I --
          
                                 WALTER
                    And where're you going?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    If you must know, we were attempting to 
                    go to a small study group of friends.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Otherwise known as an orgy?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew 
                    you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria 
                    Steinem" over there isn't going --
          
          She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes 
          downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her 
          relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
          school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen.
          
          Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Do you know about any party? Katarina?
          
          Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an 
          apple
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, people expect me to be there!
          
                                 WALTER
                    If Kat's not going, you're not going.
          
          Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're ruining my life'  Because you 
                    won't be normal, I can't be normal.
          
                                 KAT 
                    What's normal?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but 
                    you're too busy listening to Bitches Who 
                    Need Prozac to know that.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
          
          Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can't you forget for just one night 
                    that you're completely wretched?
          
                                 KAT
                    At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked 
                    hedge-pig.
          
          Bianca tosses her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like I'm supposed to know what that 
                    even means.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard 
                    of him?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's 
                    boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not 
                    allowed to go out, I should obsess over 
                    a dead guy, too.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Girls
          
          Kat stares Bianca down
          
                                 KAT
                    I know about the goddamn party.  I'm 
                    going.
          
          Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst 
          into gleeful screams.
          
          A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, God.  It's starting.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy.
          
          Walter looks dazed.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Wear the belly before you go.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, no!
          
                                 WALTER
                    Just for a minute
          
          He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
          pregnancy belly.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I want you to realize the weight of 
                    your decisions.
          
          He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You are so completely unbalanced.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Can we go now?

                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca)
                    Promise me you won't talk to any boys 
                    unless your sister is present.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Why?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Because she'll scare them away.
          
          Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall 
          table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the 
          door and...
          
          There stands Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nine-thirty right?
          
          Kat's in shock
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I'm early.
          
          She holds up her keys
          
                                 KAT 
                    I'm driving.
          
          He peeks in behind her.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Who knocked up your sister?
          
          INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a 
          pro, handing out cigars and martinis.
          
                                 BOGEY
                    Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the 
                    right, shots in the kitchen.
          
          The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat 
          pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and 
          hollering within the jock crowd.
          
          Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey 
          sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the 
          doorway.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
          
          Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his 
          forehead.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline 
                    just recede?
          
          He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's 
          already walking away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Where ya goin?
          
                                 KAT
                    Away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Your sister here?
          
          Kat's face shows utter hatred
          
                                 KAT 
                    Leave my sister alone.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (smirking) 
                    And why would I do that?
          
          A RUCKUS sounds from the next room
          
                                 JOCK 
                    A fight!
          
          The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash 
          their cupfuls on each other.
          
                                 COFFEE KID #1
                    That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you 
                    Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
          
          Caffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to 
          watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into 
          the kitchen.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Just who I was looking for.
          
          He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out
          
                                 KAT 
                                 BIANCA
          
          Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
          
          A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts 
          another.
          
          GUY
          Drink up, sister.
          
          Patrick walks up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's this?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (mocking)
                    "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that 
                    what you're supposed to do at a party?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I say, do what you wanna do.
          
                                 KAT
                    Funny, you're the only one
          
          She downs another.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Cameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his 
          beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and 
          dishes dirt simultaneously.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (high-fiving a 
                           jock)
                    Moose, my man! 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters 
                    have already started calling.
          
          Cameron nods intently
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing; 
                           grabbing his belt)
                    Yo, Clem. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new 
                    Leanne Rimes. 
                           (with a Jamaican 
                           swagger)
                    Ziggy, peace, bra. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Prefers a water pipe, but has been 
                    known to use a bong.
          
          Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, 
          and points Cameron's body in her direction.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)

          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where did he go?  He was just here.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Who?

                    Joey.
          
          Cameron walks over.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Evening, ladies.
          
          Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Looks like things worked out tonight, 
                    huh?
          
          Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You know Chastity?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I believe we share an art instructor
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Great
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Would you mind getting me a drink, 
                    Cameron?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Certainly
                    Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
          
          Bianca gives him a tense smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Surprise me.
          
          He heads for the kitchen.  Joey walks up and grabs her 
          around the waist.
          
          She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just 
          as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and 
          straw -- in his hand.
          
          Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, 
          then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.
          
          Michael appears.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy 
                    just picks up a girl and carries her 
                    away while you're talking to her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're 
                    making progress.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No, I ' m not.
          
          He smacks himself in the head
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    She used me!  She wants to go out with 
                    Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!
          
          Michael pats him on the shoulder.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    At least you're self-aware
          
          BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a 
          drunken group hug singing "I Shot the Sheriff".  Kat has 
          another shot glass in hand.
          
          Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured 
          cheerleader.  He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes 
          then looks away.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer
          
                                 JOEY
                    So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog 
                    thing going -- and the tube sock gig " 
                    that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up 
                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Queen Harry?
          
                                 JOEY
                    It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, 
                    like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
          
          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting 
          difficult.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Neat...
          
                                 JOEY
                    My agent says I've got a good shot at 
                    being the Prada guy next year.
          
          He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.  Bianca 
          takes the opportunity to escape.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'll be right back.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.  Chastity 
          applies lip-gloss in the mirror.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He practically proposed when he found 
                    out we had the same dermatologist. I 
                    mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, 
                    but he's not exactly relevant party 
                    conversation.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Is he oily or dry?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Combination.  I don't know -- I thought 
                    he'd be different.  More of a 
                    gentleman...
          
          Chastity rolls her eyes
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Bianca, I don't think the highlights of 
                    dating Joey Dorsey are going to include 
                    door-opening and coat-holding.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're 
                    supposed to want to go out with are the 
                    ones we actually want to go out with, 
                    you know?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    All I know is -- I'd give up my private 
                    line to go out with a guy like Joey.
          
          There's a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very 
          drunken Kat.
          
                                 KAT
                    Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need 
                    to tell you --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (cutting her off)
                    I really don't think I need any social 
                    advice from you right now.
          
          Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
          
          Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Maybe you should let me have it.
          
          Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go
          
                                 KAT
                    I want another one
          
          Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting 
          him from his task.
          
                                 JOEY
                    My man
          
          As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of 
          dancing people in the dining room.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (annoyed)
                    It's about time.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    A deal's a deal.
          
          He peels off some bills
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    How'd you do it?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Get her to act like a human
          
          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and 
          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. 
          She's almost burlesque.
          
          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on
          
          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts 
          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.
          
          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. 
          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Okay?
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm fine. I'm
          
          She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs  
          her again, bracing her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not okay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I just need to lie down for awhile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to 
                    sleep
          
                                 KAT
                    I know, just let me sleep
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What if you have a concussion? My dog 
                    went to sleep with a concussion and woke 
                    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell 
                    the difference...
          
          She tries to sit on the floor
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, 
                    okay?
          
          He pulls her back to her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    C'mon, let's walk
          
          INT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs 
          his arm.
          
          CAMERON We need to talk.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron, I'm a little busy
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's off. The whole thing.
          
          Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h 
          back on her feet.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What 're you talking about?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She's partial to Joey, not me
          
          Patrick doesn't have time for this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron -- do you like the girl?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (impatient)
                    Then, go get her
          
          Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron 
          stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice
          
          EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
          
                                 KAT
                    This is so patronizing.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Leave it to you to use big words when 
                    you're shitfaced.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why 're you doing this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I told you
          
                                 KAT
                    You don't care if I die
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, I do
          
                                 KAT
                    Why?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because then I'd have to start taking 
                    out girls who like me.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like you could find one
          
                                 PATRICK
                    See that?  Who needs affection when 
                    I've got blind hatred?
          
                                 KAT
                    Just let me sit down.
          
          He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a 
          swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How's that?
          
          She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then 
          FALLS over backward.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus.  You're like a weeble
          
          Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the 
          swing to keep her entertained.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Why'd you let him get to you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who? 
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate him.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big 
                    deal to get you to mainline tequila. You 
                    don't seem like the type.
          
                                 KAT
                           (holding up a 
                           drunken head)
                    Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can 
                    be "cool"?  You don't think I can be 
                    "laid back" like everyone else?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (slightly 
                           sarcastic)
                    I thought you were above all that
          
                                 KAT
                    You know what they say
          
          He stops the swing
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No. What do they say?
          
          Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Shit!
          
          He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up 
                    damn it!
          
          He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag 
          doll.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Kat! Wake up!  
          
                                 KAT
                           (waking)
                    What?
          
          He sighs with relief.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you were...
          
          They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES 
          on his shoes.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a 
          big swig.
          
          A KNOCK sounds at the door
          
                                 KAT
                    Go away
          
          Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the 
          smuggest of all possible grins.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Dinner taste better on the way out?
          
          Gives her a "don't even start" look.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I don't get you.  You act like you're 
                    too good for any of this, and then you 
                    go totally apeshit when you get here.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're welcome.
          
          She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.
          
          KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kat's in the driver's seat.  Patrick leans in and takes the 
          keys out of the ignition.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cute
          
          BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Kids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside 
          Joey catches up to them.
          
                                 JOEY
                    A bunch of us are going to Jaret's 
                    house.  Wanna come?
          
          Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.  
          She looks at her watch.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have to be home in twenty minutes.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (eagerly, to Joey)
                    I don't have to be home 'til two.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Then, c'mon.
                           (to Bianca)
                    Maybe next time --
          
          They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca
          
          Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca 
          standing alone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (slightly 
                           accusatory)
                    Have fun tonight?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Tons
          
          He starts to walk on
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Cameron?
          
          He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Do you think you could give me a ride 
                    home?
          
          INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling 
          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and 
          Patrick quickly changes it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm driving, so I get to pick the 
                    tunes.
          
          She changes it back to her song.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's my car.
          
          He changes it back.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    And I'm in control of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like 
                    them.  I saw you there.
          
          Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her 
          listen to her song.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    When you were gone last year -- where 
                    were you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Busy
          
                                 KAT
                    Were you in jail?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Maybe.
          
                                 KAT
                    No, you weren't
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then why'd you ask?
          
                                 KAT
                    Why'd you lie?
          
          He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the 
          music.  She bobs her head drunkenly.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I should do this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 KAT
                    This.
          
          She points to the radio
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Start a band?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (sarcastically)
                    My father wouldn't approve of that that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You don't strike me as the type that 
                    would ask permission.
          
          She turns to look at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, so now you think you know me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm gettin' there
          
          Her voice loses it's venom
          
                                 KAT
                    The only thing people know about me is 
                    that I'm "scary".
          
          He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary 
          right now.  He tries to hide his smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.
          
          They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, 
          realizing they're both created the same exterior for 
          themselves.
          
          Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He 
          looks up at her house.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    So what ' s up with your dad?  He a 
                    pain in the ass?
          
                                 KAT
                    He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Who?
          
                                 KAT
                                 BIANCA
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No offense, but you're sister is 
                    without.  I know everyone likes her and 
                    all, but ...
          
          Kat stares at him with new admiration.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know -- you're not as vile as I 
                    thought you were.
          
          She leans drunkenly toward him.
          
          Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then 
          Patrick turns away
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So, I'll see you in school
          
          Kat stares at him, pissed.  Then gets out of the car, 
          SLAMMING the door shut behind her.
          
          CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
          He finally breaks it.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I looked for you back at the party, but 
                    you always seemed to be "occupied".
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (faux-innocence )
                    I was?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You never wanted to go out with 'me, 
                    did you?
          
          Bianca bites her lip.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (reluctant)
                    Well, no...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Then that's all you had to say.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You always been this selfish?
          
          BIANCA thinks a minute
          
          He pulls up in front of the house
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Just because you're beautiful, doesn't 
                    mean you can treat people like they 
                    don't matter.
          
          She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and 
          gives him a kiss on the lips.  He draws back in surprise, 
          then kisses her back.  She smiles, then gets out of the car 
          without another word.
          
          Cameron grins and drives away
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    And I'm back in the saddle.
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the 
          others enter.  The White Rastas are first.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of 
                    my heart.
          
          He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
          
          CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found 
          friendliness.
          
                                 CLEM
                    Yippe kai-aye, bra. 
                           (to Kat)
                    Dance for me, cowgirl.
          
          He sits next to Derek
          
                                 CLEM 
                           (continuing)
                    Okay, now tell me again why he didn't 
                    shoot the deputy?
          
                                 DEREK

                    my friend.  It was only the sheriff that 
                    was the oppressor.
          
          Joey saunters in and takes his seat.

                    Kat, babe, you were on fire.
          
          Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well now, did everyone have a good

                    Maybe we should ask Verona
          
          Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk.  Kat looks up, 
          down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.
          
          Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk 
          about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Okay then.  Well.

                    Oh, yes
          
          She clears her throat.

                    Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, 
                    whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate 
                    on his theme, however. Let's read it 
                    aloud, shall we? Anyone?
          
          The class is frozen in apathy.

          Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in 
          his seat. Then grins.

                    Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom 
                    pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as

                    You went to the party?  I thought we 
                    were officially opposed to suburban 
                    social activity.

                                 MANDELLA
                    You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat 
                    and what have you done with her?
          
                                 KAT
                    I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

                    I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.  
                    It was big fun.
          
          Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat 
          and smiles.

                    Hey
          
          She gathers her things and bolts out the door.  Patrick 
          looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.

                    So you got cozy with she who stings?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that 
                    I'm about to lose.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What'd you do to her?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I don ' t know. 
                           (beat)
                    I decided not to nail her when she was 
                    too drunk to remember it.
          
          Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then 
          turn back to Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          No shit.  She won't even look at me

          Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?
          
          Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility. 
          Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.

          Mandella is at her locker.  Drawings of William Shakespeare 
          adorn the door.  She looks at them with a sigh, then ties 
          her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut 
          off her air supply.
          
          Michael walks up.
          
                                 MICHAEL

                    Yeah.  I guess.

                    Oh yeah.
          
          She looks at him suspiciously
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who could refrain that had a heart to 
                    love and in that heart, courage to make 
                    ' B love known?
          
          Michael thinks for a minute.

                    Right.

                    I'm taking care of it.
          
          Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps 
          lips firmly shut.
          
          INT. BOOK STORE - DAY
          
          Kat browses through the feminist lit section
          Patrick appears, through a hole in the books.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine 
                    Mystique?  I lost my copy.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (frowning)
                    What are you doing here?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I heard there was a poetry reading.
          
                                 KAT
                    You 're so --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Pleasant?
          
          Kat stares at him, deadpan.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Wholesome.
          
                                 KAT
                    Unwelcome.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has 
                    her panties in a twist.
          
                                 KAT
                    Don't for one minute think that you had 
                    any effect whatsoever on my panties.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what did I have an effect on ?
          
                                 KAT
                    Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
          
          She pushes past him and heads out the' door
          Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand:  
          Taming of the Shrew.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Cameron  and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into 
          mouth.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You were right. She's still pissed.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Sweet love, renew thy force!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. 
                    People can hear you.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (exasperated)
                    You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice  
                    yourself on the altar of dignity and  
                    even the score.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Best case scenario, you're back on the 
                    payroll for awhile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's the worst?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You get the girl.
          
          Patrick  thinks for a minute
          
                                 PATRICK
                    If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz 
          Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.
          
          From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. 
          Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
          
          The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".  Being sung by Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    "This morning, I woke up with this 
                    feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, 
                    and so I just decided to myself--"
          
          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands 
          beneath the window, crooning.
          
          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and 
          doing backup vocal s.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    "I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk 
                    about it.  And didn't I go and shout it 
                    when you walked into the room --"
          
          He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
          
          IN THE CLASSROOM
          
          Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. 
          Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big 
          finale.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    " I think I love you I "
          
          INSIDE
          
          The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, 
          mortified, but with a slight smile
          
          INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling 
          over their misfortune.
          
                                 MISCREANT 
                    Nice song, Verona.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Flog me.
          
          He makes the appropriate hand gesture
          
          Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, 
          ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
          
                                 KAT (0. S.)
                    Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
          
          Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat 
          standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little.
          
          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He 
          turns fully to face her.
          
                                 KAT
                    Sir, I'd like to state for the record 
                    that Mr. Verona ' s current 
                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never 
                    filed a complaint.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You didn't have to.  He disrupted a 
                    classroom.
          
          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the 
          window.
          
          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.
          
          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."
          
          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window.
          
          The other miscreants watch with glee.
          
                                 KAT
                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.
          
          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy 
          about it, considering they're on the second floor.
          
          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. 
                    Rules stick.
          
          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something 
                    I've always wanted to show you.
          
          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.
          
          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make 
          the jump.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    These.
          
          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
          
          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the 
          flash of skin.
          
          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.  
                    But if I catch you doing that again, 
                    you'll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys.
          
          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without 
          noticing Patrick's absence.
          
          Kat smiles at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
          
          Kat bolts out the door.  Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle 
          mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN
          
          Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing 
          no one.
          
                                 KAT
                    He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he 
                    cruised on me.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    Look up, sunshine
          
          She does.  He's still in the tree
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I guess I never told you I'm afraid of 
                    heights.
          
                                 KAT
                           (smiling)
                    C'mon.  It's not that bad
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Try lookin' at it from this angle
          
          She assesses the branch structure
          
                                 KAT
                    Put your right foot there --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
          
                                 KAT
                    You want me to climb up and show you 
                    how to get down?
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (voice trembling)
                    Maybe.
          
          She sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she 
          perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her.
          
          Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a 
          monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been 
          duped.
          
                                 KAT
                    You shit!
          
          She climbs down after him
          
          EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY 
          
          Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
          
                                 KAT
                    The Partridge Family?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I figured it had to be something 
                    ridiculous to win your respect.  And 
                    piss you off.
          
                                 KAT
                    Good call.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So how'd you get Chapin to look the 
                    other way?
          
                                 KAT
                    I dazzled him with my wit
          
          She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at 
          giggling hyenas and wails on it.  The barker hands her a 
          stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID 
          next to her and they continue walking.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    A soft side? Who knew?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, well, don't let it get out
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what's your excuse?
          
                                 KAT
                    Acting the way we do.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yes
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't like to do what people expect.  
                    Then they expect it all the time and 
                    they get disappointed when you change.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So if you disappoint them from the 
                    start, you're covered?
          
                                 KAT
                    Something like that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then you screwed up
          
                                 KAT
                    How?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You never disappointed me.
          
          She blushes under his gaze
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You up for it?
          
                                 KAT
                    For. . . ?
          
          He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins 
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          
          The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, 
          stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
          
          Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
          Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
          
          Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of 
          her face.
          
          Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
          shots, they're both covered in paint
          
          She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
          empty.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Damn it!
          
          Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.  They land, 
          laughing.
          
          It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
          are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
          find each other's eyes.
          
          He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he 
          goes to kiss her.

          His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has 
          turned into a passionate kiss
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway.  Their paint wardrobe 
          has dried by now and they look like refugees from some 
          strange, yet colorful, war.
          
                                 KAT
                    State trooper?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fallacy.
          
                                 KAT
                    The duck?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hearsay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know the porn career's a lie.
          
          He shuts off the car and turns to her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do you?
          
          He kisses her neck.  It tickles.  She laughs.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tell me something true.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I hate peas.
          
                                 KAT
                    No -- something real.  Something no one 
                    else knows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (in-between kisses)
                    You're sweet.  And sexy.  And 
                    completely hot for me.
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No one else knows
          
                                 KAT
                    You're amazingly self-assured. Has 
                    anyone ever told you that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Go to the prom with me
          
          Kat's smile disappears.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that a request or a command?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know what I mean
          
                                 KAT
                    No.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No what?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, I won't go with you
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Why not?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because I don't want to. It's a stupid 
                    tradition.
          
          Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he 
          being paid to take her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    People won't expect you to go...
          
          Kat turns to him, getting angry.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                                 KAT
                    All of it -- what's in it for you?
          
          He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her 
          suspicions.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Create a little drama?  Start a new 
                    rumor?  What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So I have to have a motive to be with 
                    you?
          
                                 KAT
                    You tell me.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told 
                    you that?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (quietly)
                    Answer the question, Patrick
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (angry)
                    Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me.  
                    Just the pleasure of your company.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.  She breaks it in half before she 
          SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
          
          Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front 
          door and watches him go
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
          
          He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who 
          has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
          
          Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey 
          gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    cover that up
          
          The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face 
          Bianca TAPS on the open door.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Quick question -- are you going to the 
                    prom?
          
          Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM

          Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby.  She 
          fingers a strand of her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Then Guillermo says, "If you go any 
                    lighter, you're gonna look like an extra 
                    on 90210."
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No...
          
          Bianca stares at him for a moment.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    do you listen to this crap?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What crap?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm 
                    like, boring myself.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thank God!  If I had to hear one more 
                    story about your coiffure...
          
          He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and 
          smacks his hand away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    I figured you'd get to the good stuff 
                    eventually.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What good stuff?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The "real you".
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like my fear of wearing pastels?
          
          He looks stricken.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I'm kidding. 
                           (beat)
                    You know how sometimes you just become 
                    this "persona"?  And you don't know how 
                    to quit?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (matter of fact)
                    No
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how 
                    to lie.

          Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.  Finally, it 
          opens.
          
          Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th 
          Century.  Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
          
          INSERT - "0 FAIR ONE.  JOIN ME AT THE PROM.  I WILL BE 
          WAITING.  LOVE, WILLIAM S."
          
          Mandella's agog.  Trevor walks by and sees her holding the 
          dress.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're gonna look splendiferous in 
                    that, Mandella.
          
          Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                           (continuing)
                    that's cool to say.

          Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike
          
                                 SHARON
                    Would you rather be ravished by a 
                    pirate or a British rear admiral?

                    Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with 
                    you. It's tomorrow night --
          
                                 WALTER
                    The prom?  Kat has a date?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, but
          
                                 WALTER
                    It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s 
                    who you want me to bend my rules for?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that 
                    is.
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're not going unless your sister 
                    goes.  End of story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my 
                    own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a 
                    possession!
          
          Bianca storms out.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (calling out)
                    You know what happens at proms?
          
          Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
          
                                 SHARON
                    They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll 
                    come home.  Let her go.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Kissing?  Is that what you think 
                    happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up 
                    to my elbows in placenta all day.
          
          INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca lies on her bed.  MTV blares.  A KNOCK sounds.
          
          BIANCA
          Come in.
          
          Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (kindly)
                    Listen, I know you hate having to sit 
                    home because I'm not Susie High School.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like you care.
          
                                 KAT
                    I do care. But I'm a firm believer in 
                    doing something for your own reasons, 
                    not someone else ' s .
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only 
                    sophomore that got asked to the prom and 
                    I can't go, because you won ' t.
          
          Kat clears her throat
          
                                 KAT
                    Joey never told you we went out, did 
                    he?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    In 9th.  For a month
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (confused)
                    Why?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (self-mocking)
                    He was, like, a total babe
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But you hate Joey
          
                                 KAT
                    Now I do.  Back then, was a different 
                    story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    As in...
          
          Kat takes a deep breath.
          
                                 KAT
                    He said everyone was doing it.  So I 
                    did it.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did what?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing on)
                    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I 
                    didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.  
                    He got pissed.  Then he broke up with 
                    me.
          
          Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 KAT
                    After that, I swore I'd never do 
                    anything just because "everyone else" 
                    was doing it.  And I haven't since. 
                    Except for Bogey's party, and my 
                    stunning gastro-intestinal display --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (stunned)
                    Why didn't you tell me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I wanted to let you make up your own 
                    mind about him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No. you didn't!  If you really thought 
                    I could make my own decisions, you 
                    would've let me go out with him instead 
                    of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
          
          Kat stands up slowly
          
                                 KAT
                    That's not
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'm not stupid enough to repeat your 
                    mistakes.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I thought I was protecting you.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    God, you're just like him! Just keep me 
                    locked away in the dark, so I can't 
                    experience anything for myself
          
                                 KAT
                    Not all experiences are good, Bianca. 
                    You can't always trust the people you 
                    want to.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I guess I'll never know, will I?
          
          She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it 
          behind her.
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
          
          A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  She rolls over and 
          picks up the phone.
          
          BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while 
          watching "I Love Lucy" reruns.
          
          A KNOCK sounds
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Come in.
          
          Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
          
                                 KAT
                    Feel like shopping?
          
          Bianca looks up, hopefully.
          
          LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.  Walter 
          has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What do you wanna watch?  We've got 
                    crap, crap, crap or crap
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Dr. Ruth?
          
          Bianca walks into the living room.  She's wearing a prom 
          dress.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi, Mommy.
                           (looking away)
                                 WALTER
          
          Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca 
          to Sharon.
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Honey, you look beautiful!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You like?  My date should be here in 
                    five.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm missing something.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a 
                    captain of oppression like some men we 
                    know.
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS.  Bianca runs to open it.  There stands 
          CAMERON.  He takes in Bianca's outfit.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Wow
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let's go.
          
          Walter rises.  Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
          
                                 SHARON 
                           (to Bianca)
                    Have a great time, honey!
          
                                 WALTER
                    But -- who -- what --?
          
          The door SLAMS.  As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a 
          blur rushes down the stairs and out the door.  The blur has 
          Kat ' s voice.
          
                                 KAT
                    Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See 
                    you in a few.
          
          The door SLAMS again.  Walter and Sharon 'are alone
          
                                 WALTER
                    What just happened?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Your daughters went to the prom.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Did I have anything to say about it?
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Absolutely not.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That ' s what I thought
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on 
          the porch, wearing a tux.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    I'm here to pick up Bianca.
          
                                 WALTER
                    late
          
          He SLAMS the door shut
          
          EXT  HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
          
          Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice 
          gown.
          
          Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.  In a tux.
          
                                 KAT
                    How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted.  
                    Where'd you get the dress?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just something I had.  You know
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Oh huh
          
                                 KAT
                    Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I 
                    questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
          
          Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No prob.
          
          He remains seated.  Kat fidgets nervously.
          
                                 KAT
                    are you ready?
          
          He rises and stares at her, taking in her image 
          appreciatively.  She blushes and turns away.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    C'mon.  Let's get this over with.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.  Patrick 
          and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Quite the ostentatious display
          
          A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Look, Clem even wore his good boots
          
          Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and 
          Bianca dancing cheek to cheek.  She smiles.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, 
          hair piled on top of her head.  She spots Kat and hurries 
          over.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Have you seen him?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William - he asked me to meet him here.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' 
                    progressed to full-on hallucinations.
          
          Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.  She turns and 
          points Mandella the same way.
          
          Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on 
          his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella's grin couldn't 
          be bigger.
          
          Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand 
          and leading her onto the dance floor.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Mi' lady.
          
                           (to Patrick)
                    Good sir.
          
          Patrick rolls his eyes.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT - LATER
          
          Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG.  Whatever he's 
          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.
          
          Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She 
          whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room
          
          INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a

                                 BIANCA
                           (surprised)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    You think you ' re the only sophomore 
                    at the prom?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I did.
          
          Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    And just so you know, my date isn't 
                    planning on spending most of the night 
                    in his backseat.
          
          BIANCA What're you talking about?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - 
                    your cherry. He practically made a 
                    public announcement.
          
          Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity  tries to backpedal.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (continuing)
                    I wanted to tell you
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few 
          stray jocks - also dateless.  He zeroes in on Cameron, now 
          consoling a pissed-off Bianca.
          
          Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the 
          evil about to erupt.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    My grandmother's .
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    That's where I was last year.  She'd 
                    never lived alone -- my grandfather died 
                    -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, 
                    I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've 
                    never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent 
                    a year sitting next to my grandma on the 
                    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of 
                    story.
          
          He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat 
          stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh
          
                                 KAT
                    That ' s completely adorable!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It gets worse -- you still have your 
                    freshman yearbook?
          
          He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's Bianca doing here with that 
                    cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let 
                    some little punk ass snake me.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to 
          Cameron and Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Feces hitting fan.  C'mon
          
          Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca 
          staring after them.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt 
          Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this 
          situation.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it 
                    easy.
          
          Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.
          
          JOEY You two are in big trouble
          
          Cameron faces Joey.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.
          
          Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise 
          Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
          
          The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon 
          surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White 
          Rastas.
          
                                 DEREK 
                    Very uncool, my brother
          
                                 JOEY
                    I'm not your brother, white boy.
          
          The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that 
          they're white.
          
          Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Just so you know -- she'll only spread 
                    her legs once.
          
          Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing. 
          Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. 
          It's Bianca.  And she BELTS the hell out of him
          
                                 BIANCA
                    That's for making my date bleed
          
          She BELTS him again
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    That's for my sister.
          
          And AGAIN
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    And that's for me.
          
          Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.
          
                                 COWBOY
                    And that's for the fourth grade, 
                    asshole.
          
          HOTEL - NIGHT 
          
          KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Wait I...
          
                                 KAT
                    You were paid to take me out!  By -- 
                    the one person I truly hate.  I knew it 
                    was a set-up!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It wasn't like that.
          
                                 KAT
                    Really?  What was it like?  A down 
                    payment now, then a bonus for sleeping 
                    with me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I didn't care about the money.
          
          He catches up to her now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I cared about --
          
          She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than 
          in anger.
          
                                 KAT
                    You are so not what I thought you were.
          
          He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, 
          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.
          
          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She's 
          never looked more guilty.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a 
          blanket, watching "Sixteen Candles".  When Molly Ringwald 
          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream 
          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an 
          infomercial
          
          The phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes 
          in, bearing a cup of tea.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Are you sure you don't want to come 
                    with us?  It'll be fun.
          
          Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
          
                                 KAT
                    I ' m sure .
          
          Bianca sits down next to her
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You looked beautiful last night, you 
                    know.
          
                                 KAT
                    So did you
          
          Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL 
          rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his 
          head inside.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She okay?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I hope so.
          
          The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Was that your sister?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big 
                    ones.  Full of sperm.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Funny.
          
          Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the 
          infomercial with Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I don't understand the allure of 
                    dehydrated food.  Is this something I 
                    should be hip to?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, Daddy.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (dreading the 
                           answer)
                    So tell me about this dance. Was it 
                    fun?
          
                                 KAT
                    Parts of it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Which parts?
          
                                 KAT
                    The part where Bianca beat the hell out 
                    of some guy.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Bianca did what?
          
                                 KAT
                    What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed 
                    off on her?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No -- impressed.
          
          Kat looks up in surprise.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    You know, fathers don't like to admit 
                    that their daughters are capable of 
                    running their own lives.  It means we've 
                    become spectators.  Bianca still lets me 
                    play a few innings.  You've had me on 
                    the bleachers for years.  When you go to 
                    Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to 
                    watch the game.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (hopeful)
                    When I go?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've 
                    changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a 
                    check.
          
          Kat reaches over and gives him a hug
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes 
          from the food line.

                    Katarina?
          
          She turns and looks at him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'd like to express my apologies.
          
                                 KAT
                    For what?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    I didn't mean for you to get -- When 
                    Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, 
                    I had no idea it would turn out so -- 
                    ugly. I would never have  done anything 
                    to compromise your - - -
          
          He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray 
          against the wall and marched off -- the old "kill, kill" 
          look back in her eyes.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY

          CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open 
          book in hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Who can tell me at what point Lucentio 
                    admits his deception?
          
          The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks 
          in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward 
          the hallway.
          
                                 KAT

          Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair 
          between two rows of lockers.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let go!
          
                                 KAT
                    You set me up.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I just wanted --
          
                                 KAT
                    What? To completely damage me?  To send 
                    me to therapy forever? What?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No! I just wanted
          
          Miss Perky walks up
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my 
                    office?
          
          INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, 
          then focuses on Bianca.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    So you're the real bitch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch.  
                    I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I 
                    could.  Apparently, this makes me a 
                    horrible person.  I'm sorry.
          
          She turns to Kat.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I swear -- I didn't know about the 
                    money.  I didn't even know Joey was 
                    involved.  I would never intentionally 
                    hurt you, Kat.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Kat)
                    Do you care to respond?
          
                                 KAT
                    Am I supposed to feel better? Like, 
                    right now?  Or do I have some time to 
                    think about it?
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    Just smack her now.
          
          Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (to Miss Perky)
                    We'll be getting back to you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    What, no hug?
          
          HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or 
                    is it just me?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just you.

          Mrs. Blaise faces the class
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    All right.  I'm assuming everyone found 
                    time to compose, their poems. Except for 
                    Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.
          
          Nerds in the back high-five each other.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
          
          No one moves.  Then Kat slowly stands up.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'11 go
          
          Patrick looks up.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Oh, Lord.
          
          She downs a couple Prozac
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Please proceed.
          
          Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath 
          before reading from her notebook.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate the way you talk to me/ and the 
                    way you cut your hair/ I hate the way 
                    you drive my car/ I hate it when you 
                    stare.
          
          She pauses, then continues
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and 
                    the way you read my mind/ I hate you so 
                    much it makes me sick/ it even makes me 
                    rhyme.
          
          She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who 
          stares at the floor.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate the way you're always right/ I 
                    hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you 
                    make me laugh/ even worse when you make 
                    me cry/ I hate it that you're not 
                    around/ and the fact that you didn't 
                    call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ' 
                    t hate you/ not even close, not even a 
                    little bit, not even any at all.
          
          She looks directly at Patrick.  He looks back this time.  
          The look they exchange says everything.
          
          Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains 
          in stunned silence.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's 
          greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the 
          front seat.
          
          She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins 
          around.
          
          Patrick stands there, smiling.
          
                                 KAT
                    A Fender Strat. You bought this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you could use it. When you 
                    start your band.
          
          She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Besides, I had some extra cash. Some 
                    asshole paid me to take out a really 
                    great girl.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that right?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for 
                    her.
          
          Blushes and looks down.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You know -- it's not every day you find 
                    a girl who'll flash her tits to get you 
                    out of detention.
          
          Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
          
          He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does 
          She lets him this time.
          
          Then breaks it off
          
                                 KAT
                    You can't just buy me a guitar every 
                    time you screw up, you know.
          
          He grimaces.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know
          
          He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
          
                                 KAT
                    And don't just think you can
          
          He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.

                                 KAT
                    Why is my veggie burger the only burnt 
                    object on this grill?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because I like to torture you.

                    Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman 
                    yearbook?

          ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.

          ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
          
          Severely making-out in a lawn chair.  She comes up for a 
          breath.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    I can't remember a word of Shakespeare

          Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND 
          PATRICK
          
          She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca 
          now hands her.
          
                                 KAT

          Flips to a page.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'd like to call your attention to 
                    Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look 
                    of 1995 ---
          
          INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses, 
          bad hair, headgear -- the works.
          
          She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes 
          and throws a handful of pretzels at her.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Patrick -- is that- a.

          Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --  as we 
          CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge

          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
          
          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
          
          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
          
          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
          
                                 RIDER
                    Hey -- sorry.
          
          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
          
                                 KAT
                    Leave it 
          
          He persists.
          
                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
          
          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.
          
          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
          
          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Did you change your hair?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    No.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You might wanna think about it
          
          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
          
          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
          
                                 BOY
                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Awesome shoes.
          
          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.
          
          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
          
          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I don't think so, ma'am
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.
          
          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
          
          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
          
          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I missed you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    With the teeth of your zipper?
          
          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You the new guy?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So they tell me...
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the 
                    tour.
          
          They head out of the office
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    So -- which Dakota you from?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    North, actually.  How'd you   ?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I was kidding. People actually live 
                    there?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by 
                    the cows, though.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    How many people were in your old 
                    school?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thirty-two.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Get out!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    How many people go here?
          
                                 MICHAEL

          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through 
          the crowd as he points to various cliques.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    We've got your basic beautiful people. 
                    Unless they talk to you first, don't 
                    bother.
          
          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader 
          splendor.
          
                                 MICHAEL

                    Those 're your cowboys.
          
          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys  
          walk by.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That I'm used to.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.
          
          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled 
          around it.

          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets 
          lounge on the grass.  A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them

                    lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I 
                    mean.
          
          Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.

          Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the

          Loud music and loud students.  Michael sits with a group of

          Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO

          without a look.

                    I could start with your haircut, but it 
                    doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to 
                    date until her older sister does.  And 
                    that's an impossibility.

          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space 
          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English 
          Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that 
                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man 
                    and the Sea.  Any other comments?

          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes 
          off her glasses and speaks up.

                    This book is about a guy and his 
                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial

                    Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.

                    hag who has no friends?
          
          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
          
          Really gets fired up now
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess the school board thinks because 
                    Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's 
                    worthy of our time

                    Expressing my opinion is not a

                    Well, yes, compared to your other 
                    choices of expression this year, today's 
                    events are quite mild.  By the way, 
                    Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation 
                    went quite well, in case you're

                    I still maintain that he kicked himself 
                    in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.

                    term used most often.
          
          She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    You might want to work on that
          
          Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the 
          counselor's.
          
                                 KAT
                    As always, thank you for your excellent 
                    guidance.
          
          INT. SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in 
          big flowing handwriting.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                    I realize the language of Mr. 
                    Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, 
                    but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
          
          Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip 
          of her hair to CHASTITY.  Chastity opens the note and reads:
          
          INSERT - "JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY  
          GOD!"
          
          Chastity frowns to herself.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                           (continuing)
                    Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment 
                    on what you've read so far?
          
          Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Not really.
          
          The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
          
          MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side 
          trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her 
          notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Mandella -- since you're assisting us, 
                    you might as well comment.  I'm assuming 
                    you read the assignment.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Uh, yeah, I read it all
          
                                 TEACHER
                    The whole play^
          
                                 MANDELIA
                    The whole folio.  All the plays.
          
                                 TEACHER
                           (disbelieving)
                    You've read every play by William 
                    Shakespeare?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Haven't you?
          
          She raises a challenging eyebrow.  The stunned teacher 
          doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are 
          eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
          
                                 MANDELLA
          
          Your sister is so amazingly without.  She'll never read him.  
          She has no idea.
          
          Kat attacks
          
                                 KAT
                    The fact that you're cutting gym so you 
                    can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear 
                    his name, is a little without in itself 
                    if you ask me.
          
          Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his 
          friends, lighting up a cigarette.  Mandella notices her 
          staring.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who's that?
          
                                 KAT
                    Patrick Verona   Random skid.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone 
                    for a year? I heard he was doing porn 
                    movies.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm sure he's completely incapable of 
                    doing anything that interesting.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    He always look so
          
                                 KAT
                    Block E?
          
          Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into 
          Mandella's hand.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a 
                    very slow way to die.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Just a little.
          
          She eats.  Kat sees her wrist
          
                                 KAT
                    What's this?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    An attempted slit.
          
          Kat stares at her, expressionless.
          
                                 KAT
                    I realize that the men of this fine 
                    institution are severely lacking, but 
                    killing yourself so you can be with 
                    William Shakespeare is beyond the scope 
                    of normal teenage obsessions.  You're 
                    venturing far past daytime talk show 
                    fodder and entering the world of those 
                    who need very expensive therapy.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    But imagine the things he'd say during 
                    sex.
          
          Thinks a minute
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, say you do it.  You kill 
                    yourself, you end up in wherever you end 
                    up and he's there.  Do you really think 
                    he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound 
                    compulsive who failed volleyball?
          
          Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
          
          ACROSS THE COURTYARD
          
          As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS   One of 
          the cohorts elbows Joey.
          
                                 COHORT
                    Virgin alert.
          
          Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' good, ladies.
          
          Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Tragic.
          
          Doesn't respond
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from 
          their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can 
          of beans linger on the grass behind them.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why do girls like that always like guys 
                    like that?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Because they're bred to.  Their mothers 
                    liked guys like that, and their 
                    grandmothers before them. Their gene 
                    pool is rarely diluted.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He always have that shit-eating grin?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish 
                    I could say he's a moron, but he's 
                    number twelve in the class.  And a 
                    model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's 
                    rumored to have a big tube sock ad 
                    coming out.
          
          The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their 
          empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries 
          to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    You know French?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You mean I'd get a chance to talk to 
                    her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You could consecrate with her, my 
                    friend.
          
          Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.  Joey pulls up 
          beside her in his Viper.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (re her dress)
                    The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't 
                    you been reading your Sassy?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, and I noticed the only part of 
                    you featured in your big Kmart spread 
                    was your elbow.  Tough break.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (practically 
                           spitting)
                    They're running the rest of me next 
                    month.
          
          He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.  
          Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in 
          a convertible.
          
                                 KAT
                    The people at this school are so 
                    incredibly foul.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You could always go with me.  I'm sure 
                    William has some friends.
          
          They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and 
          Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
          
                                 JOEY
                    Need a ride, ladies?
          
          Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.  He 
          pulls away with a smile.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
          
          Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's a charming new development
          
          Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the 
          tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
          
          As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his 
          moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
          
                                 KAT
                           (yelling)
                    Remove head from sphincter!  Then 
                    pedal!
          
          Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry 
          at the delay.
          
          Cameron rushes over
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You all right?
          
          He slows to a stop
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, just a minor encounter with the 
                    shrew.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's her?  Bianca's sister?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
          
          Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's 
          grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint 
          jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
          - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of 
          her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds 
          several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. 
          
          Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she 
          types.
          
                                 KAT
                    "Undulating with desire, Adrienne 
                    removes her crimson cape, revealing her 
                    creamy --"
          
          WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type 
          obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a 
          doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
          
          I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before 
          Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.
          
          He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to 
          kiss Sharon on the cheek.
          
                                 SHARON
                    In the microwave.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Kat)
                    Make anyone cry today?
          
                                 KAT
                    Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.
          
          Bianca walks in.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Where've you been?
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (eyeing Walter)
                    Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
          
          She kisses him on the cheek
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hello, precious.
          
          Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs
          
                                 KAT
                    How touching.
          
          Walter holds up a letter to Kat
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?
          
          Snatches it away from him.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I got in
          
          Sharon looks up from her computer.
          
                                 SHARON
                    What's a synonym for throbbing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of 
                    the country.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I thought we decided you were going to 
                    school here.  At U of 0.
          
                                 KAT
                    You decided.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is there even a question that we want 
                    her to stay?
          
          Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at
          
                                 KAT
                    Ask Bianca who drove her home
          
                                 SHARON
                    Swollen...turgid.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca; upset)
                    Who drove you home?
          
          Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's 
                    this boy... and I think he might ask...
          
                                 WALTER
                    No! You're not dating until your sister 
                    starts dating.  End of discussion.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What if she never starts dating?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Then neither will you.  And I'll get to 
                    sleep at night.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, 
                    Daddy!
          
                                 KAT
                    This from someone whose diary is 
                    devoted to favorite grooming tips?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Enough!
          
          He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Do you know what this is?
          
          He hits the "play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from 
          the tape recorder.
          
          BIANCA AND WALTER
                           (in unison, by 
                           rote)
                    The sound of a fifteen-year-old in 
                    labor.
          
                                 WALTER
                    This is why you're not dating until 
                    your sister does.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But she doesn't want to date.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Exactly my point
          
          His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich 
                    before you women start dilating?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Tumescent!
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Sharon; as he 
                           leaves)
                    You're not helping.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.  Bianca arrives 
          in a flurry of blonde hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can we make this quick?  Roxanne 
                    Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an 
                    incredibly horrendous public break- up 
                    on the quad.  Again.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, I thought we'd start with 
                    pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
          
          BIANCA
          Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    Okay... then how 'bout we try out some 
                    French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
          
          Bianca smiles slowly
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're asking me out.  That's so cute.  
                    What's your name again?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (embarrassed)
                    Forget it.
          
          Bianca seizes an opportunity.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have 
                    a proper introduction ---
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Cameron.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the 
                    mercy of a particularly hideous breed of 
                    loser.  My sister.  I can't date until 
                    she does.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Seems like she could get a date easy 
                    enough...
          
          She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled.
          
                                 BIANCA
          
          The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be 
                    really popular when she started high 
                    school, then it was just like she got 
                    sick of it or something.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's a shame.
          
          She reaches out and touches his arm
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Gosh, if only we could find Kat a 
                    boyfriend...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Let me see what I can do.
          
          Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
          
          INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
          
          A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.  
          Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You're in school for one day and you 
                    ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you 
                    have no concept of the high school 
                    social code?
          
          Cameron grins away
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I teach her French, get to know her, 
                    dazzle her with charm and she falls in 
                    love with me.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Unlikely, but even so, she still can't 
                    go out with you.  So what's the
                    point?
          
          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab 
          tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles 
          as he tries to revive his frog.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What about him?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (confused)
                    You wanna go out with him?
          
          The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (impatient)
                    No - he could wrangle with the sister.
          
          Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What makes you think he'll do it?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He seems like he thrives on danger
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard 
                    he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just 
                    got out of Alcatraz...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They always let felons sit in on Honors 
                    Biology?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He 
                    sold his own liver on the black market 
                    so he could buy new speakers.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Forget his reputation.  Do you think 
                    we've got a plan or not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Did she actually say she'd go out with 
                    you?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's what I just said
          
          Michael processes this.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca, 
                    you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.  
                    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I thought you hated those people.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients 
                    when I get to Wall Street.
          
          A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee 
          Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
          
          He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another 
          frog, with full-on sound effects.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'll let you handle that.
          
          INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
          
          Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
          
          Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his 
          jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway.  Inside 
          several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
          
                                 PEPE
                    Some people like the Colombian, but it 
                    all depends on your acidity preference.  
                    Me?  I prefer East African and 
                    Indonesian.  You start the day with a 
                    Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian 
                    Sidamo in your cup, you're that much 
                    farther ahead than someone drinkin' 
                    Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I 
                    mean?
          
          Michael nods solemnly.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that 
          looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
          
          Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hey, there
          
          In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his 
          direction.
          
          Cameron slinks away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Later, then. 
          
          Michael watches, shaking his head.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria 
          tray with a magic marker.
          
          Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Are you lost?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Nope - just came by to chat
          
                                 JOEY
                    We don't chat.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Well, actually, I thought I'd run an 
                    idea by you.  You know, just to see if 
                    you're interested.
          
                                 JOEY
                    We're not.
          
          He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to 
          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (grimacing)
                    Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't 
                    you?
          
          Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    But she can't go out with you because 
                    her sister is this insane head case and 
                    no one will go out with her. right?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Does this conversation have a purpose?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So what you need to do is recruit a guy 
                    who'll go out with her.  Someone who's 
                    up for the job.
          
          Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his 
          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage 
          can, rather than in it.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          That guy?  I heard he ate a live duck once.  Everything but 
          the beak and the feet.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Exactly
          
          Joey turns to look at Michael.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          What's in it for you?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will 
                    on my part.
          
          He rises to leave and turns to the others.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    I have a dick on my face, don't I? 
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork 
          off his face as Cameron watches.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got him involved?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when 
                    you let the enemy think he's 
                    orchestrating the battle, you're in a 
                    position of power. We let him pretend 
                    he's calling the shots, and while he's 
                    busy setting up the plan, you have time 
                    to woo Bianca.
          
          Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You're one brilliant guy
          
          Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
          
                                 MICHAEL
          
          Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but 
          it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who 
          Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. 
          
          Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a 
          manly way for the others, now watching.
          
          INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is 
          smoking.
          
                                 KAT
                    So he has this huge raging fit about 
                    Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to 
                    his male-dominated, puking frat boy, 
                    number one golf team school. I have no 
                    say at all.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William would never have gone to a 
                    state school.
          
                                 KAT
                    William didn't even go to high school
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's never been proven
          
                                 KAT
                    Neither has his heterosexuality.
          
          Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to 
          stub out Mandella's cigarette. 
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    I appreciate your efforts toward a 
                    speedy death, but I'm consuming.
                           (pointing at her 
                           food)
                    Do you mind?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Does it matter?
          
                                 KAT
                    If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any 
                    school you want, precious.  Don't forget 
                    your tiara."
          
          They both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the 
          counter to place his order.
          
          Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Janice Parker told me he was a roadie 
                    for Marilyn Manson.
          
          Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Janice Parker is an idiot
          
          INT.  MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
          
          Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (looking at chart)
                    I don't understand, Patrick.  You 
                    haven't done anything asinine this week.  
                    Are you not feeling well?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Touch of the flu.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm at a loss, then.  What should we 
                    talk about? Your year of absence?
          
          He smiles his charming smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How 'bout your sex life?
          
          She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Why don't we discuss your driving need 
                    to be a hemorrhoid?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What's to discuss?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, 
                    and as far as I can tell, you're only 
                    slightly psychotic -- so why is it that 
                    you're such a fuck-up?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Well, you know -- there's the prestige 
                    of the job title... and the benefits 
                    package is pretty good...
          
          The bell RINGS.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Fine.  Go do something repugnant and 
                    give us something to talk about next 
                    week.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various 
          desks.
          
          Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to 
          get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Look, it's really easy.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, 
                    sister.
          
          Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (rotely)
                    It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not 
                    related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a 
                    political figure.  I do not live in 
                    South Africa.  My parents just spent a 
                    few too many acid trips thinking they 
                    were revolutionaries.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                    But you freed our people
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Your "people" are white, suburban high 
                    school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I 
                    have not freed you, Trevor.
                           (grabbing his arm 
                           dramatically)
                    Only you can free yourself.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as 
          can be
          
                                 BIANCA
                    C'esc ma tete. This is my head
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Right.  See?  You're ready for the 
                    quiz.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I don't want to know how to say that 
                    though.  I want to know useful things.  
                    Like where the good stores are.  How 
                    much does champagne cost?  Stuff like 
                    Chat.  I have never in my life had to 
                    point out my head to someone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's because it's such a nice one.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Forget French.
          
          She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    How is our little Find the Wench A Date 
                    plan progressing?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, there's someone I think might be 
                    --
          
          Bianca's eyes light up
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Show me
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. 
          Bianca plays it cool.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Give me a sign when he walks by.  And 
                    don't point.
          
          The bell RINGS.  Kids flood past.  Then Patrick saunters by 
          with Scurvy.  Cameron nudges Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    There.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where?
          
          Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across 
          Patrick's path.  Patrick shoves him back against the wall 
          without a thought.  Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca's 
          feet.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I guess he didn't see me 
                           (calling after 
                           Patrick) 
                                     Some other time --
          
          Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in  her eye.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    My God, he's repulsive. He's so 
                    perfect!
          
          INT. GYM CLASS - DAY 
          
          Several volleyball games are being played.
          
          Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach 
          Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym 
          clothes.  They pull him aside roughly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (shrugging them 
                           off)
                    What?
          
          Joey points
          
          JOEY See that girl?
          
          Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the 
          ball into some poor cowboy's face.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah
          
                                 JOEY 
                    What do you think?
          
          Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared 
          of her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Two legs, nice rack...
          
                                 JOEY
                    Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out 
                    with her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You just said
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need money to take a girl out
          
                                 JOEY
                    But you'd go out with her if you had 
                    the cake?
          
          Patrick stares at Joey deadpan.  His dislike for the guy 
          obvious.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had 
                    the plane.
          
          Joey smiles.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, 
                    you do the honors.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're gonna pay me to take out some 
                    girl?
          
                                 JOEY
                    I can't date her sister until that one 
                    gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.  
                    She doesn't want a boyfriend.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    How much?
          
                                 JOEY
          
          Twenty bucks each time you take her out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I can't take a girl like that out on 
                    twenty bucks.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Fine, thirty.
          
          Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Take it or leave it.  This isn't a 
                    negotiation.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fifty, and you've got your man.
          
          Patrick walks away with a smile
          
          EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
          
          Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice 
          session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over 
          the field.
          
          Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette 
          dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
          
          MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                           (proudly) 
                    Good run, Stratford.
          
          Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick 
          hops down to follow.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Hey. Girlie.
          
          Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (smiles brightly)
                    Sweating like a pig, actually.  And 
                    yourself?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    There's a way to get a guy's attention.
          
                                 KAT
                    My mission in life.
          
          She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, 
                    you see, it worked.  The world makes 
                    sense again.
          
          Patrick's eyes narrow.  He steps closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Pick you up Friday, then
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, right.  Friday.
          
          PATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone
          
                                 PATRICK
                    The night I take you to places you've 
                    never been before.  And back.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?  
                    Do you even know my name, screwboy?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know a lot more than that
          
          Kat stares at him.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Doubtful.  Very doubtful.
          
          She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (calling after her)
                    You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
          
          Scurvy appears at his side
          
                                 SCURVY
                    So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a 
                    new Blaupunkt.
          
          ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He took the bait.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, 
          and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.
          
          She wacks Bianca away.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you ever considered a new look? I 
                    mean, seriously, you could have some 
                    potential buried under all this 
                    hostility.
          
          Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
          
                                 KAT
                    I have the potential to smack the crap 
                    out of you if you don't get out of my 
                    way.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you at least start wearing a bra?
          
          Kat SLAMS her door in response.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit
          
          SCURVY You up for a burger?
          
          Patrick looks in his wallet.  It's empty.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books.  Patrick 
          appears at her side, smiling.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          Kat doesn't answer
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    You hate me don't you?
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't really think you warrant that 
                    strong an emotion.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at 
                    the track with me.
          
                                 KAT 
                    And why would I do that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, 
                    you with money in your eyes, me with my 
                    hand on your ass...
          
                                 KAT
                    You -- covered in my vomit.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Seven-thirty?
          
          She slams her locker shut and walks away
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in  her 
          teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.  She 
          finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
          
          She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her 
          car
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
          
          Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Are you following me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I was in the laundromat. I saw your 
                    car. Thought I'd say hi.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Hi
          
          She gets in and starts the car.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not a big talker, are you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Depends on the topic. My fenders don't 
                    really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
          
          She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper, 
          which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
          
          Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- do you mind?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Not at all
          
          They continue on into the store.  Kat stares at them in 
          disbelief...
          
          Then BACKS UP
          
          Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious 
          Viper.
          
          Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the 
          liquor store.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing) 
                    You fucking bitch!
          
          Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.  Smiling 
          sweetly.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
          
                                 WALTER
                    My insurance does not cover PMS
          
                                 KAT
                    Then tell them I had a seizure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You 
                    punishing me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I thought you were punishing me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why can't we agree on this?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because you're making decisions for me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    As a parent, that's my right
          
                                 KAT
                    So what I want doesn't matter?
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're eighteen.  You don't know what 
                    you want.  You won't know until you're 
                    forty-five and you don't have it.

                           (emphatic)
                    I want to go to an East Coast school! I 
                    want you to trust me to make my own 
                    choices.  I want --
          
          Walter's BEEPER goes off
          
                                 WALTER
                    Christ!  I want a night to go by that 
                    I'm not staring a contraction in the 
                    face.
          
          He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing 
          Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.
          
                                 JOEY
                    When I shell out fifty, I expect 
                    results.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm on it
          
                                 JOEY
                    Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't 
                    count as a date.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I got her under control. She just acts 
                    crazed in public to keep up the image.
          
          Joey sees through the bluff
          
                                 JOEY
                    Let me put it to you this way, if you 
                    don't get any action, I don't get any 
                    action.  So get your ass on hers by the 
                    end of the week.
          
          Joey starts to walk off
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I just upped my price
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (turning)
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    A hundred bucks a date.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Forget it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget her sister, then.
          
          Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker,  
          then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing 
          scowl.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better hope you're as smooth as you 
                    think you are, Verona.
          
          Patrick takes the money with a smile.

          Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?
          
          Bianca glares at him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    A "copine" is someone you can count on.  
                    An "ami" is someone who makes promises 
                    he can't keep.
          
          Cameron closes the French book
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got something on your mind?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I counted on you to help my cause. You 
                    and that thug are obviously failing.  
                    Aren't we ever going on our date?
          
          He melts
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You have my word.  As a gentleman
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're sweet.
          
          She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches 
          her toss her hair back
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (appreciative)
                    How do you get your hair to look like 
                    that?

                    without the diffuser attachment.
          
          Cameron nods with interest.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You know, I read an article about that.
          
          Bianca looks surprised.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did?

          Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and 
          Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (without turning 
                           around) 
                    Say it
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (clearing his 
                           throat) 
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Whatever the hell it is you're standin' 
                    there waitin' to say.
          
          Cameron bravely steps forward
          
                                 CAMERON
                    We wanted to talk to you about the 
                    plan.
          
          Patrick turns toward them.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What plan?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The situation is, my man Cameron here 
                    has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What is it with this chick?  She have 
                    three tits?
          
          Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I think I speak correctly when I say 
                    that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than 
                    say -- Joey Dorsey's.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm 
                    just in this for the cash.
          
          Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his 
          beloved Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    That's where we can help you.  With 
                    Kat.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    So Dorsey can get the girl?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the 
                    big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set 
                    this whole thing up so Cameron can get 
                    the girl.
          
          Patrick smiles.  He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in 
          this game.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You two are gonna help me tame the wild 
                    beast?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (grinning) 
                    We're your guys.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    And he means that strictly in a non- 
                    prison-movie type of way.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Yeah -- we'll see.
          
          He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and 
          Cameron grinning at each other.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    We're in.

          night bash at his abode.  Casual attire".
          
          Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    This is it.  A golden opportunity. 
                    Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    In that case, we'll need to make it a 
                    school-wide blow out.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Will Bogey get bent?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself 
                    with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

                    Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if 
                    you won't be there.

                    I really, really, really wanna go, but 
                    I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem 
                    to be goin' for him.
          
          He fishes.

                                 BIANCA
                    Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of 
                    Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm 
                    pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex 
                    tendencies.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So that's the kind of guy she likes? 
                    Pretty ones?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say 
                    is that she'd dip before dating a guy 
                    that smokes.
          
          Cameron furiously takes notes
          
                                 CAMERON
                    All right.  What else is she partial 
                    to?
          
          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 
          Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.
          
          He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the 
          bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.
          
          Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our 
          two non-deviants pass through.
          
          Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    What've you got for me?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I've retrieved certain pieces of 
                    information on Miss Katarina Stratford I 
                    think you'll find helpful.
          
          Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Patrick)
          
          One question before we start -- should you be drinking 
          alcohol when you don't have a liver?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?!
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Good enough.
          
          Cameron looks up at Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Number one.  She hates smokers
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    It's a lung cancer issue
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Her favorite uncle
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Dead at forty-one.
          
          Patrick sits up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Are you telling me I'm a - 
                           (spits the word 
                           out)
                    "non-smoker"?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Just for now.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat 
                    likes -- pretty guys.
          
          This is met with silence.  Then:
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?  You don't think I'm pretty?
          
          Michael smacks Cameron
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He's pretty!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Okay!  I wasn't sure
          
          Cameron goes back to the list.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist 
                    prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of 
                    the indie-rock persuasion".
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what does that give me?  I'm 
                    supposed to buy her some noodles and a 
                    book and sit around listening to chicks 
                    who can't play their instruments?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Ever been to Club Skunk?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow 
                    night.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Don't make me do it, man
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Assail your ears for one night.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's her favorite band.
          
          Patrick groans
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I also retrieved a list of her most 
                    recent CD purchases, courtesy of 
                    American Express.
          
          He hands it over.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Michael -- did you get this information 
                    "illegally"?
          
          Michael puts a finger to his lips.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I prefer to think of it simply as an 
                    alternative to what the law allows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm likin' you guys better
          
          He looks down at the list of CDs.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    This is really music?
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with 
          indie rock band posters and flyers.
          
          Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up 
          Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you turn down the Screaming 
                    Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.
          
          Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning 
          down the volume.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Don't tell me you're actually going 
                    out?  On a school night, no less.
          
          Kat shoots her a glare
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing; 
                           excited)
                    Oh my God, does this mean you're 
                    becoming normal?
          
                                 KAT
                    It means that Gigglepuss is playing at 
                    Club Skunk and we're going.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (disappointed)
                    Oh, I thought you might have a date
                           (beat)
                    I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, 
                    but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party Saturday night?
          
                                 KAT
                    What do you think?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I think you're a freak.  I think you do 
                    this to torture me.  And I think you 
                    suck.
          
          She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her.   Kat 
          doesn't bat an eye.  She grabs her purse and opens the door
          
                                 KAT 
                    Let's hit it.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the 
          line of kids below.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her 
          fake ID.  The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically 
          mono-syllabic.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (whispering to Kat) 
                    You think this'll work?
          
                                 KAT 
                    No fear.
          
          They approach Bruce.  Kat puts on her happy, shiny face
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!
          
          Bruce looks the girls up and down.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    I can count.
          
          He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, 
          wearing a face that could only be described as "I AM a 
          Victoria's Secret model."
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    I'll bet you can..
          
          She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.  Bruce stares 
          at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Go ahead.
                           (to Mandella)
                    And you
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (all come hither)
                    Yes?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Take it easy on the guys in there.
          
          Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows 
          behind, shaking her head.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked 
          PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the 
          boy's inside pocket.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Next time, leave the Bic at home, 
                    Skippy.
          
                                 SKIPPY
                    It's a bottle opener.
          
          Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Verona, my man.
          
          They shake.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Always a pleasure, Brucie.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss 
                    fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen 
                    belly-button ring for you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of 
                    minors come in?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Never
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. 
                    The other one kinda short and 
                    undersexed?
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Just sent 'em through.
          
          Patrick starts to go in
          
                                 BRUCE 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- what happened to that chick you 
                    brought last time?  The one with the 
                    snake?
          
          Patrick laughs and goes into the club
          
          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their 
          bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.
          
          Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss 
          finishes a song.
          
                                 LEAD SINGER
                    Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and 
                    we're from Olympia.
          
          A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to 
          scream.
          
                                 BOY (0.S.)
                    Pet my kitty!
          
                                 LEAD SINGER 
                    Meow
          
          They rev into their next song. 
          
          NEAR THE STAGE  
          
          Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the 
          opening chords of the song, they look at each other and 
          scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be 
          having a better time.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks 
          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and 
          Mandella singing along.
          
          HIS POV
          
          The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. 
          None of her usual "attitude".  Patrick is transfixed.  And 
          most definitely attracted.
          
          NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (shouting)
                    I need agua!
          
          She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR
          
          She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's 
          waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing to 
                           herself) 
                    Shit
          
          She sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks 
          away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed.
          
          The bartender arrives
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (shouting) 
                    What can I get you?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Two waters.
          
          She looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the 
          band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she 
          marches off, forgetting to pay.
          
          She walks up to Patrick.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing) 
                    You're not fooling anyone.
          
          Patrick looks at her, surprised
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    hey.  Great show, huh?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
          
          If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it 
          over with.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    Excuse me?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    That's what you want, isn't it?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling; gesturing 
                           toward the band)
                    Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it 
                    for me.
          
          Kat steams.  And watches him watch the band
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    You're not surrounded by your usual 
                    cloud of smoke.
          
          The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know.  I quit.
          
          He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.  She moves 
          closer.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Oh, really?
          
          He motions toward the stage
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill 
                    or The Raincoats, but they're right up 
                    there.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know who The Raincoats are?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Why, don't you?
          
          She's completely taken aback.  He uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I watched you out there   I've never 
                    seen you look like that
          
          Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          Her cheeks pinken.
          
          His cocky side is back in a flash
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    Come to that party with me.
          
          At that moment, the band starts another SONG
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling) 
                    What?
          
          The bartender approaches.
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (to Kat, yelling) 
                    You forgot to pay!
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    I got it, Rick.
          
          He tosses some bills on the bar
          
          Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to 
          figure out his motive.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing; 
                           yelling) 
                    Nine-thirty then.
          
          A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she 
          can't hear a word he's saying.  She gives him one last look 
          and heads back into the crowd.
          
          Patrick smiles.  She didn't say no this time.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst 
          them.  A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick 
          coasts by in his truck.  The gears GRIND.  He yells out the 
          window.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    What'd he say?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Who cares?
          
          Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Has he importun'd you with love in 
                    honourable fashion?
          
          Kat glances sharply at her.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (continuing; off 
                           her look)
                    Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor 
                    of romance.  You're the one that wants 
                    to march on Washington every five 
                    minutes.
          
          Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Gigglepuss was so beyond.
          
          Mandella nods.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    They were.  I only wish William could 
                    have been here to witness the rebirth of 
                    punk rock with us.
          
          Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the 
          car.
          
                                 KAT
                    So true.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So, then she says that she almost 
                    didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that 
                    dress because she thought she was 
                    mixing, you know, genres. And the fact 
                    that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -
                    "really meant something."
          
          Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    You told me that part already.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hell, I've just been going over the 
                    whole thing in my head and -
          
          Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder.  
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Hey.  Dingo Boingo
          
          Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around 
          slowly
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing; to 
                           Michael)
                    I hear you're helpin' Verona.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You and Verona?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What?  We took bathes together when we 
                    were kids.
          
          It's incredibly obvious that he's lying.  Joey eyes him then 
          turns to Cameron.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's your gig in all this?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm just the new guy.
          
          Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his 
          shirt and twisting it.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better not fuck this up.  I'm 
                    heavily invested.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- it's all for the higher good 
                    right?
          
          Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker 
          for good measure, as he walks away-
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Is it about me?
          
          EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and 
          annoyed.
          
          The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You're completely demented.
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (cheery)
                    See you next week!
          
          Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
          
          Miss Perky watches in horror
          
          MISS PERKY
          You two know each other?
          
                                 PATRICK/KAT 
                    Yeah/No.
          
          Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Patrick)
                    Dear God, stay away from her.  If you 
                    two ever decided to breed, evil would 
                    truly walk the earth.
          
          Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then 
          smiles-
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          The lights are on, illuminating the yard
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room.  MUSIC is 
          blaring and the door is shut.  Bianca looks at her watch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    She's obviously not going.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak 
          past.  Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.  The girls freeze.
          
          Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich 
          The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I --
          
                                 WALTER
                    And where're you going?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    If you must know, we were attempting to 
                    go to a small study group of friends.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Otherwise known as an orgy?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew 
                    you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria 
                    Steinem" over there isn't going --
          
          She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes 
          downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her 
          relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
          school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen.
          
          Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Do you know about any party? Katarina?
          
          Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an 
          apple
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, people expect me to be there!
          
                                 WALTER
                    If Kat's not going, you're not going.
          
          Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're ruining my life'  Because you 
                    won't be normal, I can't be normal.
          
                                 KAT 
                    What's normal?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but 
                    you're too busy listening to Bitches Who 
                    Need Prozac to know that.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
          
          Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can't you forget for just one night 
                    that you're completely wretched?
          
                                 KAT
                    At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked 
                    hedge-pig.
          
          Bianca tosses her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like I'm supposed to know what that 
                    even means.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard 
                    of him?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's 
                    boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not 
                    allowed to go out, I should obsess over 
                    a dead guy, too.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Girls
          
          Kat stares Bianca down
          
                                 KAT
                    I know about the goddamn party.  I'm 
                    going.
          
          Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst 
          into gleeful screams.
          
          A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, God.  It's starting.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy.
          
          Walter looks dazed.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Wear the belly before you go.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, no!
          
                                 WALTER
                    Just for a minute
          
          He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
          pregnancy belly.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I want you to realize the weight of 
                    your decisions.
          
          He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You are so completely unbalanced.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Can we go now?

                           (to Bianca)
                    Promise me you won't talk to any boys 
                    unless your sister is present.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Why?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Because she'll scare them away.
          
          Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall 
          table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the 
          door and...
          
          There stands Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nine-thirty right?
          
          Kat's in shock
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I'm early.
          
          She holds up her keys
          
                                 KAT 
                    I'm driving.
          
          He peeks in behind her.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Who knocked up your sister?
          
          INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a 
          pro, handing out cigars and martinis.
          
                                 BOGEY
                    Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the 
                    right, shots in the kitchen.
          
          The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat 
          pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and 
          hollering within the jock crowd.
          
          Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey 
          sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the 
          doorway.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
          
          Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his 
          forehead.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline 
                    just recede?
          
          He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's 
          already walking away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Where ya goin?
          
                                 KAT
                    Away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Your sister here?
          
          Kat's face shows utter hatred
          
                                 KAT 
                    Leave my sister alone.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (smirking) 
                    And why would I do that?
          
          A RUCKUS sounds from the next room
          
                                 JOCK 
                    A fight!
          
          The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash 
          their cupfuls on each other.
          
                                 COFFEE KID #1
                    That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you 
                    Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
          
          Caffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to 
          watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into 
          the kitchen.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Just who I was looking for.
          
          He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out
          
                                 KAT 
                                 BIANCA
          
          Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
          
          A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts 
          another.
          
          GUY
          Drink up, sister.
          
          Patrick walks up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's this?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (mocking)
                    "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that 
                    what you're supposed to do at a party?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I say, do what you wanna do.
          
                                 KAT
                    Funny, you're the only one
          
          She downs another.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Cameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his 
          beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and 
          dishes dirt simultaneously.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (high-fiving a 
                           jock)
                    Moose, my man! 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters 
                    have already started calling.
          
          Cameron nods intently
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing; 
                           grabbing his belt)
                    Yo, Clem. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new 
                    Leanne Rimes. 
                           (with a Jamaican 
                           swagger)
                    Ziggy, peace, bra. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Prefers a water pipe, but has been 
                    known to use a bong.
          
          Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, 
          and points Cameron's body in her direction.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Follow the love, man
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where did he go?  He was just here.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Who?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Joey.
          
          Cameron walks over.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Evening, ladies.
          
          Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Looks like things worked out tonight, 
                    huh?
          
          Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You know Chastity?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I believe we share an art instructor
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Great
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Would you mind getting me a drink, 
                    Cameron?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Certainly
                    Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
          
          Bianca gives him a tense smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Surprise me.
          
          He heads for the kitchen.  Joey walks up and grabs her 
          around the waist.
          
          She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just 
          as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and 
          straw -- in his hand.
          
          Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, 
          then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.
          
          Michael appears.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy 
                    just picks up a girl and carries her 
                    away while you're talking to her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're 
                    making progress.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No, I ' m not.
          
          He smacks himself in the head
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    She used me!  She wants to go out with 
                    Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!
          
          Michael pats him on the shoulder.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    At least you're self-aware
          
          BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a 
          drunken group hug singing "I Shot the Sheriff".  Kat has 
          another shot glass in hand.
          
          Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured 
          cheerleader.  He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes 
          then looks away.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer
          
                                 JOEY
                    So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog 
                    thing going -- and the tube sock gig " 
                    that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up 
                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Queen Harry?
          
                                 JOEY
                    It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, 
                    like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
          
          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting 
          difficult.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Neat...
          
                                 JOEY
                    My agent says I've got a good shot at 
                    being the Prada guy next year.
          
          He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.  Bianca 
          takes the opportunity to escape.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'll be right back.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.  Chastity 
          applies lip-gloss in the mirror.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He practically proposed when he found 
                    out we had the same dermatologist. I 
                    mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, 
                    but he's not exactly relevant party 
                    conversation.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Is he oily or dry?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Combination.  I don't know -- I thought 
                    he'd be different.  More of a 
                    gentleman...
          
          Chastity rolls her eyes
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Bianca, I don't think the highlights of 
                    dating Joey Dorsey are going to include 
                    door-opening and coat-holding.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're 
                    supposed to want to go out with are the 
                    ones we actually want to go out with, 
                    you know?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    All I know is -- I'd give up my private 
                    line to go out with a guy like Joey.
          
          There's a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very 
          drunken Kat.
          
                                 KAT
                    Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need 
                    to tell you --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (cutting her off)
                    I really don't think I need any social 
                    advice from you right now.
          
          Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
          
          Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Maybe you should let me have it.
          
          Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go
          
                                 KAT
                    I want another one
          
          Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting 
          him from his task.
          
                                 JOEY
                    My man
          
          As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of 
          dancing people in the dining room.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (annoyed)
                    It's about time.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    A deal's a deal.
          
          He peels off some bills
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    How'd you do it?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Get her to act like a human
          
          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and 
          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. 
          She's almost burlesque.
          
          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on
          
          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts 
          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.
          
          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. 
          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Okay?
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm fine. I'm
          
          She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs  
          her again, bracing her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not okay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I just need to lie down for awhile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to 
                    sleep
          
                                 KAT
                    I know, just let me sleep
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What if you have a concussion? My dog 
                    went to sleep with a concussion and woke 
                    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell 
                    the difference...
          
          She tries to sit on the floor
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, 
                    okay?
          
          He pulls her back to her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    C'mon, let's walk
          
          INT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs 
          his arm.
          
          CAMERON We need to talk.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron, I'm a little busy
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's off. The whole thing.
          
          Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h 
          back on her feet.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What 're you talking about?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She's partial to Joey, not me
          
          Patrick doesn't have time for this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron -- do you like the girl?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (impatient)
                    Then, go get her
          
          Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron 
          stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice
          
          EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
          
                                 KAT
                    This is so patronizing.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Leave it to you to use big words when 
                    you're shitfaced.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why 're you doing this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I told you
          
                                 KAT
                    You don't care if I die
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, I do
          
                                 KAT
                    Why?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because then I'd have to start taking 
                    out girls who like me.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like you could find one
          
                                 PATRICK
                    See that?  Who needs affection when 
                    I've got blind hatred?
          
                                 KAT
                    Just let me sit down.
          
          He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a 
          swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How's that?
          
          She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then 
          FALLS over backward.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus.  You're like a weeble
          
          Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the 
          swing to keep her entertained.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Why'd you let him get to you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who? 
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate him.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big 
                    deal to get you to mainline tequila. You 
                    don't seem like the type.
          
                                 KAT
                           (holding up a 
                           drunken head)
                    Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can 
                    be "cool"?  You don't think I can be 
                    "laid back" like everyone else?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (slightly 
                           sarcastic)
                    I thought you were above all that
          
                                 KAT
                    You know what they say
          
          He stops the swing
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No. What do they say?
          
          Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Shit!
          
          He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up 
                    damn it!
          
          He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag 
          doll.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Kat! Wake up!  
          
                                 KAT
                           (waking)
                    What?
          
          He sighs with relief.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you were...
          
          They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES 
          on his shoes.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a 
          big swig.
          
          A KNOCK sounds at the door
          
                                 KAT
                    Go away
          
          Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the 
          smuggest of all possible grins.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Dinner taste better on the way out?
          
          Gives her a "don't even start" look.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I don't get you.  You act like you're 
                    too good for any of this, and then you 
                    go totally apeshit when you get here.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're welcome.
          
          She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.
          
          KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kat's in the driver's seat.  Patrick leans in and takes the 
          keys out of the ignition.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cute
          
          BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Kids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside 
          Joey catches up to them.
          
                                 JOEY
                    A bunch of us are going to Jaret's 
                    house.  Wanna come?
          
          Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.  
          She looks at her watch.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have to be home in twenty minutes.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (eagerly, to Joey)
                    I don't have to be home 'til two.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Then, c'mon.
                           (to Bianca)
                    Maybe next time --
          
          They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca
          
          Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca 
          standing alone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (slightly 
                           accusatory)
                    Have fun tonight?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Tons
          
          He starts to walk on
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Cameron?
          
          He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Do you think you could give me a ride 
                    home?
          
          INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling 
          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and 
          Patrick quickly changes it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm driving, so I get to pick the 
                    tunes.
          
          She changes it back to her song.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's my car.
          
          He changes it back.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    And I'm in control of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like 
                    them.  I saw you there.
          
          Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her 
          listen to her song.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    When you were gone last year -- where 
                    were you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Busy
          
                                 KAT
                    Were you in jail?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Maybe.
          
                                 KAT
                    No, you weren't
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then why'd you ask?
          
                                 KAT
                    Why'd you lie?
          
          He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the 
          music.  She bobs her head drunkenly.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I should do this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 KAT
                    This.
          
          She points to the radio
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Start a band?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (sarcastically)
                    My father wouldn't approve of that that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You don't strike me as the type that 
                    would ask permission.
          
          She turns to look at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, so now you think you know me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm gettin' there
          
          Her voice loses it's venom
          
                                 KAT
                    The only thing people know about me is 
                    that I'm "scary".
          
          He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary 
          right now.  He tries to hide his smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.
          
          They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, 
          realizing they're both created the same exterior for 
          themselves.
          
          Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He 
          looks up at her house.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    So what ' s up with your dad?  He a 
                    pain in the ass?
          
                                 KAT
                    He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Who?
          
                                 KAT
                                 BIANCA
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No offense, but you're sister is 
                    without.  I know everyone likes her and 
                    all, but ...
          
          Kat stares at him with new admiration.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know -- you're not as vile as I 
                    thought you were.
          
          She leans drunkenly toward him.
          
          Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then 
          Patrick turns away
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So, I'll see you in school
          
          Kat stares at him, pissed.  Then gets out of the car, 
          SLAMMING the door shut behind her.
          
          CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
          He finally breaks it.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I looked for you back at the party, but 
                    you always seemed to be "occupied".
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (faux-innocence )
                    I was?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You never wanted to go out with 'me, 
                    did you?
          
          Bianca bites her lip.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (reluctant)
                    Well, no...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Then that's all you had to say.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You always been this selfish?
          
          BIANCA thinks a minute
          
          He pulls up in front of the house
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Just because you're beautiful, doesn't 
                    mean you can treat people like they 
                    don't matter.
          
          She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and 
          gives him a kiss on the lips.  He draws back in surprise, 
          then kisses her back.  She smiles, then gets out of the car 
          without another word.
          
          Cameron grins and drives away
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    And I'm back in the saddle.
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the 
          others enter.  The White Rastas are first.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of 
                    my heart.
          
          He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
          
          CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found 
          friendliness.
          
                                 CLEM
                    Yippe kai-aye, bra. 
                           (to Kat)
                    Dance for me, cowgirl.
          
          He sits next to Derek
          
                                 CLEM 
                           (continuing)
                    Okay, now tell me again why he didn't 
                    shoot the deputy?
          
                                 DEREK
                    Because the deputy meant him no harm, 
                    my friend.  It was only the sheriff that 
                    was the oppressor.
          
          Joey saunters in and takes his seat.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Kat, babe, you were on fire.
          
          Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well now, did everyone have a good 
                    weekend?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Maybe we should ask Verona
          
          Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk.  Kat looks up, 
          down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.
          
          Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk 
          about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Okay then.  Well.
                           (beat)
                    Oh, yes
          
          She clears her throat.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    I'd like you all to write your own 
                    version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.
          
          Groans.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, 
                    whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate 
                    on his theme, however. Let's read it 
                    aloud, shall we? Anyone?
          
          The class is frozen in apathy.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Derek?
          
          Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in 
          his seat. Then grins.
          
                                 DEREK 
                           (reading; in his

                    Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom 
                    pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as

                                 MANDELLA
                    You went to the party?  I thought we 
                    were officially opposed to suburban 
                    social activity.

                    I didn't have a choice.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat 
                    and what have you done with her?
          
                                 KAT
                    I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

                    You didn't

                    I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.  
                    It was big fun.
          
          Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat 
          and smiles.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          She gathers her things and bolts out the door.  Patrick 
          looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.

                    So you got cozy with she who stings?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that 
                    I'm about to lose.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What'd you do to her?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I don ' t know. 
                           (beat)
                    I decided not to nail her when she was 
                    too drunk to remember it.
          
          Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then 
          turn back to Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          No shit.  She won't even look at me
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?
          
          Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility. 
          Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.

          Mandella is at her locker.  Drawings of William Shakespeare 
          adorn the door.  She looks at them with a sigh, then ties 
          her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut 
          off her air supply.
          
          Michael walks up.
          
                                 MICHAEL

                           loosens the scarf)

                                 MANDELLA
                    Yeah.  I guess.
          
          MICHAEL rocks.  Very hip.

                    Oh yeah.
          
          She looks at him suspiciously
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who could refrain that had a heart to 
                    love and in that heart, courage to make 
                    ' B love known?
          
          Michael thinks for a minute.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Macbeth, right?
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (happily stunned)
                    Right.

                    Yeah...
          
          He leans in close to her, conspiratorially

                    You were right. She's still pissed.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Sweet love, renew thy force!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. 
                    People can hear you.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (exasperated)
                    You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice  
                    yourself on the altar of dignity and  
                    even the score.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Best case scenario, you're back on the 
                    payroll for awhile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's the worst?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You get the girl.
          
          Patrick  thinks for a minute
          
                                 PATRICK
                    If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz 
          Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.
          
          From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. 
          Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
          
          The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".  Being sung by Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    "This morning, I woke up with this 
                    feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, 
                    and so I just decided to myself--"
          
          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands 
          beneath the window, crooning.
          
          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and 
          doing backup vocal s.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    "I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk 
                    about it.  And didn't I go and shout it 
                    when you walked into the room --"
          
          He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
          
          IN THE CLASSROOM
          
          Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. 
          Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big 
          finale.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    " I think I love you I "
          
          INSIDE
          
          The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, 
          mortified, but with a slight smile
          
          INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling 
          over their misfortune.
          
                                 MISCREANT 
                    Nice song, Verona.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Flog me.
          
          He makes the appropriate hand gesture
          
          Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, 
          ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
          
                                 KAT (0. S.)
                    Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
          
          Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat 
          standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little.
          
          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He 
          turns fully to face her.
          
                                 KAT
                    Sir, I'd like to state for the record 
                    that Mr. Verona ' s current 
                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never 
                    filed a complaint.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You didn't have to.  He disrupted a 
                    classroom.
          
          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the 
          window.
          
          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.
          
          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."
          
          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window.
          
          The other miscreants watch with glee.
          
                                 KAT
                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.
          
          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy 
          about it, considering they're on the second floor.
          
          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. 
                    Rules stick.
          
          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something 
                    I've always wanted to show you.
          
          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.
          
          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make 
          the jump.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    These.
          
          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
          
          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the 
          flash of skin.
          
          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.  
                    But if I catch you doing that again, 
                    you'll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys.
          
          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without 
          noticing Patrick's absence.
          
          Kat smiles at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
          
          Kat bolts out the door.  Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle 
          mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN
          
          Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing 
          no one.
          
                                 KAT
                    He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he 
                    cruised on me.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    Look up, sunshine
          
          She does.  He's still in the tree
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I guess I never told you I'm afraid of 
                    heights.
          
                                 KAT
                           (smiling)
                    C'mon.  It's not that bad
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Try lookin' at it from this angle
          
          She assesses the branch structure
          
                                 KAT
                    Put your right foot there --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
          
                                 KAT
                    You want me to climb up and show you 
                    how to get down?
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (voice trembling)
                    Maybe.
          
          She sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she 
          perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her.
          
          Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a 
          monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been 
          duped.
          
                                 KAT
                    You shit!
          
          She climbs down after him
          
          EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY 
          
          Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
          
                                 KAT
                    The Partridge Family?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I figured it had to be something 
                    ridiculous to win your respect.  And 
                    piss you off.
          
                                 KAT
                    Good call.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So how'd you get Chapin to look the 
                    other way?
          
                                 KAT
                    I dazzled him with my wit
          
          She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at 
          giggling hyenas and wails on it.  The barker hands her a 
          stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID 
          next to her and they continue walking.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    A soft side? Who knew?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, well, don't let it get out
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what's your excuse?
          
                                 KAT
                    Acting the way we do.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yes
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't like to do what people expect.  
                    Then they expect it all the time and 
                    they get disappointed when you change.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So if you disappoint them from the 
                    start, you're covered?
          
                                 KAT
                    Something like that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then you screwed up
          
                                 KAT
                    How?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You never disappointed me.
          
          She blushes under his gaze
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You up for it?
          
                                 KAT
                    For. . . ?
          
          He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins 
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          
          The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, 
          stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
          
          Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
          Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
          
          Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of 
          her face.
          
          Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
          shots, they're both covered in paint
          
          She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
          empty.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Damn it!
          
          Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.  They land, 
          laughing.
          
          It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
          are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
          find each other's eyes.
          
          He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he 
          goes to kiss her.

                    Look, Mom
          
          His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has 
          turned into a passionate kiss
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway.  Their paint wardrobe 
          has dried by now and they look like refugees from some 
          strange, yet colorful, war.
          
                                 KAT

                                 PATRICK
                    Fallacy.
          
                                 KAT
                    The duck?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hearsay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know the porn career's a lie.
          
          He shuts off the car and turns to her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do you?
          
          He kisses her neck.  It tickles.  She laughs.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tell me something true.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I hate peas.
          
                                 KAT
                    No -- something real.  Something no one 
                    else knows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (in-between kisses)
                    You're sweet.  And sexy.  And 
                    completely hot for me.
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No one else knows
          
                                 KAT
                    You're amazingly self-assured. Has 
                    anyone ever told you that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Go to the prom with me
          
          Kat's smile disappears.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that a request or a command?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know what I mean
          
                                 KAT
                    No.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No what?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, I won't go with you
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Why not?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because I don't want to. It's a stupid 
                    tradition.
          
          Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he 
          being paid to take her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    People won't expect you to go...
          
          Kat turns to him, getting angry.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                                 KAT
                    All of it -- what's in it for you?
          
          He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her 
          suspicions.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Create a little drama?  Start a new 
                    rumor?  What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So I have to have a motive to be with 
                    you?
          
                                 KAT
                    You tell me.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told 
                    you that?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (quietly)
                    Answer the question, Patrick
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (angry)
                    Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me.  
                    Just the pleasure of your company.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.  She breaks it in half before she 
          SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
          
          Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front 
          door and watches him go
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
          
          He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who 
          has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
          
          Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey 
          gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    cover that up
          
          The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face 
          Bianca TAPS on the open door.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Quick question -- are you going to the 
                    prom?
          
          Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM
          
          INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby.  She 
          fingers a strand of her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Then Guillermo says, "If you go any 
                    lighter, you're gonna look like an extra 
                    on 90210."
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No...
          
          Bianca stares at him for a moment.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    do you listen to this crap?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What crap?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm 
                    like, boring myself.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thank God!  If I had to hear one more 
                    story about your coiffure...
          
          He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and 
          smacks his hand away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    I figured you'd get to the good stuff 
                    eventually.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What good stuff?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The "real you".
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like my fear of wearing pastels?
          
          He looks stricken.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I'm kidding. 
                           (beat)
                    You know how sometimes you just become 
                    this "persona"?  And you don't know how 
                    to quit?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (matter of fact)
                    No
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how 
                    to lie.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.  Finally, it 
          opens.
          
          Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th 
          Century.  Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
          
          INSERT - "0 FAIR ONE.  JOIN ME AT THE PROM.  I WILL BE 
          WAITING.  LOVE, WILLIAM S."
          
          Mandella's agog.  Trevor walks by and sees her holding the 
          dress.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're gonna look splendiferous in 
                    that, Mandella.
          
          Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                           (continuing)
                    that's cool to say.
          
          Mandella grins It is

          Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike
          
                                 SHARON
                    Would you rather be ravished by a 
                    pirate or a British rear admiral?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Pirate -- no question.
          
          Bianca enters and walks over to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with 
                    you. It's tomorrow night --
          
                                 WALTER
                    The prom?  Kat has a date?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, but
          
                                 WALTER
                    It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s 
                    who you want me to bend my rules for?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that 
                    is.
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're not going unless your sister 
                    goes.  End of story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my 
                    own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a 
                    possession!
          
          Bianca storms out.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (calling out)
                    You know what happens at proms?
          
          Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
          
                                 SHARON
                    They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll 
                    come home.  Let her go.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Kissing?  Is that what you think 
                    happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up 
                    to my elbows in placenta all day.
          
          INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca lies on her bed.  MTV blares.  A KNOCK sounds.
          
          BIANCA
          Come in.
          
          Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (kindly)
                    Listen, I know you hate having to sit 
                    home because I'm not Susie High School.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like you care.
          
                                 KAT
                    I do care. But I'm a firm believer in 
                    doing something for your own reasons, 
                    not someone else ' s .
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only 
                    sophomore that got asked to the prom and 
                    I can't go, because you won ' t.
          
          Kat clears her throat
          
                                 KAT
                    Joey never told you we went out, did 
                    he?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    In 9th.  For a month

                           (confused)
                    Why?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (self-mocking)
                    He was, like, a total babe
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But you hate Joey
          
                                 KAT
                    Now I do.  Back then, was a different 
                    story.

                    As in...
          
          Kat takes a deep breath.
          
                                 KAT
                    He said everyone was doing it.  So I 
                    did it.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did what?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing on)
                    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I 
                    didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.  
                    He got pissed.  Then he broke up with 
                    me.
          
          Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 KAT
                    After that, I swore I'd never do 
                    anything just because "everyone else" 
                    was doing it.  And I haven't since. 
                    Except for Bogey's party, and my 
                    stunning gastro-intestinal display --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (stunned)
                    Why didn't you tell me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I wanted to let you make up your own 
                    mind about him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No. you didn't!  If you really thought 
                    I could make my own decisions, you 
                    would've let me go out with him instead 
                    of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
          
          Kat stands up slowly
          
                                 KAT
                    That's not
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'm not stupid enough to repeat your 
                    mistakes.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I thought I was protecting you.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    God, you're just like him! Just keep me 
                    locked away in the dark, so I can't 
                    experience anything for myself
          
                                 KAT
                    Not all experiences are good, Bianca. 
                    You can't always trust the people you 
                    want to.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I guess I'll never know, will I?
          
          She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it 
          behind her.
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
          
          A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  She rolls over and 
          picks up the phone.
          
          BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while 
          watching "I Love Lucy" reruns.
          
          A KNOCK sounds
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Come in.
          
          Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
          
                                 KAT
                    Feel like shopping?
          
          Bianca looks up, hopefully.
          
          LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.  Walter 
          has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What do you wanna watch?  We've got 
                    crap, crap, crap or crap
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Dr. Ruth?
          
          Bianca walks into the living room.  She's wearing a prom 
          dress.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi, Mommy.
                           (looking away)
                                 WALTER
          
          Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca 
          to Sharon.
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Honey, you look beautiful!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You like?  My date should be here in 
                    five.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm missing something.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a 
                    captain of oppression like some men we 
                    know.
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS.  Bianca runs to open it.  There stands 
          CAMERON.  He takes in Bianca's outfit.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Wow
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let's go.
          
          Walter rises.  Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
          
                                 SHARON 
                           (to Bianca)
                    Have a great time, honey!
          
                                 WALTER
                    But -- who -- what --?
          
          The door SLAMS.  As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a 
          blur rushes down the stairs and out the door.  The blur has 
          Kat ' s voice.
          
                                 KAT
                    Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See 
                    you in a few.
          
          The door SLAMS again.  Walter and Sharon 'are alone
          
                                 WALTER
                    What just happened?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Your daughters went to the prom.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Did I have anything to say about it?
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Absolutely not.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That ' s what I thought
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on 
          the porch, wearing a tux.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    I'm here to pick up Bianca.
          
                                 WALTER
                    late
          
          He SLAMS the door shut
          
          EXT  HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
          
          Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice 
          gown.
          
          Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.  In a tux.
          
                                 KAT
                    How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted.  
                    Where'd you get the dress?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just something I had.  You know
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Oh huh
          
                                 KAT
                    Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I 
                    questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
          
          Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No prob.
          
          He remains seated.  Kat fidgets nervously.
          
                                 KAT
                    are you ready?
          
          He rises and stares at her, taking in her image 
          appreciatively.  She blushes and turns away.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    C'mon.  Let's get this over with.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.  Patrick 
          and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Quite the ostentatious display
          
          A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Look, Clem even wore his good boots
          
          Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and 
          Bianca dancing cheek to cheek.  She smiles.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, 
          hair piled on top of her head.  She spots Kat and hurries 
          over.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Have you seen him?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William - he asked me to meet him here.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' 
                    progressed to full-on hallucinations.
          
          Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.  She turns and 
          points Mandella the same way.
          
          Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on 
          his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella's grin couldn't 
          be bigger.
          
          Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand 
          and leading her onto the dance floor.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Mi' lady.
          
                           (to Patrick)
                    Good sir.
          
          Patrick rolls his eyes.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT - LATER
          
          Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG.  Whatever he's 
          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.
          
          Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She 
          whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room
          
          INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a 
          stall.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (surprised)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    You think you ' re the only sophomore 
                    at the prom?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I did.
          
          Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    And just so you know, my date isn't 
                    planning on spending most of the night 
                    in his backseat.
          
          BIANCA What're you talking about?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - 
                    your cherry. He practically made a 
                    public announcement.
          
          Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity  tries to backpedal.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (continuing)
                    I wanted to tell you
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few 
          stray jocks - also dateless.  He zeroes in on Cameron, now 
          consoling a pissed-off Bianca.
          
          Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the 
          evil about to erupt.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    My grandmother's .
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    That's where I was last year.  She'd 
                    never lived alone -- my grandfather died 
                    -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, 
                    I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've 
                    never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent 
                    a year sitting next to my grandma on the 
                    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of 
                    story.
          
          He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat 
          stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh
          
                                 KAT
                    That ' s completely adorable!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It gets worse -- you still have your 
                    freshman yearbook?
          
          He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's Bianca doing here with that 
                    cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let 
                    some little punk ass snake me.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to 
          Cameron and Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Feces hitting fan.  C'mon
          
          Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca 
          staring after them.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt 
          Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this 
          situation.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it 
                    easy.
          
          Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.
          
          JOEY You two are in big trouble
          
          Cameron faces Joey.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.
          
          Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise 
          Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
          
          The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon 
          surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White 
          Rastas.
          
                                 DEREK 
                    Very uncool, my brother
          
                                 JOEY
                    I'm not your brother, white boy.
          
          The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that 
          they're white.
          
          Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Just so you know -- she'll only spread 
                    her legs once.
          
          Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing. 
          Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. 
          It's Bianca.  And she BELTS the hell out of him
          
                                 BIANCA
                    That's for making my date bleed
          
          She BELTS him again
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    That's for my sister.
          
          And AGAIN
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    And that's for me.
          
          Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.
          
                                 COWBOY
                    And that's for the fourth grade, 
                    asshole.
          
          HOTEL - NIGHT 
          
          KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Wait I...
          
                                 KAT
                    You were paid to take me out!  By -- 
                    the one person I truly hate.  I knew it 
                    was a set-up!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It wasn't like that.
          
                                 KAT
                    Really?  What was it like?  A down 
                    payment now, then a bonus for sleeping 
                    with me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I didn't care about the money.
          
          He catches up to her now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I cared about --
          
          She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than 
          in anger.
          
                                 KAT
                    You are so not what I thought you were.
          
          He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, 
          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.
          
          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She's 
          never looked more guilty.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a 
          blanket, watching "Sixteen Candles".  When Molly Ringwald 
          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream 
          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an 
          infomercial
          
          The phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes 
          in, bearing a cup of tea.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Are you sure you don't want to come 
                    with us?  It'll be fun.
          
          Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
          
                                 KAT
                    I ' m sure .
          
          Bianca sits down next to her
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You looked beautiful last night, you 
                    know.
          
                                 KAT
                    So did you
          
          Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL 
          rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his 
          head inside.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She okay?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I hope so.
          
          The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Was that your sister?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big 
                    ones.  Full of sperm.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Funny.
          
          Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the 
          infomercial with Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I don't understand the allure of 
                    dehydrated food.  Is this something I 
                    should be hip to?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, Daddy.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (dreading the 
                           answer)
                    So tell me about this dance. Was it 
                    fun?
          
                                 KAT
                    Parts of it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Which parts?
          
                                 KAT
                    The part where Bianca beat the hell out 
                    of some guy.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Bianca did what?
          
                                 KAT
                    What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed 
                    off on her?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No -- impressed.
          
          Kat looks up in surprise.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    You know, fathers don't like to admit 
                    that their daughters are capable of 
                    running their own lives.  It means we've 
                    become spectators.  Bianca still lets me 
                    play a few innings.  You've had me on 
                    the bleachers for years.  When you go to 
                    Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to 
                    watch the game.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (hopeful)
                    When I go?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've 
                    changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a 
                    check.
          
          Kat reaches over and gives him a hug
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes 
          from the food line.
          
                                 CAMERON (0. S.)
                    Katarina?
          
          She turns and looks at him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'd like to express my apologies.
          
                                 KAT
                    For what?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    I didn't mean for you to get -- When 
                    Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, 
                    I had no idea it would turn out so -- 
                    ugly. I would never have  done anything 
                    to compromise your - - -
          
          He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray 
          against the wall and marched off -- the old "kill, kill" 
          look back in her eyes.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace
          
          CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open 
          book in hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Who can tell me at what point Lucentio 
                    admits his deception?
          
          The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks 
          in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward 
          the hallway.
          
                                 KAT

          HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair 
          between two rows of lockers.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let go!
          
                                 KAT
                    You set me up.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I just wanted --
          
                                 KAT
                    What? To completely damage me?  To send 
                    me to therapy forever? What?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No! I just wanted
          
          Miss Perky walks up
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my 
                    office?
          
          INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, 
          then focuses on Bianca.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    So you're the real bitch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch.  
                    I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I 
                    could.  Apparently, this makes me a 
                    horrible person.  I'm sorry.
          
          She turns to Kat.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I swear -- I didn't know about the 
                    money.  I didn't even know Joey was 
                    involved.  I would never intentionally 
                    hurt you, Kat.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Kat)
                    Do you care to respond?
          
                                 KAT
                    Am I supposed to feel better? Like, 
                    right now?  Or do I have some time to 
                    think about it?
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    Just smack her now.
          
          Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.

          ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
          
          Mrs. Blaise faces the class
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    All right.  I'm assuming everyone found 
                    time to compose, their poems. Except for 
                    Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.
          
          Nerds in the back high-five each other.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
          
          No one moves.  Then Kat slowly stands up.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'11 go
          
          Patrick looks up.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Oh, Lord.
          
          She downs a couple Prozac
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Please proceed.
          
          Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath 
          before reading from her notebook.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate the way you talk to me/ and the 
                    way you cut your hair/ I hate the way 
                    you drive my car/ I hate it when you 
                    stare.
          
          She pauses, then continues
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and 
                    the way you read my mind/ I hate you so 
                    much it makes me sick/ it even makes me 
                    rhyme.
          
          She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who 
          stares at the floor.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate the way you're always right/ I 
                    hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you 
                    make me laugh/ even worse when you make 
                    me cry/ I hate it that you're not 
                    around/ and the fact that you didn't 
                    call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ' 
                    t hate you/ not even close, not even a 
                    little bit, not even any at all.
          
          She looks directly at Patrick.  He looks back this time.  
          The look they exchange says everything.
          
          Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains 
          in stunned silence.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's 
          greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the 
          front seat.
          
          She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins 
          around.
          
          Patrick stands there, smiling.
          
                                 KAT
                    A Fender Strat. You bought this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you could use it. When you 
                    start your band.
          
          She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Besides, I had some extra cash. Some 
                    asshole paid me to take out a really 
                    great girl.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that right?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for 
                    her.
          
          Blushes and looks down.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You know -- it's not every day you find 
                    a girl who'll flash her tits to get you 
                    out of detention.
          
          Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
          
          He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does 
          She lets him this time.
          
          Then breaks it off
          
                                 KAT
                    You can't just buy me a guitar every 
                    time you screw up, you know.
          
          He grimaces.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know
          
          He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
          
                                 KAT
                    And don't just think you can
          
          He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET
          
          We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET
          
          Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers.  Kat 
          watches.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why is my veggie burger the only burnt 
                    object on this grill?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because I like to torture you.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman 
                    yearbook?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Don ' t you even dare. . .
          
          ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They do to!

                    They do not!
          
          Rises to get the yearbook.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Can someone please tell her that 
                    sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?
          
          ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
          
          Severely making-out in a lawn chair.  She comes up for a 
          breath.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    I can't remember a word of Shakespeare 
                    right now. Isn't that weird?
          
          Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND 
          PATRICK
          
          She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca 
          now hands her.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're freaked over this, aren't you?
          
          Bianca hands her the yearbook
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's more than freaked.  He's froke
          
          Flips to a page.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'd like to call your attention to 
                    Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look 
                    of 1995 ---
          
          INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses, 
          bad hair, headgear -- the works.
          
          She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes 
          and throws a handful of pretzels at her.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Patrick -- is that- a.

                                 PATRICK
                    Ask my attorney.
          
          Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --  as we 
          CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".

          EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK
          
          A few cars scatter the parking lot. WE hear GRUNTS followed
          by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - CONTINUOUS
          
          An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17.
          Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a
          hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots.
          SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic.
          
          Mike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and
          short shorts circa 1989.
          
          Mustached and curly haired COACH HARVEY, 40, enters.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the
                    game.
          
          Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the Coach.
          
                              MIKE
                    Just warming up, Coach.
          
          Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    First game of the season and the
                    scouts are already lining up. You
                    have half the season I know you're
                    capable of, you can play anywhere
                    you want, Mike.
          
                              MIKE
                    That's the plan coach.
          
          The rest of the FITCH FALCONS basketball team jogs out from
          the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Round up, Jock Straps! Picture
                    time.
          
          The Team assembles in the middle of the court. A PLAYER
          kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 1989'.
          
                               MIKE
                    Hold on.   Ed's not here yet.
          
          DOM, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs-
          
                                                                     2.
          
          
          
                                  DOM
                    Who cares?      He's the water boy.
          
                              MIKE
                    And you suck, Dom, but we're
                    letting you in the picture.
          
          A shoving match breaks out between Mike and Dom.
          
                                  COACH HARVEY
                    Hey!   Hey!     Knock it off.
          
          Coach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors
          burst open. ED FREEDMAN, 17, sporting a jacket over a WIZARD
          costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his
          clothes off.
          
                              ED
                    Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a
                    life and death battle with the dark
                    wizard...
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    ...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up.
          
          Ed takes a spot next to Dom.
          
                              PHOTOGRPAHER
                    And 3, 2, 1-
          
          WE see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his
          underwear...RRRRIIIPP...FLASH. And with the flash WE cut to:
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT
          
          The Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court.    On
          the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE warms up.
          
          Lights dim. Cue MC Hammer's `Can't Touch This'. CHEERLEADERS
          at center court perform the Hammer DANCE ROUTINE. PAN around
          the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance.
          
          Ed awkwardly tries to imitate Mike.
          
          Coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends-
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
          
          The Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats.     Ed hands waters
          to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike.
          
                                                                  3.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    Ed, I can't help you with the girls
                    if you keep showing up places
                    dressed like the Cookie Crisp guy.
                    Okay? Dude, don't look now but I
                    think Muffy Campanella is scopin'
                    you hard.
          
                                ED
                    For real?
          
          Ed jerks around to blatantly stare at her.
          
                              MIKE
                    Smile, pud.
          
          Ed flashes a goofy smile.   MUFFY mimes puking.
          
                                MIKE (CONT'D)
                    My bad.
          
                                GIRL'S VOICE (o.s.)
                    Mike?
          
          SCARLET, 17, an 80's beauty, stands at the end of the bench.
          
                              MIKE
                    Who's that stone cold fox? Oh,
                    it's my girlfriend.
                        (walks over)
                    I'm glad you're here, Scar. This
                    whole scout thing's got me wicked
                    nervous.
          
          Dom dribbles past, smiles at Scarlet.
          
                              DOM
                    I'm dedicating my first basket to
                    you, Scarlet.
          
                              MIKE
                    Way you shoot that might be mid-
                    season!
                        (to Scarlet)
                    Everything cool?
          
          She smiles nervously, lies...
          
                               SCARLET
                    Oh yeah. Everything's totally
                    copacetic.
          
                                                                         4.
          
          
          
                       MIKE                              SCARLET
          Totally?                           Totally.
          
          REFEREE blows the whistle.
          
                               COACH HARVEY
                     Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners
                     get the girls. Losers please
                     themselves!
          
                               MIKE
                         (to Scarlet)
                     Excellent. Gotta run.
          
          He kisses her cheek, starts off, turns back-
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                     What's wrong?
          
          LONG SHOT: We hear nothing but see Mike's body deflate. He
          steps away from Scarlet towards center court.
          
          Muffy and her friends mock Ed and laugh hysterically
          
                               ED
                     Do you really think Muffy's in to
                     me?
          
          Mike, in a daze walks right past Ed. Takes his place for the
          jump ball. The Crowd stomps and cheers LOUDLY.
          
          The Ref is about to toss the ball. Mike looks up at the
          stands, sees a crushed Scarlet heading for the exit. Mike's
          torn. Play or go after her. He goes after her.
          
                               COACH HARVEY
                     Where you going!? O'Donnell!?
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
          Mike rushes in.
          
                                 MIKE
                     Scar!    Wait.
          
          She turns, slumps against the wall.    Mike catches up to her.
          Mike leans in and kisses Scarlet.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          EXT. PALISADES NEIGHBORHOOD. PRESENT DAY - MORNING
          
          Opulent HOMES.   OCEAN views.   Luxury CARS.   Manicured LAWNS.
          
          The sound of an alarm clock shatters the silence as WE settle
          in on a large, MEDITERRANEAN STYLE HOUSE.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          MIKE O'DONNELL, now 36, angrily slaps the alarm off...6 AM.
          He climbs out of bed, bones creaking, stiff, groans.
          
          
          INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
          
          A showered, suited Mike stands before the mirror, knots a tie
          around his neck.
          
                              MIKE
                        (UNINSPIRED)
                    Today is going to be a good day.     I
                    love my job. I am a lucky man.
                    Who's lucky? Mike O'Donnell.
          
          Mike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING
          
          ED FREEDMAN, now 36, lies on a portable table in his boxers.
          ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES protrude from every inch of his body,
          neck and face...at least 5000 needles.
          
          A HOT, YOUNG ACUPUNCTURIST adds more to him.
          
                              ACUPUNCTURIST
                    Can you feel your Qi flowing
                    freely?
          
                              ED
                    I'm not sure if its my Qi or
                    internal bleeding.
          
          Mike enters, shakes his head in amusement.
          
                              MIKE
                    What are you doing now?
          
          Ed looks over, sees Mike watching.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine.
                    Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the
                    rage. Makes you look five years
                    younger.
          
          Ed climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in
          pain the entire way. He pours himself a shot of BROWN LIQUID
          from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately SPITS it
          all over the place.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                        (calls to Acupuncturist)
                    What's this brown stuff again?
          
                              ACUPUNCTURIST
                    Rhinoceros urine. Pure protein.
          
                              ED
                    Delish!
                        (to Mike)
                    The girl has absolutely no clue
                    what she's doing.
          
                              MIKE
                    Then why are you letting her stick
                    needles in you?
          
                              ED
                    Because she's hot. But today's not
                    about me. It's about you becoming
                    the new regional sales manager.
          
                              MIKE
                    I better be. I've invested 18
                    years of my life in that miserable
                    company.
          
                              ED
                    No negativity. Negativity's for
                    the 800 pound fat lady who needs to
                    be airlifted out of bed. You,
                    Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a
                    winner.
          
                              MIKE
                    A winner doesn't have to crash at
                    his best friend's house because he
                    was kicked out of his own house.
          
                              ED
                    Are you kidding?! It doesn't get
                    any better than this!
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                    7.
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    I gotta get back. My legs just
                    went numb. Good luck today.
          
          Ed drags painfully back to the Acupuncturist.
          
          
          EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - MORNING
          
          Mike wheels his Audi A4 below a nondescript, two level
          building. Sign reads, `Wyatt Pharmaceuticals'.
          
          
          INT. WYATT PHARMACEUTICALS/CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
          
          PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG POSTERS cover the walls.    Smiling faces,
          happy couples...little pills.
          
          Surrounding a conference table are Mike's colleagues...HOT
          WOMEN, 20 to 35, in skimpy business suits, chatting away.
          
          Mike sits amongst them, the only male present. A glum look
          on his face. WENDY, bubbly, ditsy, 22, leans over to him.
          
                              WENDY
                    Congratulations, Mike. You deserve
                    it. You're like a totally amazing
                    salesman.
          
                              MIKE
                    Thanks, Wendy. That like totally
                    means so much to me.
          
          ROGER, 23, boss, strides through the door.
          
                              ROGER
                    Good morning, peeps. As you all
                    know, today I'll be naming the new
                    regional sales manager. What's it
                    take to be an RSM? Leadership
                    skills, a comprehensive knowledge
                    of today's prescription
                    pharmaceuticals and most
                    importantly a dedicated soldier.
          
          Mike straightens his tie, buttons his suit jacket.
          
                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    All being said, congratulations-
                        (Mike begins to rise)
                    Wendy.
          
          Dumbfounded, Mike slumps back into his seat.    Wendy springs
          up out of hers, SCREAMING and BOUNCING.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          
          
                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    Now go out there and sell some
                    drugs peeps!
          
          The Women stream out.
          
                              MIKE
                    How could you do this to me? I've
                    been a salesman here 18 years.
                    Wendy's only been here 2 months!?
          
                              ROGER
                    Look, your sales are admittedly
                    better but she has the college
                    degree. What can I do?
          
                              MIKE
                    You can give me the promotion,
                    Roger!
          
                              ROGER
                    Things have changed. I couldn't
                    even hire you now with only a high
                    school diploma. My hands are tied,
                    bro-ski.
          
          Mike swallows his pride and exits.
          
          
          EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DUSK
          
          Mike pulls into the empty parking lot, climbs out of his car
          and into the building.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DUSK
          
          Mike hurries down the hall, opens a door, peeks his head in.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DUSK
          
          Mike peers around...nobody.
          
                               MIKE
                    Alex?
          
          No answer. A basketball sits in the middle of the floor.
          Mike enters, picks up the ball, begins dribbling...faster,
          between his legs, around his back, up to the 3 point line-
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                    3, 2, 1-
          
                                                                     9.
          
          
          
          Mike hits a perfect jumper at the imaginary buzzer, smiles.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    The kid's still got it.
          
          Mike dashes for the bouncing ball, scoops it up, goes for a
          reverse lay up, makes it but when he lands...he
          lands...CRACK...hard. Mike grabs his lower back, groans-
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Ooooh.   That was stupid.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DUSK
          
          Mike limps out of the gym, wanders over to a wall covered in
          PHOTOGRAPHS...Fitch basketball teams of the past.
          
          Mike searches the pictures until he finds it...the photo WE
          saw being taken earlier...the team of 1989. Ed mid howl from
          Dom's wedgy.
          
          Mike stares at the photograph...lost in time and thought.
          The smiling, confident image of his youth stares back at him.
          
                              MALE VOICE (o.s.)
                    You know someone in that picture?
          
          Mike startles from his daydream, turns. A kind-faced, old
          JANITOR, stands behind him, mop in hand.
          
                                MIKE
                    I do. Me.     I'm in the center
                    there.
          
          The Janitor leans in, takes a closer look at Young Mike.
          
                              JANITOR
                    Adolescence can be so cruel.
          
                              MIKE
                    What are you talking about?
                        (lost in the picture
                         AGAIN)
                    I had life by the balls in that
                    picture. Everything was possible.
                    Then a few minutes later, pffffft,
                    all gone.
          
                              JANITOR
                    `For of all sad words of tongue and
                    pen, the saddest are these: `It
                    might have been...'
          
                                                                    10.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    That'll be my epitaph.
          
                              JANITOR
                    We all have regrets.
          
                              MIKE
                    Why's it have to be that way?
          
                              JANITOR
                    Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
                    Can't hurt to ask. You never know
                    who's listening, Michael.
          
          Michael wistfully eyes the old photo, looks back to the
          JANITOR-
          
                              MIKE
                    How did you know...
          
                              ALEX (O.S.)
                    ...What are you doing, Dad?
          
          ALEX, 15, messy hair and slight, and MAGGIE, 17 and awkwardly
          pretty, appear at the other end of the hall.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Hey, Guys.     I was just talking to-
          
          Mike looks back to the Janitor...GONE.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Never mind. Sorry I'm late. You
                    ready to get some dinner then?
          
          They make their way towards the door.    Mike limping.
          
                              ALEX
                    Why are you limping?
          
                              MIKE
                    Tweaked my back pumping iron.
                    Really, really heavy iron.
          
          
          INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - NIGHT
          
          Mike, Alex and Maggie sit before dinner.    Alex eats heartily.
          Maggie quietly pushes her food around.
          
                              MIKE
                    I bet your chompin' at the bit for
                    hoop season to start.
          
                                                          11.
          
          
          
                              ALEX
                    Yeah, me and the guys are running
                    drills, scrimmaging, getting in
                    shape.
          
          Maggie stifles a laugh.
          
                              MIKE
                    That's my boy. Remember, it's not
                    how big you are-
          
                              ALEX
                    -it's how big you play.
          
          Father and Son touch fists.
          
                              MIKE
                    And what about you, Mags?   What's
                    new?
          
                                MAGGIE
                    Nothing.
          
                              ALEX
                    She got into Georgetown.
          
                                MIKE
                    You did!?    That's fantastic!
          
                              MAGGIE
                    It's no big deal.
          
                              MIKE
                    It's a huge deal. That's a great
                    university. I'm proud of you.
                        (Maggie remains quiet)
                    Am I missing something here?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    You wouldn't understand.
          
                                MIKE
                    Try me.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    I have a lot of emotional stress
                    right now. My friends are all
                    going to different schools, I'm not
                    even sure...
          
                                                                     12.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    That's not stress. Wait `til you
                    get out into the real world, get a
                    crappy job, have some smarmy twerp-
                    boss calling you bro-ski...
          
          Maggie rolls her eyes.
          
                              ALEX
                    Did you get the promotion, Dad?
          
                              MIKE
                    Still waiting to hear.
          
          Mike forces a smile hiding his disappointment.
          
          
          EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY/MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Mike pulls up behind a `Dom's Nursery' van. He, Alex and
          Maggie step out. Mike eyes the van with disdain.
          
                              MIKE
                    Is your mom home?
          
                              ALEX
                    She's probably out back.
          
                              MIKE
                    Hey, next week we'll have a
                    barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound
                    good?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    I'm counting down the minutes.
          
          Maggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside.
          
                              MIKE
                    What's with her?
          
                              ALEX
                    We see you once a week for a couple
                    hours. What do you expect?
          
          Alex follows Maggie into the house.   Mike makes his way
          around back.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
          
          As Mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling Dom
          Johnson, 36. Don lugs 3 loaded trash bags.
          
                                                                     13.
          
          
          
                              DOM
                    Hey, Mike. Good to see you.    Tough
                    break, you and Scarlet.
          
                              MIKE
                    Bite me, Dom.
          
          Dom serves Mike a cocky wink, continues on.    Mike scowls.
          
          Scarlet, 36, slams a shovel into the ground, wedges it
          beneath a dying shrub and rips it out.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    A little late for a delivery isn't
                    it?
          
                              SCARLET
                    Dom was in the neighborhood. He
                    offered to make a dump run for me.
          
                              MIKE
                    Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?
          
                              SCARLET
                    What's your point?
          
                              MIKE
                    Come on. He's been after you since
                    10th grade and he's after you now.
          
                              SCARLET
                    At least someone's after me.
          
          Mike smiles playfully and begins to serenade-
          
                              MIKE
                    `In touch with the ground, I'm on
                    the hunt I'm after you.'
          
          Scarlet shakes her head-
          
                              SCARLET
                    Please, Mike. This isn't high
                    school. That's not gonna work.
          
                              MIKE
                    `Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a
                    crowd, and I'm hungry like the
                    wolf.'
          
          Mike flirtatiously stalks her.   Scarlet fights smiling.
          
                                                                 14.
          
          
          
                              SCARLET
                    You can stop now. It's not
                    working.
          
                              MIKE
                    `Mouth is alive, with juices like
                    wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf'
          
          Mike gets close to Scarlet's face. She smiles, stops herself
          and pushes him away.
          
                              SCARLET
                    You no longer have the right to
                    invoke the "wolf."
          
          A chastised Mike eyes the yard...it's a WRECK...holes and
          mounds of dirt everywhere, carcasses of dead plants, bushes
          and flowers strewn about.
          
                              MIKE
                    Why are you destroying the yard?
          
          Scarlet stops shoveling, wipes dirt from her face.
          
                              SCARLET
                    I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for
                    clients. Thanks for asking.
          
                              MIKE
                    Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?
          
                              SCARLET
                    I am a landscape designer. Then
                    again you barely took an interest
                    in my work so I guess that's a fair
                    question.
          
          An awkward silence.   Then-
          
                              MIKE
                    I didn't get it.
          
                              SCARLET
                    I'm sorry. But maybe this is what
                    you needed. Maybe it's time you
                    looked for something else?
          
                              MIKE
                    That's a great idea, Scar. Because
                    there are so many options out there
                    for a 36 year old with only a high
                    school diploma.
          
                                                                      15.
          
          
          
          Scarlet throws the shovel to the ground.
          
                              SCARLET
                    And it's all my fault, isn't it?
          
                              MIKE
                    I didn't say that.
          
                              SCARLET
                    No, but it's what you think, right?
          
          Mike's silence says it all.    Scarlet fights back tears.
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    I never asked you to marry me.
          
                                 MIKE
                    But I did.
          
          Scarlet shakes her head in frustration.
          
                              SCARLET
                    I'm sorry you're not happy with the
                    way your life turned out Mike,
                    really, I am, but you're not the
                    victim here.
          
          Scarlet goes back to shoveling.    Mike turns, steps, falls
          into a hole.
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S AUDI - NIGHT
          
          A somber Mike drives alongside the Los Angeles River. An old
          song plays low on the radio...static...then...BOOM. THUNDER
          roars scaring Mike and literally shaking the Audi. SPLASH.
          RAIN drops in buckets.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Jesus!
          
          Mike turns the wipers on high. Not much help. He slows the
          car to a crawl, straining to see out the windshield.
          
          LIGHTNING flashes. We see the Janitor leaning over the
          railing looking into the raging river. Mike brakes, throws
          his door open, jumps out into the pouring rain.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
          
                                 MIKE
                    Hey!?     Get away from there!?
          
                                                                    16.
          
          
          
          Mike, blinded by the rain makes his way to the railing. The
          Janitor's GONE.
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Oh no!!   Hello!?
          
          Mike leans over the rickety railing, looks down...
          
          The phosphorescent water swirls angrily...rising quickly.
          It's mesmerizing. Magical. Mike can't take his eyes off-
          
          LIGHTENING FLASHES Mike's 17 year-old face reflection stares
          back up at him.
          
                                MIKE (CONT'D)
                    What the-
          
          CRACK. The railing BREAKS.    Mike FALLS...SPLASH...headlong
          into the river.

          EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
          
          Mike's Audi rolls into the driveway. The door swings open.
          A muddy, shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but
          in no better shape.
          
          WE follow the feet, tattered slacks dragging on the cement,
          to the door. 2 filthy hands dig into pockets, searching-
          
                              MIKE
                    Damn it.
                        (pushes doorbell)
                    Ed! Ed! I lost my key!
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Ed, wrapped in a robe, tissue between his toes, wobbles to
          the door so as not to mess up his freshly polished nails.
          
                               ED
                    Coming!   I've been worried sick!
                    WHERE-
          
          Ed opens the door...standing before him is Mike, covered in
          MUD. His ripped, grimy suit now hangs off of him
          because...HE'S 17 AGAIN.
          
          Ed's eyes widen with FEAR.
          
                                                                 17.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    I've had a really rough night.
          
                              ED
                    AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
          
          Ed slams the door, frantically wobbles away. The door opens,
          ANGLE ON the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of
          cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door.
          
          
          INT. BATHROOM - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON Ed cowering against the back wall, brandishing an
          over-sized loofah. The door slowly swings open. Ed gasps-
          
                              ED
                    Don't come any closer!    I'll use
                    it!
          
                              MIKE
                    What are you gonna do? Exfoliate
                    me to death?
                        (Ed shrieks)
                    You got into my samples case again,
                    didn't you?
          
          A whimpering Ed points to the mirror.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    What's your problem, it's only mud.
          
          The muddy feet turn toward the mirror and-
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
          
          ANGLE ON the mirror. Mike's 17. He turns on the water,
          splashes his face frantically. Mud gone. He's still 17.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
          
          Mike tears his suit jacket and shirt off...hairless chest.
          He yanks off his pants, peeks down his boxers-
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I'm dreaming right? Is this some
                    kind of hallucination?
          
          Mike pulls Ed up by his robe.
          
                                                                    18.

                    Do something! Anything!    Pinch me!
          
          Ed throws a knee into Mike's nuts, bolts out the door
          SCREAMING. Mike crumbles.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I said pinch!
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/FOYER - DAY
          
          Ed reaches the door, fumbles with the locks. He just manages
          to open the door when Mike tackles him to the floor.
          
          The two buddies roll around, limbs intertwined.
          
                              MIKE
                    Calm down! We need to talk!     We
                    can work this out!

          They stop wrestling, look up.   The LATINO MAID stands in the
          doorway genuflecting.
          
                              ED
                    Maria, we're just friends.   Really.
          
          The Maid hurries off muttering prayers in Spanish.

                    My theory is that you were
                    transformed by a freak congruence
                    of some of the planets most

          REVEAL Mike in the gurgling green water of the hot tub.
          
                              MIKE
                    Well, it obviously isn't working.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    That's because the cocktail's not
                    complete.
          
          Ed picks up a TOASTER attached to an extension cord.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    Last night we had the worst
                    electrical storm of the last
                    hundred years.
          
                              MIKE
                    Is that true?
          
                              ED
                    It was pretty bad.
          
          Ed raises the toaster-
          
                              MIKE
                    Wait!! Wait!! Wait!! Do you
                    really think this'll work?
          
                                ED
                    It could.
          
          Ed tosses it in. Mike screams.   Nothing happens.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    Oops. Came unplugged. Won't be a

          Ed reaches down to plug it in.

                    Has anyone seen the janitor? Is
                    the janitor here? Where's the
                    janitor?
          
          Mike reaches the familiar wall of pictures.    Kids point,
          laugh, stare.
          
          A FEMALE JANITOR, steps from a room.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you
                    tell me where I can find the night
                    janitor?
          
                              JANITOR
                    I'm the only custodial engineer
                    currently employed here.
          
                              MIKE
                    There was an old guy, white hair.
                    I showed him this picture of me-
          
          Mike points to the 1989 team photo.
          
                               JANITOR
                    -Of you?   That picture's from 1989.
          
          Mike backs away from the picture and the Janitor.
          
                               MIKE
                    Right.   Forget it.
          
          Confused, Mike stumbles to the bathroom. He's about to enter,
          three letter jacket wearing JOCKS, STAN, JAZZ and KEVIN,
          burst out laughing, knocking Mike on the way by.

                              VOICE (o.s.)
                    Can I get a little help in here?
          
          Mike turns, sees what appears to be UNDERWEAR stretched over
          the corner of a closed stall door.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          
          Mike approaches the door, swings it open...there HANGS Alex,
          sneakers dangling 3 feet off the ground. The back of his
          underwear wrenched up over the corner of the door.
          
                               MIKE
                    Alex?   What are you doing up there?
          
                              ALEX
                    I wanted to see if I could get my
                    nuts into my esophagus. What do
                    you think I'm doing!? Get me down!

                    Okay.   Okay. I'll get you down.
          
          Mike pulls the underwear off the door.   Alex drops, reaches
          down his pants, adjusts his underwear.

                               MIKE
                    But why?
          
                              ALEX
                    Because they can and so they do on
                    a daily basis.
          
                              MIKE
                        (SHOCKED)
                    But you're one of them.
          
                              ALEX
                    No, I'm not. Nice robe, guy. Gotta
                    go.
          
          Alex walks out bowlegged.   A devastated Mike watches him go.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          
          
          INT. AUDI - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Mike drives off out of the parking lot. To his left he spies-
          ANGLE ON: Stan and Maggie making out against Stan's Mustang.
          
          Mike pounds on the horn, scaring them apart.   Drive's off.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Ed sits at the island, a laptop in front of him. On the
          screen WE see he's perusing www.spellscursesincantations.com.
          
          The sound of the front door opening and closing. Mike enters.
          
                              ED
                    Did you find the janitor?
          
                              MIKE
                    He doesn't exist.   Nothing makes
                    sense.
          
                              ED
                    Did he ask you for your soul?
          
                              MIKE
                    No?
          
                              ED
                    That's a good sign. We can
                    eliminate Satan.
                        (clicks on a link)
                    I think what we're dealing with
                    here is a spell of enlightenment.
                        (peruses the page)
                    "Spell affect"..."casting
                    procedure"...yada, yada, yada.
                    Basically it's a learning spell.
                    There's something you need to
                    figure out and until you do you'll
                    stay a kid. My guess is that
                    janitor was probably a war...
          
                              MIKE
                    ...I'm going back to high school.
          
                              ED
                    ...lock. I'm sorry. Could you
                    repeat that? Because I thought you
                    just said you were-
          
                                                                 23.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    Going back to high school.
          
          Mike grabs a beer from the fridge, cracks it. As Mike is
          about to take a sip, Ed swipes the beer from his hand...CHUGS
          it down.
          
                              ED
                    Are you out of your freaking mind!?
          
                              MIKE
                    My son was hanging by his underwear
                    from a bathroom stall door and my
                    daughter was being mauled by a
                    smarmy gorilla. They need me.
          
                              ED
                    What about your job?
          
                              MIKE
                    Email and telephone.   I got it
                    covered.
          
                              ED
                    Well, Scarlet, then.   What are you
                    gonna tell her?
          
                               MIKE
                    Nothing.
          
                              ED
                    You're just gonna disappear?
          
                              MIKE
                    To be honest, I think she'd rather
                    have it that way. What's with the
                    attitude?
          
                              ED
                    Because I know you're going to suck
                    me into this and I'm not going back
                    there, Mike. You'll never get me
                    to go back to Fitch. Never!
          
                                                            CUT TO:

                              ED
                    I hate you.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Ed and Mike sit outside Principal's
          office. Mike is dressed in an overly exaggerated hip style,
          (a grown-ups concept of what's cool- he looks ridiculous).
          
                                MIKE
                      Take a deep breath. All you have to
                      do is enroll me and say as little
                      as possible.
          
          Ed calms.   Mike pulls a manila folder out of his book bag.
          
                                MIKE (CONT'D)
                      Are you sure these look legit?
          
                                ED
                          (offended/cocky)
                      Please. I created software used to
                      launch the space shuttle. I think
                      I'm capable of forging some report
                      cards. What's up with the gear?
          
                                MIKE
                      This is hip teenage apparel. I got
                      it right off the mannequin at Ed
                      Hardy.
          
                                SECRETARY
                      Ms. Goodwin will see you now.
          
          Mike and Ed stand, head for the door marked `Principal'.
          
                                ED
                      First sign this old hag is on to us
                      I'M-
          
          Mike and Ed step through the door-
          
          
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          MS. GOODWIN, 35, sits behind her desk...she's no hag. She's
          an attractive, buttoned-up professional.
          
          Ed's face lights up and without missing a beat-
          
                                ED
                      -so glad we chose this school.   I'm
                      Ed Freedman.
          
          Ed steps in front of Mike, shakes Ms. Goodwin's hand.
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          
                              JULIE
                    Nice to meet you. I'm Julie
                    Goodwin, principal here at Fitch
                    Senior High. And you behind there?
                    You are?
          
          Mike tries to peer around Ed.   Mike finally physically moves
          Ed steps aside.
          
                              ED
                    Oh, right. Sorry. This little
                    chicken pock here is Mark. Say
                    hello, Mark.
          
          Ed smiles, rubs Mikes head vigorously.   Mike slaps his hand.
          
                              MIKE
                    Nice to meet you, Julie.
          
                              JULIE
                    Around here you're going to have to
                    use Ms. Goodwin. Please, sit.
          
          Mike and Ed sit.
          
                              ED
                    Before we get started I want you to
                    know that Mark's a bastard.
          
                              JULIE
                    Excuse me!?
          
                              ED
                    I had him out of wedlock.   So the
                    answer is yes, I'm very
                    single...and very rich.
          
                              MIKE
                    Dad met mom in Thailand. She's a
                    very successful prostitute.
          
          Ed's smile fades.
          
                              JULIE
                    O-Kay. Did you bring your
                    transcripts?
          
          Mike hands Julie the folder. As Julie browses through it, Ed
          and Mike get into a pinching, elbowing fight. When she looks
          up, the friends stop. Both smiling.
          
                                                                   26.
          
          
          
                              JULIE (CONT'D)
                    So the last school you went to was
                    Cutler High in Connecticut. And
                    you were a straight A student.
                    Very impressive.
          
                              ED
                    I help him with his homework...a
                    lot.
          
                              MIKE
                    Oh, dad, the doctor called.     You
                    were right. It is herpes.
          
          Ed's jaw drops.   Julie rises abruptly.
          
                              JULIE
                    I think it's time we got Mark to
                    class. Lisa! Lisa!
          
          The door opens, in steps LISA, 18.
          
                              JULIE (CONT'D)
                    Lisa, will you print out a schedule
                    for Mark and show him to class?
          
                               LISA
                    Sure.   Come on, Mark.
          
          Mike stands.   Ed addresses him as fatherly as he knows how-
          
                              ED
                    Be a good boy now.   And sit up
                    straight.
          
          Mike glares at Ed, follows Lisa out.    Ed turns to Julie.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    They grow up so fast. Mojito?
          
                              JULIE
                    I beg your pardon.
          
                               ED
                    You strike me as a Mojito gal. I
                    know this little Cuban place, great
                    PLANTAINS-
          
                              JULIE
                    -Yeah, no. I don't date my
                    students' parents. It's a rule of
                    mine.
          
                                                                   27.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    I'll enroll him somewhere else.
          
                              JULIE
                    I really need to get back to work.
          
          Julie ushers Ed to the door.
          
                              ED
                    See you at the next bake sale then?
          
          Julie shuts the door, shakes her head in disbelief.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY
          
          Mike steps in. Scattered giggles at his appearance. Mike
          takes a seat, eyes three sexy girls wearing next to nothing,
          SAMANTHA, LAUREN and JAMIE, busy texting on their phones.
          
                               MIKE
                    Do their mothers know they dress
                    like that?
          
          A GIRL next to him leans over-
          
                              GIRL
                    Those are the Wonder Bras.    Beware.
          
          The Jocks, Stan, Jazz and Kevin strut in. Mike's eyes
          narrow. Stan stops before Mike, looks him up and down-
          
                              STAN
                    What did you did do? Mug the
                    mannequin at the Ed Hardy store?
          
                              JAZZ
                    Tool!
          
          Laughter from the class. Mike shies. The Jocks sit, Stan
          behind Mike. Just as the last bell rings, Maggie rushes in,
          sits with the Bras.

                    Oh thank God he's not here.    I ran
                    all the way from-
          
          Something catches Maggie's eye.   It's Mike waving to her.
          
                              MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    Why's that freak waving at me.
          
          Maggie places a hand over her face, looks down.
          
                                                                 28.
          
          
          
                              MALE VOICE (o.s.)
                    Take your seats. Stop the talking.
          
          MR. ADAMS, 45, prissy, strides in carrying a stack of papers.
          
                              MR. ADAMS
                    Here are yesterday's tests.    Let's
                    see how you all did.
          
          Moans from the class. Adams walks up and down the aisle
          slapping them down on the desks..
          
                              MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)
                    C-, C, B-, D, D-, F
          
          Adams reaches Maggie, drops the test on her desk...
          
                              MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)
                    D for O'Donnell.
          
          Humiliated, Maggie lowers her head.
          
                              MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)
                    Let me guess. Early acceptance?
                        (Maggie nods)
                    Where are we going?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Georgetown.
          
                              MR. ADAMS
                    If you flunk senior calculus you'll
                    be lucky to get into beauty school,
                    missy. So, if you plan on slacking
                    your way through my class, don't.
                    Save your parents tuition money and
                    pick up a blow dryer...
          
          Mike angrily stands-
          
                                 MIKE
                    Enough!
          
          Mr. Adams turns to Mike.
          
                                 MR. ADAMS
                    Excuse me?
          
                              MIKE
                    Do you think humiliating a 17 year-
                    old in front of her peers is
                    helpful or do you just get off on
                    it?
          
                                                                   29.
          
          
          
                              MR. ADAMS
                    And you are?
          
                              MIKE
                    Mark Freedman. It's my first day.
          
          Adams turns, walks back towards the front of the room.
          
                              MR. ADAMS
                    Well, Mr. Freedman-
          
          Stan signals his friends, takes out a LIGHTER, flicks it,
          leans forward and places the flame BETWEEN Mike's legs.
          
          The flame GLOWS RED against Mike's jeans.   The Jocks and Bras
          pull out their cells and begin VIDEOING.
          
          Adams scribbles on a pad-
          
                              MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)
                    -you've earned yourself a trip to
                    the principal's office. Welcome to
                    Fitch.
          
          Adams rips the paper off, holds it out towards Mike.   Mike
          sniffs at the air-
          
                               MIKE
                    Is someone barbecuing?
                        (BEAT)
                    YYYYEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!
          
          Mike LEAPS out of his shoes. A FLAME runs up his crotch.
          LAUGHTER. Mike, SCREAMING, runs around the room fanning his
          package.
          
                              MR. ADAMS
                    Get out, Mr. Freedman!
          
          Mike snatches the slip from Adams and out the door.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          A packed lunchroom. The CLIQUES sit amongst themselves. WE
          notice all the KIDS hunched over STARING AT THEIR PHONES.
          
          Mike enters carrying a bag lunch. A BLACK BURN MARK on the
          crotch of his pants. A GAYSIAN spots him, yells-
          
                              GAYSIAN
                    Go Hot Pants! Do your dance, Girl!
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
          
          The entire cafeteria turns to Mike and erupts in laughter.
          
          As Mike passes each table, WE see the kids are watching his
          `fire dance' on their phones.
          
          Mike approaches a table of the 3 BIGGEST LOSERS in school,
          unkempt hair, fat, acne. Mike begins to sit when-
          
                              BIGGEST LOSER
                    Look, we feel your pain. We really
                    do. But life's hard enough,
                    Brother.
          
          Mike nods, continues on past the snickering and catcalls
          until he sees Maggie and the Wonder Bras.
          
          ANGLE: Wonder Bra Table. Maggie, Samantha, Jamie and Lauren
          pick around plates of cafeteria food.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    What's the big deal? He stuck up
                    for me in class. It was a nice
                    thing to do.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    He was totally sexing on you.
          
                              LAUREN
                    He's coming. Pretend you're not
                    here.
          
          Mike approaches, big smile. The Wonder Bras look off in
          every direction except Mike's.
          
                              MIKE
                    Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls.     I'm Mark-
          
          The Girls continue looking away, ignoring Mike.
          
                                MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Girls?    Hello? Anyone home?
          
                                 LAUREN
                    Oh my God.     Can't you see we're not
                    here?
          
                                MIKE
                    Good.    So there's plenty of room
                    then.
          
          Mike drops down next to Samantha and across from Maggie.
          
                                                                 31.
          
          
          
                              JAMIE
                    Oh, look. He brought a bag lunch.
                    How sped. (special ed)
          
          Mike hides his lunch.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    Look, this table is V.I.P.     You're
                    a NIP.
          
                              MIKE
                    What's a NIP?
          
                              LAUREN
                    Not Important. Go away.
          
                              MIKE
                    Maggie, why are you friends with
                    these horrible girls?
          
                               MAGGIE
                    Listen, I appreciate what you did
                    in class but, I already have a
                    boyfriend.
          
                              MIKE
                    You have a boyfriend?
                        (his phone rings)
                    Excuse me a second.
          
          Mike pulls out an OLDER Blackberry phone, looks at the caller
          ID...Scarlet. He sends it to voice mail.
          
                              JAMIE
                    He still gets calls.    How 2007.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    I think my grandfather has that
                    phone.
          
                              MIKE
                    Maggie, could we talk somewhere
                    ELSE-
          
          The sound of a bouncing ball interrupts.
          
                               MALE VOICE (o.s.)
                    Yo!
          
          Mike turns.   Stan, Jazz and Kevin swagger over.
          
                                                                  32.
          
          
          
                              STAN
                    Bro-ski, what are you doing at our
                    table?
          
                               MAGGIE
                    Nothing.   He was just leaving.
          
          Maggie nods for Mike to go.
          
                              MIKE
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    We should do this again sometime.
          
          Mike stands. Stan pulls Maggie up, starts making out with
          her, hands all over her. WE can see Mike's blood BOIL until-
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Get your hands off her, you little
                    punk!
          
          Oops. Stan stops groping, steps over to Mike, a solid foot
          taller than him.
          
                              STAN
                    You gotta problem with me, `bra?
          
          Mike looks around...the entire cafeteria watches.   Defeated-
          
                              MIKE
                    No, no, I don't.
          
          Stan takes Mike's hat off, picks up an ice cream from
          Maggie's tray, puts the ice cream in the hat, places it back
          on Mike's head and SMUSHES it down.
          
                              STAN
                    Now make like Tom and Cruise.
          
          Flush with humiliation and ice cream dripping down his face,
          Mike turns and walks out.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    That was so not cool.
          
                             STAN
                    What? I'll buy you another ice
                    cream.
          
          WE see Alex, seated by himself at a back table, shake his
          head in disgust.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT
          
          A beaten down Mike sits alongside Ed at the bar.
          
                              MIKE
                    It was terrible. The place is
                    evil, Ed. That building needs to
                    be exorcised.
          
                              ED
                    Come on. It couldn't have been
                    that bad.
          
                              MIKE
                    My beanbag was lit on fire, videoed
                    and sent to every member of student
                    body.
          
                              ED
                    Yeah, I caught it on youtube.
                    Funny stuff.
          
                              MIKE
                    They mocked my clothes and phone.
                    My daughter got a tongue bath in
                    front of me and I have mint chip in
                    my ears.
          
                              ED
                    High school's great, isn't it?
          
          The BARTENDER approaches.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What can I get you?
          
                              MIKE
                    Double scotch neat.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Funny, kid.
          
                              ED
                    Get the boy a Shirley Temple.
                    Extra cherries.
          
          The Bartender nods serves up the drinks.   Mike miserably
          plucks a cherry off his pink drink.
          
                              MIKE
                    I'm not going back there.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    Mike, you're an adult sitting on 36
                    years of experience. You should be
                    dominating these kids, ripping
                    their hearts out.
          
          An OLDER WOMAN takes a seat next to the boys.
          
                              MIKE
                    I know why you're encouraging me
                    all of a sudden.
          
                              ED
                    Because I'm a supportive dad.
          
                               MIKE
                    Because you want to nail my
                    principal.
          
                              ED
                    Did she ask about me?
          
                              MIKE
                    She's not your type. She's smart.
          
                              ED
                    As far as I can tell that's her
                    only flaw. I need a reason to see
                    her again. You could flunk your
                    classes, start a fight, vandalise
                    the place. You'll figure it out.
                    Then I can rush in, a teary eyed,
                    helpless, single dad who can't
                    handle his angry, kitten killing
                    son. What do you think?
          
          The Older Lady, having listened to it all, turns to Ed-
          
                              OLDER LADY
                    I think you should be reported to
                    child services!
          
                              ED
                    Mind your business, Lady.   This is
                    a family matter.
          
          The Lady turns away in disgust.
          
                              MIKE
                    I can't do it. I don't have it in
                    me.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    Hey, no sweat off my sack. Tell
                    Alex to stop wearing underwear all
                    together. He'll be fine. That's
                    what I did.
          
          Mike eyes Ed, considers just how "well adjusted" Ed is. A
          determined look comes over Mike. He pounds the bar.
          
                              MIKE
                    You're right! My kids need me.
          
                              ED
                    At'a boy. Now what you need is a
                    crash course on being a teen in
                    2008.
          
          A MONTAGE OF MIKE'S CRASH COURSE
          
          
          EXT. MAGAZINE STAND - NIGHT
          
          The Boys gather a stack of TEEN MAGAZINES and TABLOID RAGS.
          Ed slips a MELONS Magazine into the pile.
          
          
          INT. TRENDY HAIR SALON - NIGHT
          
          A picture of a YOUNG, POPULAR STAR torn from one of the teen
          mags hangs on the mirror.
          
          A HAIRDRESSER cuts away and highlights Mike's long locks.     Ed
          sits beside Mike sipping wine, enjoying a manicure.
          
          
          INT. TRENDY CLOTHES STORE - NIGHT
          
          It's the PRETTY WOMAN scene. 2 hip SALESGIRLS pull clothes
          from racks. A clean cut Mike tries on sneakers, jeans, T-
          shirts, hoodies, shirts, jewelry. Ed nods with his approval
          or disapproval.
          
          At the register, the Girls hand Mike his bags of clothes.     Ed
          takes out his cell to put their numbers in it. The Girls
          frown and go back to work.
          
          
          INT. VIRGIN MEGA MUSIC STORE - NIGHT
          
          Mike and Ed stand before the wall of 100 top albums.   Both
          wear headphones listening and moving to the music.
          
                                                                   36.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Mike and Ed, surrounded by the magazines and music discs, sit
          before the computer. Ed TEACHES Mike how to create a MYSPACE
          page.
          
          Bogus About Me and Interests. Photoshopped pictures of Mike
          in exotic locations. All the `now' movies, music and books.
          They fill his Friends section with only hot girls.
          
          The Boys view the flashy, finished product, tap fists.   This
          page makes `Mark Freedman' look like a playboy.
          
          
          INT. MAC STORE - NIGHT
          
          A SALESMAN hands a smiling Mike his new iPhone.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mike sits on the bed, types away on his laptop. A knock on
          the door. Mike looks up and YELLS. Ed stands in the
          doorway, his entire body and head wrapped in SEAWEED.
          
                              ED
                    Before you ask, it's a seaweed
                    wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as
                    losing an inch or 2 from my problem
                    areas.
          
                              MIKE
                    There must be a very hot girl
                    downstairs.
          
                                ED
                    There is.    What are you doing?
          
                              MIKE
                    I forwarded my calls to my new
                    phone, sent some work emails and
                    just lobbed one to Scarlet, told
                    her I was in Peru finding myself.
                    Think she'll buy it?
          
                              ED
                    Probably not because when she
                    called earlier I told her you were
                    being detained at Guantanamo.
                    Ready for tomorrow?
          
                                                                      37.
          
          
          
                               MIKE
                     I am so ready.
          
          Ed flips Mike a set of keys.     Mike's eyes light up.
          
                               ED
                     That ought'a put you over the top.
                     And don't forget to hook me up son.
          
          Ed plods off.   Off Mike's huge smile.
          
          
          EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - MORNING
          
          The usual pre-school ritual. Stan, Jazz, Kevin, the Wonder
          Bras and Maggie all hang around Stan's `stang.
          
          Stan and Maggie wrapped in a heated embrace, kissing.
          
          HONK.   A horn blares.    Stan and Maggie jump out of the way.
          
          An ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH stops next to the crew. The tinted
          window rolls down revealing the new and improved Mike.
          
          Mike winks then rolls on past.
          
                                  SAMANTHA
                     Oh my god.     Was that-
          
                               JAMIE
                     Did you see-
          
                               LAUREN
                     I told you he was cute.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY
          
          It's the MOMENT.   Mike walks the hallway, handsome and hip.
          
          Samantha, Lauren and Jamie text by their lockers.    Mike
          struts up to them. The Bras smile.
          
                               MIKE
                     So I've been here a couple days now
                     and I think I got it figured out.
                     You girls are lesbians, right?
          
          The Bras' jaws hit the floor. Mike walks off, a huge grin on
          his face. Man, that felt good.
          
                                                                 38.
          
          
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Mike steps from the kitchen area carrying a TRAY, scans the
          crowded room, finds Alex seated at a table ALONE. It's a
          heartbreaking image. Mike approaches-
          
                              MIKE
                    Mind if I sit here?
          
                                ALEX
                    Mark?    You look totally different.
          
          Mike sits across from Alex.
          
                              MIKE
                    I got rid of the bull's eye on my
                    forehead.
          
                              ALEX
                    Could you move to the left a
                    little?
          
          Mike inches left, peeks behind him...2 girls eat lunch
          together. The one facing them is a cute Latino, NICOLE, 16.
          
          Nicole smiles.    Alex quickly shies away.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Who's she?
          
                              ALEX
                    Nicole Lopez. She's in my Spanish
                    class.
          
                              MIKE
                    Have you spoken to her?
          
                             ALEX
                    No. I get all stupid so I just
                    stare.
          
                              MIKE
                    I'll tell you a funny story. The
                    first time I met your mother I was
                    so nervous-
          
                                 ALEX
                    My mother?
          
                                 MIKE
                    What?
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          
                              ALEX
                    You said, `the first time I met
                    your mother I was so nervous...'
          
                                MIKE
                    I did?    That's weird.   Is your mom
                    hot?
          
                                ALEX
                    Dude.
          
                              MIKE
                    What's going on tonight?    You wanna
                    hang out? Do something?
          
                                ALEX
                    Really?
          
                              MIKE
                    Yeah you could show me around.
          
                                ALEX
                    Cool.
          
          The Wonder Bras sway in, take seats at the VIP table.
          
                              MIKE
                    I'll swing by your house around 7.
          
          Mike rises.
          
                              ALEX
                    I wouldn't go over there. Stan and
                    his Baboons have lunch this period.
          
                              MIKE
                    Don't worry. I'll see you tonight.
          
          Mike strolls over to the Bras' table, plunks himself down.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Did you girls catch Ellen
                    yesterday? Rosie was on. Melissa
                    Etheridge jammed-
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    -You're so rude!? We're not gay.
                    We like boys.
          
                              JAMIE
                    Yeah, Samantha's a total slu...
          
          Samantha's jaw drops.
          
                                                                 40.
          
          
          
                              LAUREN
                    Last New Year's Samantha made it
                    with my boyfriend.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    I was on like 5 Red Bulls! I can't
                    believe you keep bringing that up.
          
          The Bras' begin to bicker amongst themselves. Mike pulls out
          his new iPhone, plugs the earphones in his ears.
          
          The Bras immediately stop bickering, ogle the phone.
          
                                 JAMIE
                    Rad phone.
          
                              MIKE
                    I know. I'll text you...NOT.
                    Later...much.
          
          Mike rises from the table.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    Like we'd ever give you our
                    numbers.
          
          Stan, carrying a basketball, his goons and Maggie come up
          behind Mike.
          
                                 STAN
                    Heads up!
          
          Stan whips the ball at Mike. Mike, cat-quick, spins around,
          catches the ball.
          
          The whole cafeteria turns their attention on Mike and Stan.
          Mike points to the name `Stan' on Stan's letter jacket, reads-
          
                              MIKE
                    Stan. Did mommy sew that on there
                    so you wouldn't forget your name?
          
          Laughter from the Students.
          
                              STAN
                    You think `cause you got a haircut
                    and new clothes people'd forget
                    what a fag you are?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Cut it out, Stan.    Let's eat.
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
                              STAN
                    Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch.
          
          Mike ignores him and starts dribbling.
          
                              MIKE
                    You know, Stan, I feel sorry for
                    you.
          
                              STAN
                    You don't know me.
          
          Mike speaks loudly now, playing to the cafeteria.
          
                              MIKE
                    Oh but I do. All too well. You're
                    the man. Captain of the basketball
                    team. Dates the pretty girls.
                    High school is your kingdom.
          
          Stan and his Posse tap fists. Mike dribbles between his legs.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    But, People, Stan's a bully. Why?
                    It would be way too easy to say
                    Stan preys on the weak because he's
                    simply a dick. No, Stan's more
                    complex than that. According to
                    leading psychiatrists Stan is a
                    bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under
                    all that male bravado there's an
                    insecure little girl banging on the
                    closet door trying to get out. 2,
                    like a caveman, Stan's brain is
                    underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is
                    unable to use self-control so he
                    acts out aggressively. And the
                    third reason-
          
          Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I'd argue that Stan suffers from
                    all 3.
          
          The entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY.
          
          Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then
          gently rolls the ball back to Stan.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                        (WINKS)
                    Don't hurt yourself big boy.
          
                                                                    42.

          Mike with new found lust.
          
          ANGLE ON Mike's face as he walks away.
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                        (to himself)
                    3, 2, 1...
          
          Mike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead, rockets across
          the cafeteria landing on Miss Goodwin's tray, splattering her
          with food. She glares at Stan.
          
          Mike's iphone buzzes...ANGLE ON SCREEN: the Wonder Bras
          digits appear.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE CENTER - DAY
          
          Mike enters, approaches MRS. MENCER, 60.
          
                              MIKE
                    My guidance councilor made me come,
                    but just so you know I'm not
                    planning on going to college.
          
                              MRS. MENCER
                    A lot of kids feel that way. Don't
                    be intimidated. It doesn't hurt to
                    take a look.
          
          Mrs. Mencer hands Mike a hefty book.
          
                              MRS. MENCER (CONT'D)
                    A good place to start is here...
                    this book has information on every
                    college and university in the
                    country.
          
                              MIKE
                    Thanks.
          
          Mike sits, starts paging through the book and gets lost in
          the bright colored pictures...smiling STUDENTS, CAMPUSES and
          LECTURE HALLS...THE OPTIONS HE LOST YEARS AGO.
          
          
          INT. ASTON MARTIN - NIGHT
          
          A pumped-up Mike dials...ringing. On the seat beside him
          rests a stack of college applications. Ed answers.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          
                              ED (o.s.)
                    Hello?
          
                              MIKE
                    It was incredible! I was
                    incredible! You should'a seen me!
                    I humiliated Stan in front of the
                    entire lunchroom. Everyone was
                    clapping. The popular girls were
                    begging to give me their numbers!
          
                              ED
                    See what happens when you put a
                    little lipstick on the pig? Did you
                    manage to get sent to the
                    principal's office?
          
                              MIKE
                    Man, I feel great! I even shot some
                    hoops after school. No aches. No
                    pains. Gotta run, Buddy.
          
          Mike hangs up.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The Aston Martin pulls up. Mike climbs out, walks to the
          door, takes a deep breath and rings the bell.
          
                              SCARLET (o.s.)
                    Coming!
          
          The door opens revealing Scarlet in her dirty yard attire.
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    I've been dying to meet you. I've
                    known your father since...(gasps)
          
          Scarlet...SPEECHLESS...visibly stunned by the resemblance...
          
                              MIKE
                    Is something wrong?
          
                              SCARLET
                        (FLUSTERED)
                    No. It's just...you look
                    like...No. I'm fine. Come in.
                    Please.
          
                                                                 44.
          
          
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Scarlet and Mike sit across from one another. Scarlet stares
          at Mike as if examining every pore on his face.
          
                              SCARLET
                    And you say Ed Freedman is your
                    father?
          
                              MIKE
                    That's my dad. All 68 inches of
                    him.
          
                              SCARLET
                    You don't look anything like him.
                    If you don't mind me asking, who's
                    your mother?
          
                              MIKE
                    My mother...she...she was...a...
          
          Mike spies Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment on a table.
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    -a convict. In New Jersey. They
                    met while dad was at Princeton.
                    She was on parole. B&E, fist
                    fighting, shanking. Nothing major.
                    But she's dead now.
          
                               SCARLET
                    Oh?   I'm sorry.
          
                              MIKE
                    I warned her about kite surfing
                    during hurricane season. So how
                    are things with you? Doing
                    anything exciting? Dating?
                    Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe?
          
                              SCARLET
                    Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed
                    tell you to say that?
          
                              MIKE
                    I mean do what you want. You're a
                    grown woman but, word on the street
                    is Dom's been spreading gingivitis
                    all over town.
          
                              SCARLET
                    I'll keep that in mind, Mark.
          
                                                                   45.
          
          
          
          Scarlet can't take her eyes off Mike.
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    It's crazy how much you like my
                    husband when he was a teenager.
          
          Mike switches subjects, points to her dirty clothes-
          
                              MIKE
                    You doing some gardening?
          
                              SCARLET
                    I am. I'm a landscape designer.
                    I'm actually redoing the backyard.
                    I'll show you.
          
          Scarlet stands, leads Mike to the french doors.
          
                               SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    It's a work in progress so you'll
                    have to use your imagination some.
          
          Scarlet opens the doors, flips on the lights. The yard's
          been cleaned up. Fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to
          stacks of limestone. HUNDREDS of unplanted plants, flowers,
          trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Mike and Scarlet step outside.
          
                              MIKE
                    I almost don't even recognize
                    it...er...if I had seen it before I
                    probably wouldn't recognize it.
          
                              SCARLET
                    You wouldn't have. It was a
                    disaster back here a few days ago.
                    Obviously I have a lot to do still.
                    I'm laying the sod next and the
                    limestone pathway will go here.
          
          Scarlet moves about the yard, pointing and explaining.
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    Then I'll plant all those, over a
                    hundred different types of flowers
                    and plants. I have an amazing
                    fountain being delivered that'll go
                    here and a bench over there.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                46.
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    And I'll string rows of tiny, white
                    lights above it all so every night
                    will be a starry one. It'll be a
                    real sanctuary back here.
          
                              MIKE
                    It seems like a lot'a work for one
                    person, Scar.
          
          A chill runs up Scarlet's spine.
          
                              SCARLET
                    My husband's the only one that ever
                    calls me that.
          
          Alex appears at the doors interrupting-
          
                                ALEX
                    Yo, Mark.    Let's do this.
          
                              MIKE
                    Good luck with the project.
          
                              SCARLET
                    Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be
                    home by 10:30.
          
          Mike heads back inside.   Scarlet stares after him.

          Mike and Alex step in.
          
                              MIKE
                    How's your mom doing? You know,
                    with your dad not being around and
                    all.
          
                              ALEX
                    She doesn't like to show it but I
                    know she's bummed. I think it
                    bothers her more that he hasn't
                    called me or Maggie in a while.
                    Whatever.
          
          BEEP. BEEP. Mike pulls out his iPhone, text message from
          Samantha. It reads:
          
                             SAMANTHA'S TEXT
                    Wat^? mobinit 2 zuma. soi! but

                                                                   47.
          
          
          
          Mike stares at the screen as if it were in hieroglyphics.
          
                              MIKE
                    I have no idea what this says?
          
          Alex takes the phone from Mike, reads-
          
                              ALEX
                    It says `What up? Mobbing it to
                    Zuma. So over it but whatever. Be
                    right back. Back. Got to go.
                    Talk to you later. kiss, hug. Sam.
          
                              MIKE
                    Let's hit the beach, wingman.
          
          The two touch fists.
          
          
          EXT. ZUMA BEACH - NIGHT
          
          A BONFIRE illuminates the night sky. MUSIC plays. KIDS lay
          on blankets, play football. Others splash in the ocean.
          
          WE find Maggie and the Wonder Bras seated by the fire.
          
                               SAMANTHA
                    We were on his myspace page.
                    There's a picture of him jamming
                    with the Chili Peppers at
                    Coachella.
          
                              JAMIE
                    I heard Timbaland wants to produce
                    an album with him.
          
                              LAUREN
                    Yeah, but he turned him down to
                    help orphans with Brangelina in
                    Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa.
          
                                 SAMANTHA
                    Oh my God!     I bet he knows Justin.
          
          ANGLE: Mike and a nervous Alex make their way down the sand.
          
                              ALEX
                    This looks boring. Let's go back
                    to my house and play video games.
          
          Alex turns.   Mike grabs his arm, turns him back.
          
                                                                     48.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    What are you so nervous about?
          
                              ALEX
                    The beach is for the older, cool
                    kids. I don't belong here.
          
                              MIKE
                    What are you talking about? You're
                    a basketball player. You're cool.
          
                              ALEX
                    I don't play basketball. I mean, I
                    can play, I just don't play on the
                    team.
          
          Mike is stunned.
          
                              MIKE
                    But I thought you were getting
                    ready for the season?
          
                              ALEX
                    I never told you that.
          
          As a confused Mike and Alex approach the scene, BOYS call out
          to Mike, tap his fist. GIRLS fawn over him. Mike's become a
          celebrity...and he's eating it up.
          
          ANGLE: Lauren spots Mike with Alex.
          
                              LAUREN
                    Here he comes!
          
          The Bras whip their heads around, get all dreamy.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Can he be any lamer? Using my
                    little brother to get to me?
          
                               SAMANTHA
                    If that boy was an apple he'd be
                    delicious.
          
          Samantha leaps up, scurries over to Mike.      Lauren and Jamie
          chase after her. Maggie shakes her head.
          
          As Mike and Alex approach the gathering, Alex freezes up.
          
                               ALEX
                    Oh, man.   It's her.   She's here.
          
                                                                  49.
          
          
          
                               MIKE
                    Who?
          
          Alex nods towards the fire.   Seated with FRIENDS is Nicole.
          Alex BELCHES loudly.
          
                              ALEX
                    She's so pretty it makes me gassy.
          
                              MIKE
                    Calm down. Here's what you're
                    gonna do. You're gonna go over
                    there and introduce yourself-
          
                              ALEX
                    She won't like me, Mark.   I'm a
                    loser.
          
          Mike grabs Alex by the shoulders.
          
                               MIKE
                    Why? Because Stan says so? You
                    think Stan's a winner? He's going
                    nowhere. You're a great kid. Any
                    girl would be lucky to get your
                    attention.
          
                               ALEX
                    Really?
          
                              MIKE
                    Really. And right now, there's a
                    girl over there who's dying to meet
                    you.
          
          A determined look comes over Alex.
          
                               ALEX
                    Okay.   What do I say?
          
                              MIKE
                    Just introduce yourself. Then
                    compliment her on something she
                    never gets complimented on. Like if
                    she has big, meaty, man hands tell
                    her she should be a hand model.
                        (Alex burps nervously)
                    And don't burp on her.
          
                              ALEX
                    I can do that.
          
                                                                   50.
          
          
          
          Alex takes a deep breath, marches off just as Samantha runs
          up and throws her arms around Mike.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    You came! Why don't we take a walk
                    somewhere private and play?
          
          Jamie and Lauren rush over.
          
                              JAMIE
                    I don't think so, Sam. Mark
                    promised me a walk on the beach.
          
                              LAUREN
                    Walk with me. I've got less miles
                    on me.
          
          A full blown ARGUMENT breaks out between the Bras.    Mike sees
          Maggie sitting by the fire alone, slips out.
          
          ANGLE: Alex steps over to Nicole and suddenly loses
          confidence. As he turns to retreat, Nicole looks up-
          
                                 NICOLE
                    Hi.
          
          Alex stops, turns back around and blurts out-
          
                                 ALEX
                    Hi, Alex.     I'm Nicole.
          
          Nicole and her Friends giggle.
          
                              NICOLE
                    You don't look like a Nicole.
          
                              ALEX
                    You have big, meaty man hands.    You
                    should be a hand model.
          
          The Girls' jaws drop.    Nicole hides her hands.
          
                                 NICOLE
                    Oh my God!     Seriously!?
          
          Alex rips a huge BURP.    The Girls duck for cover.
          
                              GIRL 1
                    I think he got some on me!
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
          
                              ALEX
                    Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real
                    nervous and I've wanted to talk to
                    you for so long. And Mark told me
                    to compliment you on something you
                    never get complimented on but I
                    couldn't find anything because
                    everything's so...perfect.
          
          Nicole and her Friends MELT.
          
                              NICOLE
                    Do you want to sit down, Nicole?
          
          Nicole scoots over making room next to her.    Alex smiles.
          
          ANGLE: Mike sits down beside Maggie.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    What do you want?
          
                               MIKE
                    Stan.   Why are you dating him?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Get to the point why don't you?
          
                              MIKE
                    I'm serious. He's not a nice guy.
                    Matter of fact he's a jackass.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Don't talk about him like that.
                    You don't even know him.
          
                              MIKE
                    I know he bullies your brother.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Stan barely knows Alex exists.
                    We're moving in together after
                    graduation.
          
                              MIKE
                    Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you
                    were going to Georgetown?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    I'm going to Westwood Community
                    College. Stan and I both are.
          
          Mike loses it, leaps to his feet shouting-
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    The hell you are, Young Lady! If
                    you think I'm gonna let you throw
                    your life away on some Sleestack
                    you're crazy! I forbid you to see
                    him anymore and that's final!
          
          Maggie jumps up.   Kids all stare.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Who do you think you are!?   My
                    father?!
          
          Maggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras.
          
                              MIKE
                    Don't you walk away from me,
                    Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!
          
          Maggie and the Bras turn towards Mike and glare.   Maggie
          heads for the parking lot.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    Who's Margaret?
          
                              LAUREN
                    He doesn't even know her name.
          
                              JAMIE
                    He's so not into her.
          
          The Bras make the `text me' sign then hurry after Maggie.
          
          Mike kicks angrily at the sand and accidentally into the
          faces of a group of KIDS.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - MORNING
          
          A HOT GIRL wearing a `Lifeguard' bathing suit sits atop a
          high chair.
          
          Ed floats on a raft. A frozen drink next to him.    Scarlet
          looms over him, the 2 in a heated conversation-
          
                              SCARLET
                    I haven't heard from him in three
                    weeks. Obviously he doesn't care.
          
                                ED
                    He cares.
          
                                                                 53.
          
          
          
                              SCARLET
                    Then where is he?
          
          Mike steps from the house, sees Scarlet-
          
                              MIKE
                    What's going on?
          
                              SCARLET
                    Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping
                    something off.
          
          Scarlet tosses a manila envelope on the patio table.
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    Our court date is the 27th. If he
                    has anything to say, he can say it
                    then.
          
          Scarlet exits.
          
                              MIKE
                    What was that all about?
          
                              ED
                    That envelope contains divorce
                    papers.
          
          Mike eyes the envelope, in stunned silence.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    But what do you care? You're going
                    to college, right? Life's one big
                    panty raid for you.
          
          Mike feigns innocence.
          
                              MIKE
                    I don't know what you're talking
                    about?
          
                              ED
                    I saw the applications in your
                    room.
          
                              MIKE
                    You went through my room!?
          
                              ED
                    If you'd cleaned like I asked I
                    wouldn't have had to. You can't be
                    serious about this can you?
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
          
          Mike starts to argue then gives in-
          
                              MIKE
                    I have to face the possibility that
                    I might never turn back and if
                    that's the case, I'm going to do it
                    right this time around.
          
                              ED
                    Karmically speaking, in the next
                    life you're coming back as a
                    hemorrhoid.
          
          Mike scoffs, storms off.    Ed calls after him-
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    I'm not paying for college!
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY
          
          Mike shoves books in his locker.   Stan approaches.
          
                              STAN
                    You like her, don't you?
          
                               MIKE
                    Who?
          
                              STAN
                    My girlfriend. She told me you
                    were trashing me at the beach.
          
                              MIKE
                    Leave her alone, Stan.    She's a
                    good kid.
          
                              STAN
                    I don't know how good she is yet
                    but after I find out, she's all
                    yours.
          
          Stan walks off.   Mike slams his locker shut.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY
          
          Mike slips inside the empty classroom, slathers KRAZY GLUE
          all over Stan's DESKTOP and CHAIR.
          
          Mike sits just as the rest of the class files in. Stan kisses
          Maggie and takes his seat.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
          
          Stan leans on his desk, placing a FOREARM and a HAND on the
          sticky desktop. He catches Mike looking back at him and
          gives him a cocky wink. Mike winks back knowingly.
          
          Mike's phone beeps. He checks it...A PIX MESSAGE...3 perfect
          ASSES in tiny bikini bottoms. A wide-eyed Mike spins in his
          seat to find the Wonder Bras smiling at him.
          
          Mr. Adams enters.
          
                              MR. ADAMS
                    Settle, people.
          
          Adams scribbles a large equation on the blackboard.
          
                              MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)
                    This was your homework. Who can
                    come up here and solve this for me?
                    Anyone?
          
          Blank, uninterested faces. Scattered giggles.   Adams tosses
          the chalk angrily on his desk.
          
                              MR. ADAMS (CONT'D)
                    Not one person. Fine. Miss
                    O'Donnell. Come up here and dazzle
                    us with your brilliance.
          
          Maggie rises nervously from her seat, shuffles to the front
          of the class. As she passes Stan WE see...
          
          Stan lifts his fingers from the desktop...it's WET...he
          places his wet fingers to the tip of his nose and smells.
          
          When Stan tries to remove his fingers from his nose...they
          STICK. Stan tries to raise his other arm...STUCK.
          
                               STAN
                    Stuck!!!   I'm stuck!   My fingers!
          
          Stan stands, hunched...the CHAIR GLUED to his butt. The DESK
          ATTACHED to his forearm and his FINGERS STUCK to his nose.
          
          The Kids and Mike burst out laughing, break out their video
          phones as Stan fumbles around, dragging the desk, PANICKING.
          
                              MR. ADAMS
                    Sit down, Stan! Sit down!
          
                              STAN
                    It's glue! I'm glued to
                    everything!
          
                                                                 56.
          
          
          
          Jazz bounds out of his seat, grabs hold of Stan's wrist.
          
                              JAZZ
                    I'll get it off!
          
                                 STAN
                    No!    No!   Don't pull--!
          
          RRRRIIIIPPPP.    Jazz yanks.   Stan's SCREAM echoes.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY
          
          Mike, wearing basketball gear and bouncing a basketball,
          stands in the middle of the court. Alex enters.
          
                               ALEX
                    I got your text.     What's so
                    important?
          
                              MIKE
                    This year you're making the team.
                    We practice everyday `til try outs.
                    That gives us a week and a half.
          
                                 ALEX
                    Forget it.
          
                              MIKE
                    Yeah, you're right. You probably
                    don't have any skills anyway.
          
          Mike begins to walk out.
          
                                 ALEX
                    Hey!     I got skills.
          
          Mike turns back.
          
                              MIKE
                    So what's your problem?      Is it Stan
                    and his friends?
          
                              ALEX
                    Just leave it alone.
          
                              MIKE
                    You don't need to be afraid of
                    them, Alex.
          
                              ALEX
                    I'm too small anyway.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    That's why we focus on your speed,
                    dribbling and outside shot.
                    Remember, it's not how big you are-
          
                              ALEX
                    -it's how big you play.
                        (QUIZZICALLY)
                    Where did you hear that?
          
                              MIKE
                        (COVERS)
                    I don't know? Read it somewhere I
                    guess. Be a sport. Show me what
                    you got.
          
          Mike tosses Alex the ball. Alex begins to dribble. Mike
          steps up to defend. Alex dribbles quicker, through his legs.
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Alright.   You got a little game.
          
          WHAM. The doors slam open. In walk Stan and his Posse.     A
          BLOOD speckled BAND-AID covers the tip of Stan's nose.
          
                              STAN
                    What are you 2 queers doing in my
                    gym?
          
                              MIKE
                    Let's go, Alex.
          
          Alex stops dribbling. He and Mike move towards the door.
          Stan and his Posse block the way.
          
                              STAN
                    I don't think so. You girls wanna
                    play with the boys then let's play.
                    2 on 2.
          
                              MIKE
                    We'll save you the embarrassment
                    for try-outs.
          
          Stan takes the ball from Alex, turns his back, dribbles.
          
                              STAN
                    Come on, Ally. Embarrass me.
          
          While dribbling, Stan moves backwards, bumping into Alex's
          midsection, forcing Alex back.
          
                                                                   58.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    Back off, Stan.
          
          Alex takes a deep breath, tired of being afraid-
          
                                 ALEX
                    It's okay.     I got him.
          
          Alex throws his hands up, tries to defend the much bigger
          Stan. Stan easily backs Alex down, faking left and right.
          
                                 STAN
                    You ready?     Here it comes.
          
          Stan spins, elbows high...POW...Alex catches one to the head
          and DROPS. Stan shoots and scores.
          
                                 STAN (CONT'D)
                    2 points!     And I was fouled!
          
          Stan high 5's Jazz and Kevin. Blind with RAGE, Mike RUSHES
          Stan...WHAM...tackles him hard to the floor.
          
          Jazz and Kevin throw Mike off Stan, punching and kicking him.
          
          COACH HARVEY, now 58, enters the gym, runs over to the
          fracas, pulls the boys apart.
          
                             COACH HARVEY
                    Hey! That's enough! That's
                    enough!
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/OFFICE - DAY
          
          Mike and a nervous Alex sit outside the principal's office.
          Mike holds an ice pack to his eye.
          
                              ALEX
                    My mom's been in there a while.
                    She's gonna be pissed.
          
                              MIKE
                    Act like you're hurt and she won't
                    be able to stay mad at you.
          
          The door swings open.    An elated Ed blows in.
          
                              ED
                    Way to go, slugger! Get any shots
                    in?
          
          The Secretary's jaw drops.
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
                              SECRETARY
                    Mr. Freedman, your son has a black
                    eye.
          
                                 ED
                    Wuss!
          
          Ed sits between Mike and Alex.
          
                                 ED (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Alex.     How you doin', buddy?
          
                              ALEX
                    I'm okay I guess.
          
                              ED
                    Good. Good.
                        (turns to Mike, nudges
                         HIM)
                    Nice goin'. How do I look?
                    Anything in my teeth? How's my
                    breath?
          
          Ed flashes his pearly whites then blows on Mike. The
          principal's door opens, an angry Scarlet steps out.
          
                                 SCARLET
                    Ed.
          
                              ED
                    Hey, Scarlet. Exciting, isn't it?
                    My first parent/principal
                    conference.
          
          Scarlet looks sternly to Alex-
          
                                 SCARLET
                    Fighting?     What's gotten into you?
          
                              ALEX
                        (rubs his jaw)
                    I can't talk, Mom.     My jaw.
          
                              SCARLET
                        (MELTS)
                    My poor baby. And how about you,
                    Mark?
          
          Scarlet bends down so she's eye to eye with Mike.   She
          removes the ice pack...a purple shiner.
          
                                                                   60.
          
          
          
                               SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    Ouch.   You poor thing. Does it
                    hurt?
          
          Scarlet strokes Mike's face. Mike loses himself in her
          caring, gentle touch.
          
                              MIKE
                    Not anymore. You smell great.
          
          Scarlet, a bit weirded out by Mike, stands.
          
                              SCARLET
                    Alex, I'll meet you at the car.     I
                    need to talk to Uncle Ed for a
                    second.
          
          Alex shuffles out of the office.   Scarlet turns to Ed, hushed-
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    Did you give him the divorce
                    papers?
          
                              ED
                    I sent them to him.
          
                              SCARLET
                    Is it another woman? I can handle
                    it. Tell me the truth.
          
                              ED
                    I haven't heard from him, really.
          
          Scarlet looks down, fights back tears, unravels a bit...
          
                              SCARLET
                    Okay. If you do, please have him
                    call home. For the kids...I'm
                    running out of excuses-
          
                              ED
                    I'll tell him.    I promise.
          
          Scarlet forces a smile. Mike watches her go. For the first
          time he's seen HER REALITY...hurt, pain, frustration. Mike
          places his head sadly in his hands.
          
          Julie the Principal pokes her head out the door.
          
                              JULIE
                    Ed, come on in.
          
          Ed whispers to Mike.
          
                                                                   61.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    I'll take it from here.
          
          As Ed passes Julie on the way in-
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    I'm heartbroken. The boy's
                    incorrigible.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Ed takes a seat across from Julie, puts on his best `troubled
          parent' look.
          
                              JULIE
                    Look, if it was only one isolated
                    fight it wouldn't distress me all
                    that much. Boys will be boys.
                    But, it's also been brought to my
                    attention that Mark may have Krazy
                    glued a boy to his chair.
          
          Ed stifles a laugh, puts on a serious face.
          
                                 ED
                    My son?     Mark!   Get in here!   Now!
          
          Mike slouches in, takes a seat.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    Did you glue a boy to his chair?
          
                                 MIKE
                    No.
          
          Ed throws his hands up in exasperation.
          
                              ED
                    See? The boy's out of control.
                    He's acting up at home. He won't
                    eat his vegetables-
          
                      MIKE                                 ED
          He shaves his back.                He sucks his thumb.
          
                       MIKE                                ED
          He wears girls underwear.          He wets his bed.
          
                                                                   62.
          
          
          
                              JULIE
                    Enough! Mark, I know it's hard to
                    be the new kid but if I have
                    anymore trouble from you, you'll be
                    facing detentions or worse. You
                    can go now.
          
          Mike nods, exits.   Ed stands and with exaggerated sadness-
          
                              ED
                    He's crying out for help and I
                    don't know what to do. It hurts so
                    bad. Maybe we could discuss this
                    over margaritas?
          
                              JULIE
                    Let's give him time to figure it
                    out on his own. If the situation
                    gets worse then we'll take the next
                    step.
          
                              ED
                    You're the expert. I'm just a
                    single dad out here blowing like
                    dust in the wind.
          
          Ed shakes Julie's hand and exits, sniffling.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
          
          A dirt covered Scarlet wrestles a roll of sod down.
          
                              MIKE (o.s.)
                    Got an extra pair of gloves?
          
          Scarlet peers over her shoulder...Mike wanders in.    Scarlet
          stands, wipes her bare, dirty hands on her jeans.
          
                              SCARLET
                    Gloves are for sissies.
          
                              MIKE
                    Yeah, but I just had a manicure.
          
                              SCARLET
                        (LAUGHS)
                    You're serious? You want to help?
          
                              MIKE
                    Are you kidding? I love
                    landscaping!
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  63.
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    It's right up there with watching
                    "Sex and the City" and snuggling.
          
          Scarlet laughs, eyes him skeptically-
          
                              SCARLET
                    Mark, I'm 36 years old-
          
                              MIKE
                    I'm just doing this to make a few
                    bucks so I can buy Laker tickets.
          
                              SCARLET
                        (BLUSHES)
                    Embarrassing. Sorry.      I'll give
                    you 10 dollars a day.
          
                              MIKE
                    Wow. 10 whole dollars. At that
                    rate I should be able to buy
                    tickets in...2011.
          
                                  SCARLET
                    Fine.   20.     Grab a roll.
          
          Mike and Scarlet, step over to the sod, lift a roll together,
          carry it over to the spot.
          
                              MIKE
                    What are the benefits like here?
          
                              SCARLET
                    I'll throw in a baloney sandwich.
          
                                  MIKE
                    Deal.
          
          Mike and Scarlet share a laugh.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/LIBRARY - DAY
          
          Mike strolls in, sits at a back table, pulls a college
          application from his knapsack. He takes out a pen, places
          the tip to the paper where it says `name' when-
          
          WE hear the muffled sound of CRYING. Mike rises, follows the
          sobs through the maze of stacks until he finds-
          
                                  MIKE
                    Maggie?
          
          -seated on the floor, head hidden between her knees.   Maggie
          looks up, sees Mike, quickly dries her eyes.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          
                              MAGGIE
                    What do you want? To rub it in my
                    face? Say I told you so?
          
                              MIKE
                    You lost me?
          
          Maggie drops her head back between her knees.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Stan dumped me.
          
          Maggie BAWLS loudly.    Mike panics, fearing the worst-
          
                              MIKE
                    What happened? What did he do?
                    You didn't...
          
                              MAGGIE
                    My mom was working last night.
                    Stan came over with a box of-
          
          Mike slaps his palms over his ears.
          
                              MIKE
                    Your next word better be `cookies'
                    or you're in big, big trouble!
          
                              MAGGIE
                    What am I going to do?    I can't
                    live without him.
          
          Maggie takes Mike's shirt, BLOWS her nose on it.
          
                              MIKE
                    Maggie, did you two...you
                    know...do...
          
                                 MAGGIE
                    Do what?
          
                              MIKE
                    That thing...that rabbits do a lot
                    of and that a girl your age should
                    never do and should only do when
                    she's married.
          
                               MAGGIE
                    Sex?   No, that's why he dumped me!
          
          Maggie bawls again. Mike silently celebrates, sits beside
          her, awkwardly pats her on the back.
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    There, there now.       It's okay.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Sure he was a jerk but he was there
                    for me. Which is more than I can
                    say for any other man in my life.
          
          Maggie sobs uncontrollably.      Mike takes a deep breath, calms-
          
                              MIKE
                    When you're young everything seems
                    like the end of the world. But
                    it's not. It's just the beginning.
                    And you might have to meet a few
                    more jerks, but one day you'll meet
                    a boy who treats you the way you
                    deserve to be treated...like the
                    sun rises and sets with you.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    You really think so?
          
                                 MIKE
                    I know so.
          
          Maggie throws her arms around Mike, hugs him tight. Mike
          hugs her back. A moment he's never had with his daughter.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    You're so sweet.
          
          ANGLE ON Maggie's face.       She's SMITTEN.
          
          MONTAGE OF LIFE
          
          
          EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
          
          Alex dribbles, using both hands, while running through a maze
          of cones. Whenever he messes up, Mike makes him start again.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
          
          Mike and Scarlet settle the limestone rocks into the freshly
          laid sod creating a walkway.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY
          
          Maggie solves a difficult problem on the board, much to Mr.
          Adam's chagrin.
          
                                                                   66.
          
          
          Maggie turns from the chalkboard and smiles flirtatiously at
          Mike. Stan catches this exchange and pops the back of Mike's
          head.
          
          
          EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT
          
          Lights shine down. Alex stands behind the 3 point line.
          Mike feeds him balls. Alex shoots and moves. Shoots and
          moves. More misses than hits.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Again, Mike and Ed sit before a stern Julie.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - DAY
          
          Mike teaches Alex the cross over dribble. Scarlet brings the
          boys water. Mike checks her out as she goes back in the
          house. Alex bounces the ball off his head.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY
          
          A muffled buzz. Mike reaches into his pocket, pulls out his
          phone. A PIX MESSAGE. Mike opens it. A close up of perfect
          CLEAVAGE.
          
          Mike peeks over his shoulder...the Wonder Bras text on their
          phones. He's confused until-
          
          -Mike turns a little more in his seat...MAGGIE smiles
          seductively at him, blows a kiss. Mike GASPS, spins back
          around...TRAUMATIZED.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
          
          Scarlet fills holes with plants then waters them with a hose.
          She turns, finds Mike SLEEPING in the grass. Scarlet picks
          up the hose, TURNS IT ON HIM. Mike leaps up, chases her.
          
          
          EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Mike, Alex, Nicole, Maggie, the Bras and a slew of KIDS hang
          by Mike's Aston. Stan, Jazz and Kevin are all that's left by
          Stan's Mustang.
          
                                                                   67.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
          
          Alex scampers through the maze of cones, dribbling from hand
          to hand...and does it perfectly. Mike and Alex high 5.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
          
          Mike and Scarlet lug an ornate, wooden bench to it's spot.
          They sit. Mike casually places a hand on Scarlet's leg.
          Scarlet casually removes it.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY
          
          A game of 1 on 1. Alex dribbles up to Mike. Mike crouches
          in a defensive stance. Mike goes for the ball. Alex crosses
          over. Mike misses. Alex pulls up, shoots and scores. Mike
          smiles, shakes his head.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Again, Mike and Ed sit before Julie. She hands Ed a slip of
          paper...3 detentions. Ed chokes back crocodile tears.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY
          
          Mike places books in his locker, shuts the door revealing...a
          goo goo eyed Maggie. Mike startles and RUNS. Maggie chases.
          
          
          INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
          
          Alex stands behind the 3 point line. Mike rapidly feeds him
          balls. Alex catches, shoots and moves. This time...they're
          all going in. Mike passes the last ball. Alex shoots and we-
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON a ball going through the hoop. Wider reveals Alex
          following through. He and Mike tap fists.
          
          It's TRY-OUTS. Coach Harvey, a number of HOPEFULS, Maggie,
          Nicole and the Bras watch the game of half court, 2 on 2.
          Stan and Jazz vs. Mike and Alex.
          
                                                                    68.
          
          
          
          Mike and Alex school Stan and Jazz. Steals, picks, fancy
          passes and scoring. The Coach watches with awe. A final 3
          pointer by Mike in Stan's face seals the deal.
          
                               COACH HARVEY
                    That makes 11-3. Game over.
                    Gather up.
          
          As Alex passes Harvey, Harvey stops him-
          
                              COACH HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    You've gotta little bit of your old
                    man in you, O'Donnell.
          
          The Team and the Hopefuls huddle around Coach Harvey.
          
                              COACH HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    As you all know due to the amount
                    of seniors coming back I only have
                    2 open spots on the roster. It's
                    Freedman and O'Donnell. The rest
                    of you hit the showers.
          
          The Hopefuls trudge out of the gym.    Alex leaps into the air.
          
                               ALEX
                    Wooo!   We did it, Mark!    We did it!
          
                              MIKE
                    You killed it out there!
          
          Alex runs over, hugs Nicole. Mike beams with pride.     Coach
          Harvey puts an arm around him-
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Son, I don't know where you came
                    from but you just made my year.
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Alex rushes through the door.   Mike and Maggie follow.
          Maggie slaps Mike's butt.
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
                                   ALEX
                    Mom!    Mom!
          
                              SCARLET (o.s.)
                    I'll be right out, Honey!
          
                                                                 69.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    I got'a use the bathroom.
          
          WE follow Mike down the hall. As he passes a half open door,
          he pauses, peeks in...Scarlet, facing away, pulls a shirt
          over her nude back, shakes out her long hair.
          
          Mike watches...no, he GAZES longingly, lovingly...lost in her
          beauty until...Scarlet turns, startles-
          
                             SCARLET
                    Mark? I didn't know you were
                    there.
          
                                 MIKE
                    I'm sorry.     You just look so
                    beautiful.
          
          Scarlet blushes...it's been a while since she's heard that.
          
                                 SCARLET
                    Thank you.
          
                              MIKE
                    Can I zip you up?
          
                              SCARLET
                    I'm wearing a sweater.
          
                              MIKE
                    Your jeans?
          
          Scarlet walks towards him and...SLAM...shuts the door on him.
          Mike wanders to the bathroom, shaking his head-
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Stupid, idiot, stupid.
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mike enters, steps over to the toilet. Maggie slips in behind
          him, shuts the door. He whirls around.
          
                              MIKE
                    Maggie, what...
          
          Maggie places a finger on his lips.
          
                                                              70.
          
          
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Shhh. I get it now. Why you didn't
                    want me to be with Stan, the nice
                    things you said in the library.
                    It's because you wanted me.
          
          Maggie backs Mike against the wall.
          
                              MIKE
                    Maggie, listen to me.    I'm not the
                    person you think...
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Shhh. Yes, you are. You're a good
                    guy. You're not like the others.
          
                              MIKE
                    That's right! I'm not like the
                    others. I'm very different than
                    the others. So different that you
                    and I can never be...
          
          Maggie stops, looks quizzically at Mike-
          
                              MAGGIE
                    What are you trying to say?    Are
                    you..."confused"?
          
                              MIKE
                    Yes! Yes! That's it. I'm
                    confused. Extremely confused.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Ohmygod! It all makes sense now!
                    Your hair. The highlights.
          
          Mike starts to speak.   Stops.   Finally gets it-
          
                              MIKE
                    What? No-no-no-no. I'm not gay.
                    I'm...I've been in love with the
                    same girl since I was 17.
          
          Maggie switches back into predatory mode.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Who is it? Does she go to our
                    school? Do I know her?
          
                              MIKE
                    No, you don't. Now-
                        (eyes the toilet)
                    -if you don't mind?
          
                                                                       71.
          
          
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Tell your girlfriend she better
                    keep a close eye on you.
          
          Maggie smiles seductively and struts out.
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Alex types on his phone.   Mike enters.
          
                              MIKE
                    Who you texting?
          
                               ALEX
                    My dad.   I have to tell him about
                    today.
          
          Mike nods...then realizes...BEEP...BEEP. HIS PHONE.     Alex
          and Maggie look to Mike. Mike checks his phone.
          
                              ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Did you just get a text?
          
                              MIKE
                        (NERVOUS)
                    Me? No. Yes. It's Ed. I mean
                    dad. Not your dad. My dad. I'll
                    just call him back.
          
          Scarlet enters. She looks AMAZING.

                    So?   What happened? Tell me.     Tell
                    me.   I'm dying to hear.
          
                              ALEX
                    I did it. I'm a Falcon!     The first
                    game's in 2 weeks.
          
                              SCARLET
                    Oh my God, Alex! That's so
                    incredible!
          
          Scarlet wraps Alex in a big hug.    Mike watches.   It's a
          bittersweet moment for him.
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    I'm so happy for you. And now I
                    want to show you guys something.
          
          Scarlet, unable to contain her excitement, leads Mike and
          Alex to the french doors and flicks a light switch...
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
                                SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    Ta da!
          
          Thousands of tiny, white lights illuminate Scarlet's OASIS...
          
                              MIKE
                    You hung the lights!
          
                              SCARLET
                    I wanted you to be the first to see
                    it.
          
                              ALEX
                    Mom, it's sick.
          
          
          EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          The 3 step outside.   Mike, truly blown away, takes picture
          with his iPhone.
          
                              MIKE
                    It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm
                    sorry I never saw how talented you
                    are...I mean when people see this
                    and how talented you are you'll be
                    designing sanctuaries all over the
                    city.
          
                               SCARLET
                        (BEAMS)
                    Thank you.
          
                              ALEX
                    Mom, why are you all dressed up?
          
                              SCARLET
                    Oh my God. I almost forgot.    I
                    have a date.
          
          Off Mike's stunned reaction.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Mike marches in behind Scarlet.   As they reach the door, he
          steps in front of her.
          
                              MIKE
                    Let's see who the lucky guy is.
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
          
          Mike swings the door open revealing...Dom Johnson.
          
                                  MIKE (CONT'D)
                     I knew it!
          
          SLAM.   Mike shuts the door, blocks it.
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                     I knew you had a thing for him!
                     You can't do this! You took vows.
                     What kind of example are you
                     setting for the kids!?
          
                               SCARLET
                     Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am.
                     But I'm too old for you.
          
          Scarlet moves Mike aside, opens the door.     Dom stands in the
          doorway holding a bouquet.
          
                                DOM
                     Wow. You look absolutely
                     ravishing.
          
                               MIKE
                     Keep it in your pants, Casanova.
          
                               SCARLET
                     Don't mind him. You all set?
          
                               DOM
                     Let's do it.
          
          Scarlet heads for the van.     Dom looks to Mike-
          
                               DOM (CONT'D)
                     Hey, kid...if the vans'a
                     rockin'...well you know the rest.
          
          Dom imitates humping, jogs after Scarlet.
          
                               MIKE
                     Don't you lay a finger on her,
                     Johnson! I know where you live!
          
          Mike slams the door.
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          A contemplative Alex scoops lasagna onto plates.    An agitated
          Mike enters, pulls up a seat at the counter.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          
                              ALEX
                    It's weird to think about my mom
                    with someone other than my dad.
          
                              MIKE
                    It's adultery! If this were
                    Afghanistan she'd be dragged
                    through the village by goats.   You
                    need to talk to her.
          
                              ALEX
                    My mom's been pretty sad the past
                    few months. She deserves to be
                    happy. My dad obviously
                    is...wherever he is.
          
                              MIKE
                    Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he
                    could be here right now with you
                    but there's a real good reason he
                    can't be.
          
                              ALEX
                    No, my dad's not a family guy. This
                    is dumb but I used to tell him I
                    was on the basketball team because
                    I knew he'd never make it to a
                    game.
          
                              MIKE
                    Then why would you tell him that?
          
                              ALEX
                    I guess I was hoping it would make
                    him like me more.
          
          Mike is CRUSHED.
          
          
          INT. GUCCI STORE - DAY
          
          Mike paces in front of a dressing room.   A SALESMAN waits by
          the door.
          
                              MIKE
                    My wife's moving on. My son
                    doesn't think I like him and my
                    daughter's in love with me. I need
                    to change back, Ed.
          
          Ed steps from the changing room wearing very tight, ultra hip
          clothes that belong on a 20 year old...he looks ridiculous.
          
                                                                 75.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    What about college?
          
                                MIKE
                    I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep
                    til I die. I just want my family
                    back.
                         (BEAT)
                    You're not gonna wear that, are
                    you?
          
          Ed checks his butt in a full length mirror, nods happily.
          
                              ED
                    Baby's got back.
          
          Ed retreats into the changing room.
          
                              ED (CONT'D) (o.s.)
                    Now that Julie's agreed to go out
                    with me tonight, I need you to
                    start behaving. I can't have her
                    thinking my son is a complete
                    degenerate.
          
                              MIKE
                    Fine. I want to have some kids
                    over tonight to celebrate Alex
                    making the team. Is that cool?
          
          Ed, wearing only his banana hammock underwear and socks,
          steps from the room, hands the clothes to the Salesman.
          
                              ED
                    Wrap it up. No, it's not cool. I
                    remember hearing what those parties
                    were like, kids peeing everywhere,
                    food on the ceilings, puke in the
                    pool.
          
                              MIKE
                    Listen to you. You sound like an
                    old man.
          
          Other SHOPPERS eye Ed oddly as they pass.
          
                              ED
                    No party. I mean it.    Don't make
                    me take the car away.
          
                              MIKE
                    Don't treat me like a child, Ed.
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    I won't when you stop acting like
                    one.
          
          Mike grabs Ed's bare tits and TWISTS. Ed screams, grabs
          Mike's tits and TWISTS. Both of them HOWL in pain.
          
                               SALESMAN
                    Sir!   Please!
          
          Mike and Ed, both still titty twisting, look up. Everyone in
          the store stares. They each let go, force smiles.
          
                              ED
                    This isn't over...son!
          
                              MIKE
                    Not even close...Dad!
          
          Ed stomps into the dressing room rubbing his sore boobs.
          Mike pulls out his iPhone, begins texting.
          
                                                              CUT TO:

                    the word out.
          
          The Bras type away, simultaneously hit SEND. WIDE
          REVEALS...hundreds of students...the beeps of hundreds of
          cell phones.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          CARS line the street. A steady flow of KIDS stream towards
          the front door. MUSIC pounds from within. It's a RAGER.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          MAYHEM. Kids raid the refrigerator, throw food around.
          Another KID sprays the room with the removable sink head.
          
          Mike rushes in, grabs the sink head from the Kid.
          
                                                                   77.

                                 WONDER BRAS (O.S.)
                    Hey, Sexy.
          
          Mike turns without thinking SPRAYING all 3 Wonder Bras in the
          face. The Bras scream. Mike replaces the nozzle.
          
                              MIKE
                    I'm so sorry. Have you seen Alex?
          
          The Bras wipe themselves off, grab Mike's hands.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    Dance with us!
          
          The Bras drag a reluctant Mike out of the kitchen and into -
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          PARTY-GOERS dance everywhere and on top of everything.
          
          The Bras surround Mike, each girl grinding on him as if it
          were a competition.
          
          Lauren takes Mike by the face, turns him towards her-
          
                              LAUREN
                    Nambib-bib-ib, that African country
                    makes me horny.
          
          Jamie spins Mike towards her, places his hands on her boobs-
          
                              JAMIE
                    Perfect, aren't they?
          
          Samantha pulls Mike roughly by the hair, twists him around-
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    Which one of us is it gonna be?
          
          Mike tries to squeeze out. The Bras block him. The music
          changes...a remix version of Hammer's `Can't Touch This'
          blares.
          
                              MIKE
                    I thought you girls wanted to
                    dance?
          
          Mike breaks into the 80's Hammer routine WE saw from the
          first scene.
          
                                                                      78.
          
          
          
          The Bras back up. Party-Goers stop what they're doing and
          watch...not sure whether to laugh or join in.
          
          And then, the Bras fall in.      Followed by others.   The party
          just got hotter.
          
          Maggie runs through the party and out the back. Stan chases
          after her. Mike inconspicuously Hammer walks his way out of
          the mix and outside.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - NIGHT
          
          Stan corners Maggie against the back wall.
          
                              STAN
                    I was upset. I'm sorry. But I
                    need you to show me you love me.
                    Then we'll move in together.
          
                                MAGGIE
                    Whatever.    I'm with someone else
                    now.
          
                              STAN
                    Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid
                    enough?
          
                                MAGGIE
                    Him.
          
          Stan turns angrily toward Mike as he approaches.
          
                              MIKE
                    Party's over, Stan.      You're out of
                    here.
          
                              STAN
                    Who's gonna make me leave?      You?
          
                              MIKE
                    I would but it smells like you've
                    been drinking so I'll let the cops
                    do it.
          
          Mike pulls out his phone.      Stan looks to Maggie then back to
          Mike, laughs-
          
                              STAN
                    You can have the nun.      She doesn't
                    put out anyway.
          
                                                                 79.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    On second thought-
          
          Mike SWINGS. Stan ducks, throws a giant uppercut. POW.
          Mike's eyes roll back in his head and WE cut to BLACK.
          
          
          INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT/DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          The HOSTESS shows Ed and Julie to their table by the window.
          Ed wears his new Gucci outfit. Julie's under dressed.
          
                              HOSTESS
                    There you are, Mr. Freedman.
          
                             ED
                    Thanks. Put this towards your
                    studies.
          
          Ed hands the Hostess a 50.   Julie rolls her eyes.
          
                              JULIE
                    When you asked me to get together
                    to talk about Mark this isn't what
                    I envisioned. This isn't a date,
                    Ed.
          
                              ED
                    Are you insinuating that I'd use my
                    son's misfortune just to go out
                    with you? What kind of a father do
                    you think I am?
          
                              JULIE
                    As long as we're on the same page.
          
          A WAITER approaches.
          
                              WAITER
                    Good evening. Would you care to
                    see the wine-
          
                              ED
                    Bring us the 1962 Petrus.
          
          The Waiter nods, leaves.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    You're going to love this wine.
                    $2000 dollars a bottle.
          
                                                           80.
          
          
          
                              JULIE
                    I don't drink. So tell me what you
                    think's going on with Mark?
          
                              ED
                    It's baffling really but I noticed
                    he's been drinking a lot of diet
                    ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay?
          
                              JULIE
                    You didn't ask me here to talk
                    about Mark, did you?
          
                              ED
                    Do you like caviar? Because if you
                    do you have to try the Almas. 100
                    year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce.
          
          Julie throws her napkin on the table.
          
                              JULIE
                    You're disgusting, Ed.
          
                              ED
                    What? You don't like Beluga?     You
                    can get something else.
          
                              JULIE
                    I'm not some 22 year-old who you
                    can impress with caviar and
                    expensive wine.
          
                              ED
                    Would the caviar and expensive wine
                    impress you if you were on a yacht
                    off Monte Carlo?
          
                              JULIE
                    I came here because I'm concerned
                    about the wellbeing of your son but
                    you don't care about Mark. All
                    you're concerned with is proving to
                    me how wealthy you are.
          
                              ED
                    I do care about Mike...Mark.
                    Whatever his name is.
          
                              JULIE
                    You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm
                    sure when you were the guy the boys
                    picked on and the girls ignored you
                    were really sweet.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 81.
                              JULIE (CONT'D)
                    But you thought becoming rich would
                    solve all your problems. Instead it
                    made you just like them. I have to
                    go.
          
          Julie rises.   Ed takes her wrist.
          
                              ED
                    Wait. You're right. I'm acting
                    like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please
                    stay.
          
          Julie begrudgingly sits back down.
          
                              JULIE
                    Act normal or I'm leaving.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON Mike's face, eyes shut. A hand gently strokes his
          head. Mike stirs awake, smiles, eyes still closed-
          
                              MIKE
                    I had the craziest dream. I was 17
                    again and back in high school. It
                    was horrible, Scarlet-
          
                                MAGGIE (o.s.)
                    Scarlet!?
          
          Mike's eyes pop open. WIDER reveals Mike and Maggie on the
          bed. Mike's head rests on Maggie's lap.
          
          Mike JUMPS off the bed, scrambles to the other side of the
          room and behind a chair. Maggie leaps off the bed.
          
                              MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    You wanna play? Okay, let's play.
                    I'm the hungry lioness and you're a
                    baby gazelle.
          
          Maggie ROARS, chases Mike around the room.
          
                              MIKE
                    Wait! This is highly inappropriate
                    and dysfunctional. Listen to me,
                    Maggie. I'm your father.
          
          Maggie growls, stalks Mike around the bed.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    And I've been a bad, bad girl,
                    Daddy.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
          Maggie dives across the bed.    Mike dodges, runs out the door.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Alex and Nicole sit closely by a fire pit, laughing.
          
                              ALEX
                    How about Mrs. Cruz? Every time
                    she rolls her r's she spits all
                    over me.
          
          Alex imitates Mrs. Cruz. Nicole laughs, places her hand on
          Alex's leg. Alex looks down at her hand, then up at her,
          both staring at one another...THE MOMENT.
          
          Nicole closes her eyes, moves in. Alex moves in then
          FREAKS. He bounds out of his chair, sprints inside leaving
          Nicole hanging.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          A distraught Alex pushes his way through the insanity.   He
          finds Mike running down the stairs.
          
                              ALEX
                    Mike, I blew it!     I totally blew
                    it!
          
                                 MIKE
                    Blew what?     What happened?
          
                              ALEX
                    She wanted me to kiss her but I
                    panicked. I didn't know if I
                    should close my eyes or which way
                    to turn my head or how much tongue
                    I'm supposed to use-
          
                              MIKE
                    Slow down. Have you ever kissed a
                    girl before?
          
                              ALEX
                    Not a real one. I used to practice
                    on my dad's Playboys.
          
                              MIKE
                    How did you find...forget it. It's
                    easy. All you have to do is take
                    her face in your hands gently like
                    THIS-
          
                                                                      83.
          
          
          
          Mike places a hand gently on either side of Alex's face.
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                     -hold her still as you adjust your
                     head, close your eyes and kiss her.
                     The rest happens naturally.
          
          A BOY walks past, sees Mike romantically holding Alex's face.
          
                               BOY
                     That is so wrong.
          
          Mike and Alex quickly separate.
          
                               ALEX
                     What if I, you know, pitch a tent?
          
                                MIKE
                     If you feel it, you know, getting
                     angry, take a step back. Now go get
                     that kiss.
          
          Alex takes a deep breath, steps outside.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          A determined Alex marches over to the seated Nicole.
          
                                ALEX
                     Nicole.
          
          Nicole stands-
          
                               NICOLE
                     I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to-
          
          Before she can finish Alex's hands are on her face and his
          lips on hers. It's as if time stands still.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Mike watches his son's MAGICAL FIRST KISS.     And when Alex

          BEEP.   BEEP.   Mike pulls out his phone.   Text message.

          Mike rushes to the stairs. An angry Maggie storms down them.
          Mike ducks. Maggie passes. Mike races up.

          Samantha, Jamie and Lauren in the bed, clothes on the floor.

                    We decided not to make you choose.

                    You can have all 3 of us.
          
          The chance of a lifetime.    A legend making moment.

                        (looks sadly at the Bras)
                    Girls, if I was 20 years younger
                    I'd...probably only last 10 seconds
                    anyway. Put your clothes back on.
          
          Mike turns, exits. On the way out WE actually hear SNIFFLING.

                              ED
                    God's honest truth. I had the
                    whole costume. I used to go
                    everywhere dressed like a wizard.
                    No wonder I didn't get a date all
                    through high school. Annnnd you
                    think I'm the biggest nerd ever.
          
                              JULIE
                    No, no, really. I don't.
                        (catches her breath,
                         suddenly serious)
                    Hark! Who goes there?
          
                              ED

          Free to be herself, Julie lets her hair down, shakes it out.

          They stare at each other incredibly turned on. Ed screams-

          Wider...Mike beside him while Kids cheer the Heavy Kid on.
          
                                MIKE
                      I'm so dead.
          
          Mike turns, finds SCARLET making her way through the crowd.
          
                                MIKE (CONT'D)
                      Oh no!
          
          Mike rushes over to her.
          
                                MIKE (CONT'D)
                      Scarlet, what are you doing here?
          
                                SCARLET
                      I'm looking for Alex. It's past
                      his curfew and he wasn't picking up
                      his phone. Is he here?
          
                                MIKE
                      Yeah, he's fine.   He's with his
                      girlfriend.
          
                                SCARLET
                      Alex has a girlfriend?
          
                                                                    86.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    He does and she's really cute.
                    Come on.
          
          Mike leads Scarlet away from the pool.
          
          
          INT. FERRARI - NIGHT
          
          Ed and Julie drive through the upscale neighborhood.
          
                              JULIE
                    How did you get your hands on the
                    5th edition? That's not due out for
                    another three years.
          
                              ED
                    I have two words for you.    Russian
                    mafia.
          
                              JULIE
                    Drive faster.
          
          He steps on the gas. He fishtails around a corner. Cars pack
          Ed's street and driveway. Boys and girls trample the front
          lawn. One BOY urinates in a flower bed.
          
                              JULIE (CONT'D)
                    Calm thyself, Marius.
          
                              ED
                    That little-!   I'll kill him!
          
          Ed double parks the car, jumps out.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Ed storms up the driveway.    Julie hurries after him.   A KID
          spies Julie, calls out-
          
                              KID
                    It's Ms. Goodwin!    Run!
          
          All the Kids on the lawn SCATTER in different directions.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Ed and Julie enter the crowded, loud room. Kids dance, stomp
          around on the furniture. A furious Ed screams-
          
                                                                    87.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    Everybody out!   Get out!   Get out!
          
          Nobody flinches.   Julie WHISTLES loudly.   The Kids stop.
          
                              JULIE
                    This party is over! If you don't
                    want to spend the next 3 months in
                    detention you will leave...now!
          
          The Kids BEELINE for the door.    Ed stops a GIRL.
          
                              ED
                    Do you know where Mark Freedman is?
          
                              GIRL
                    I think I saw him go outside.
          
          SPLAT. A slice of pizza falls from the ceiling onto Ed's
          head. The Girl laughs, exits.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Maggie enters, weeds through the crowd, bumps into the Bras.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Have you seen Mark?
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    We're looking for him too.
          
          Maggie scowls, heads for the back door.     The Bras chase.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Mike and Scarlet hide behind the pool house, peek around the
          corner, spy on Alex and Nicole by the fire pit. Alex is
          animated, confident...
          
                              SCARLET
                    He's like a totally different
                    person.
          
          Scarlet and Mike step back by the pool, sit on a lounge.
          
                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
                    It's been so good for him to have
                    you around. You have no idea.
          
                                                                 88.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    Believe me, I do. He's a great
                    kid. And you're an amazing mother.
          
                              SCARLET
                    I'm not so sure. I mean look at
                    me. I showed up at a party to drag
                    my son home. Could I be any more
                    embarrassing? And how many amazing
                    mothers run their kids' father off?
          
                              MIKE
                    Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't
                    blame yourself for his stupidity.
          
                              SCARLET
                    I knew he was unhappy. I knew he
                    hated his job. I should've been
                    more supportive, more sympathetic
                    to what he was going through. He
                    gave up a lot for me.
          
                              MIKE
                    That's bull shit! You, Maggie and
                    Alex are the best thing that ever
                    happened to me...him. He was just
                    too selfish to recognize it. At
                    least, that's how I see it.
          
          Scarlet smiles thankfully at Mike.
          
          ANGLE...Maggie and the Bras roam the backyard searching for
          Mike.
          
                              JAMIE
                    He's over there.    By the pool.
          
                              SAMANTHA
                    Who's the ho?
          
                               MAGGIE
                    Mom?
          
          ANGLE...Alex and Nicole, hand in hand, stroll back towards
          the house when Alex freezes-
          
                               ALEX
                    Whoa.   What's my mom doing here?
          
          ANGLE...Scarlet places a hand over Mike's.
          
                                                                      89.
          
          
          
                                SCARLET
                      You're sweet. I have no idea why
                      I'm telling you all this. There's
                      just something so familiar...
          
          Scarlet looks into Mike's eyes. Mike stares back. She's
          vulnerable. He loves her. It's perfect. Mike leans in and
          KISSES HER...PASSIONATELY.
          
          SSSSSLAP.   Mike falls off the chair.   Scarlet leaps up.
          
                                SCARLET (CONT'D)
                      What do you think you're doing!?
          
          Mike scrambles to his feet.
          
                                MIKE
                      Scar, just calm down. I have
                      something to tell you but I need
                      you to keep an open mind. Can you
                      do that for me?
          
                                SCARLET
                      This conversation is over, Mark.
          
                                MIKE
                      I'm not Mark.
          
                                SCARLET
                      I'm not in the mood for games.
          
                                MIKE
                      It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike.
                      It's me...your husband.
          
          Scarlet winces as if dealt a blow-
          
                                 SCARLET
                      What?   Why would you say that?
          
                                MIKE
                      It's the truth. I'm the father of
                      your children. You have to believe
                      me.
          
                                SCARLET
                      Don't ever come near me or my
                      family again. If you do, I'll have
                      you arrested or better yet,
                      institutionalized.
          
          Scarlet marches towards the house.    Mike on her heels
          pleading.
          
                                                                   90.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    Let me explain, Scar.
          
          As she passes Ed and Julie.
          
                              SCARLET
                    Your son needs a shrink!
          
          Scarlet storms off.   Before Mike can protest-
          
                                MAGGIE
                    Pervert!
          
          Mike turns. SLAP. Maggie lights him up, runs for the house.
          SLAP, SLAP, SLAP. The Bras add theirs on the way out.
          
          Alex and Nicole march past.    Mike reaches for Alex's arm.
          Alex pulls it away.
          
                              MIKE
                    Alex, wait. Let me explain-
          
                              ALEX
                    How could you do this to me?
          
          Alex whisks Nicole into the house.   Mike lowers his head.    Ed
          stomps over, grabs Mike.
          
                              ED
                    This place is a disaster! A kid
                    pissed all over my English garden!
                    What were you thinking!?
          
                              MIKE
                    She hates me, Ed.    I've ruined
                    everything.
          
          Mike runs for the house.   Julie looks quizzically to Ed.
          
                              JULIE
                    Who hates him? What's going on?
          
          Ed shifts uncomfortably, takes a deep breath.
          
                              ED
                    Oh boy. I don't quite know how to
                    put this.
          
                              JULIE
                    Try being honest.
          
                                                                      91.
          
          
          
                               ED
                     He's not really my son.    I don't
                     have a son.
          
          SLAP.   Ed looks like he's about to cry.
          
                               JULIE
                     Mark's obviously having a crisis
                     and you...you insensitive bastard,
                     you disown him? He'd be better off
                     with his mother in Thailand.
          
          Julie strides for the house.     Ed yells after her-
          
                               ED
                     Should I call you?!
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          All is normal.   No signs of a party.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Ed knocks and knocks on Mike's bedroom door.
          
                                ED
                     Come on.   It's been 2 days.    Open
                     up.
          
          WE hear a dragging sound then...CLICK.     Ed turns the knob,
          opens the door, enters.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Dark.   Mike climbs back into bed.   Ed waves at the air.
          
                               ED
                     Jesus. It smells like Jeffrey
                     Dahmer's kitchen in here.
          
          Ed pulls up the blinds, opens the windows. A disheveled,
          Mike groans, rolls away from the light. Ed sits on the bed.
          
                               ED (CONT'D)
                     Are you alright?
          
                               MIKE
                     I really messed up.    I've lost my
                     family.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          
                              ED
                    That's not true.      Nothing's ever
                    truly lost.
          
                              MIKE
                    What about you and Julie?
          
                                ED
                    Oh, that?    That's lost.
          
                              MIKE
                    Sorry about the party.      I'll pay
                    for any damages.
          
                              ED
                    Don't worry about it. My spa guy
                    got the last of the vomit out of
                    the pool so we're good. I don't
                    mean to rub salt in your wounds but-
          
          Ed holds up the manila envelope of divorce papers.
          
                              ED (CONT'D)
                    -you're due in court in an hour.
          
          A look of determination comes over Mike's face.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          The BMW roars out of the garage, Ed driving, tears down the
          driveway, fishtailing onto the street, LOSES CONTROL, rips
          across a neighbor's lawn then back onto the road and off.
          
          
          INT. LOS ANGELES COURT HOUSE/COURTROOM - DAY
          
          Crowded pews. Scarlet stands before the JUDGE, her right
          hand raised as she's sworn in.
          
                              BAILIFF
                    -the whole truth and nothing but
                    the truth so help you God?
          
                                SCARLET
                    I do.
          
          Scarlet sits beside her ATTORNEY.     The Judge eyes her papers.
          
                                                                  93.
          
          
          
                              JUDGE
                    You've requested a divorce by the
                    State of California citing
                    irreconcilable differences. Is
                    this correct?
          
                              SCARLET
                    Yes, your Honor.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Is Michael O'Donnell or his
                    representative present?
          
                              SCARLET
                        (SADLY)
                    No, your Honor.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Then I take his absence as
                    agreement to the orders of the
                    divorce. Let's proceed. You're
                    not asking for alimony or child
                    support?
          
                              JULIE
                    No, your honor.
          
          
          EXT. LOS ANGELES COURT HOUSE - DAY
          
          Ed's BMW skids to a stop in front of the building.   Mike and
          Ed bound out, race up the court steps-
          
                              ED
                    What exactly are we doing?
          
                              MIKE
                    I don't know. We just need to stop
                    her from going through with it!
          
                              ED
                    A well thought out plan.   Good job.

                    The mother will have full custody
                    of the children. The father will
                    have visitation rights of one
                    weekend a month-
          
                                                                   94.
          
          
          
          BOOM. The doors burst open.   All turn to see Mike and Ed
          storm down the aisle.
          
                              ED
                    I declare a mistrial on the grounds
                    of insufficient evidence and Sacco
                    and Vanzetti!
          
          Scarlet can only shake her head.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Sacco and...what are you....who are
                    you!?
          
                              ED
                    I am legal counsel for Mike
                    O'Donnell and I demand a stay of
                    execution for this marriage, your
                    Majesty.
          
                              SCARLET
                    He's my husband's best friend.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Are you a lawyer, best friend?
          
                              ED
                    No but I have been a defendant in
                    numerous lawsuits so-
          
                               JUDGE
                    Bailiff! Get these 2 out of my
                    courtroom.
          
          The Bailiff grabs Mike and a yelling Ed, drags them toward
          the exit. Mike wiggles free, runs back to the front.
          
                              MIKE
                    Your Honor! I have a letter from
                    Mike O'Donnell. Just let me read
                    it. Please.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I'm sorry, but-
          
                              SCARLET
                    If it's okay, your Honor.   I'd like
                    to hear it.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Make it quick.
          
          Mike digs into his pocket, pulls out a piece of paper.
          
                                                                 95.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    Thank you, your Honor.
                        (READS)
                    September 7th, 1988 was the first
                    time I saw you. You were reading
                    `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a
                    Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never
                    seen anything so perfect. I
                    remember thinking I had to have you
                    or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda
                    way but in that beautiful,
                    innocent, unaffected way that way
                    only a 17 year-old kid can have.
                    You whispered you loved me at the
                    homecoming dance and I felt so
                    peaceful and safe because I knew no
                    matter what happened from that
                    night on nothing could ever be that
                    bad because I had you. And then I
                    grew up, lost my way and blamed you
                    for my failures. But I was never
                    lost. I'd just forgotten the way
                    life makes you forget as you grow
                    older. And I never failed at
                    anything because on that September
                    day you said `yes' to me. And at
                    that dance you said you loved me.
                    And as I stand here...as I write
                    this, I want you to know if I don't
                    have you I'll die...not in a psycho
                    way but in that beautiful,
                    innocent, unaffected way only a 17
                    year old kid can have....oh
                    and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the
                    Wolf'.
          
          Mike places the PAPER ON THE TABLE, looks over to Scarlet.
          Scarlet just stares at him, tears streaming down her
          cheeks...sadness...recognition?
          
                              JUDGE
                    Alright, son, you have to go now.
          
          Mike nods, walks down the aisle and out the door.
          
                              JUDGE (CONT'D)
                    Let's proceed.
          
                              SCARLET
                    Your Honor, Sir. I'm sorry.   I'm
                    in no shape...I need to
                    postpone...I'm sorry.
          
                                                                   96.
          
          
          
          A tearful Scarlet starts to leave, stops, picks up Mike's
          `letter'...DIRECTIONS TO THE COURTHOUSE. She looks back
          confused.
          
          
          INT. BMW CONVERTIBLE - DAY
          
          A solemn Mike stares out the window.    Ed turns the radio off.
          
                              ED
                    Maybe it wasn't a spell of
                    enlightenment.
          
          Mike looks to Ed.
          
                              MIKE
                    What are you talking about?
          
                              ED
                    According to the website once
                    you've learned your lesson you'd
                    turn back. That speech should've
                    broken the spell.
          
                              MIKE
                    Enough with the magic crap, Ed.
          
                              ED
                    You know what this means? You need
                    to let them go. You need to let
                    them get on with their lives and
                    you need to get on with yours.
          
          Mike chokes back tears...because he knows Ed is right.
          
          
          INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
          
          Mike works on his laptop, plugs his iPhone into
          it...downloads pictures.
          
          Mike moves to the bed, packs his Falcons uniform into a
          duffel bag. A BEEP. Mike unplugs the iPhone, types an email
          to Scarlet, "I think this will help your business. Best of
          luck, Mark" Mike hits send, grabs his bag and exits.
          
          
          EXT. ED'S HOUSE - DUSK
          
          Mike steps outside, throws his duffel into the Aston.    Ed
          exits the house.
          
                                                                 97.

                              MIKE
                    I'm moving on. See you at the
                    game.
          
          Mike climbs into the car, pulls out of the driveway.
          
          
          INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DUSK
          
          Scarlet sits at the kitchen table working on her laptop. The
          noise of an incoming email. She clicks over...MARK FREEDMAN.
          
          Scarlet reads Mike's email then clicks on the link. A web
          site pops up...`Scarlet's Sanctuaries'. Scarlet smiles.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT
          
          An empty gym. Mike stands feet beyond the 3 point line,
          grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots.
          SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. Automatic.
          
          Coach Harvey enters.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Hey, Freedman, save some for the
                    game.
          
          Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the coach.
          
                              MIKE
                    Just warming up, Coach.
          
          Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Son, I haven't seen anyone with
                    your shooting ability in, well, in
                    a long time. I called a couple
                    college scouts I know. They're
                    coming to the game tonight...to
                    watch you. If you have half the
                    season I think you're capable of,
                    you can play anywhere you want.
          
                              MIKE
                    That's the plan, Coach.
          
          The rest of the Falcons basketball team jogs out from the
          locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.
          
                                                                 98.

                     Round up, Jock Straps! Picture
                     time.
          
          The Team assembles in the middle of the court. Alex moves
          away from Mike. A PLAYER kneeling in front holds a sign,
          `FITCH FALCONS, 2008.'
          
                                PHOTOGRPAHER
                     3, 2, 1-
          
          FLASH.   And with the flash WE cut to:
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - LATER
          
          A POPULAR SONG rocks the gymnasium. CHEERLEADERS dance on
          the sidelines. STUDENTS and PARENTS cheer wildly from the
          packed stands.
          
          Julie gabs with a group of TEACHERS.
          
          On one end of the court, the Falcons run a pass and shoot
          drill. On the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE shoots around.
          
          Mike sees Scarlet and Maggie enter. He smiles apologetically
          to them. Both turn away, climb the bleachers, join Nicole
          and the Wonder Bras.
          
                               MAGGIE
                         (to Scarlet)
                     I thought he was hanging out with
                     Alex to get to me- not you.
          
          ANGLE...Coach Harvey claps loudly-
          
                               COACH HARVEY
                     Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
          
          The Falcons swarm the bench, take their seats. Mike takes a
          deep breath, sits next to Alex. Alex looks down.
          
                                MIKE
                     ALEX-
          
                               ALEX
                     I have nothing to say to you.
          
                               MIKE
                     I never meant to hurt you-
          
                               ALEX
                     Then why'd you kiss my mom!?
          
                                                                 99.
          
          
          
                               MIKE
                    Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know.
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Alex stands-
          
                              ALEX
                    You're lucky I don't punch you out.
          
          Alex moves down the line, takes another seat.
          
          Ed strides through the door spots Julie, makes his way over
          to her.
          
                              ED
                    Julie, can I talk to you?
          
          Julie excuses herself from the Teachers.
          
                              JULIE
                    What is it, Ed?
          
                              ED
                    I've seen a good friend of mine
                    lose everything that means anything
                    to him. And maybe we'll never be
                    there but...I just really want to
                    play D & D with you.
          
          Julie can't help but smile, sizes Ed up.
          
                              JULIE
                    You can raid my dungeon anytime.
          
                              ED
                    I'll bring my long bow.
          
          A REFEREE blows his whistle.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners
                    get the girls. Losers please
                    themselves!
          
          Mike and the Falcons jog onto the court. Mike takes his
          place for the jump ball. The Crowd stomps, cheers LOUDLY.
          
          Mike looks around the gymnasium...it almost seems to SLOW
          UP...the sound deafening. He finds Alex on the bench...his
          hopeful face. Mike looks into the stands...Maggie and
          Scarlet. Scarlet abruptly stands, climbs back down the
          bleachers and exits the gym.
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
          
          The Ref readies to toss the ball.    Mike takes a deep
          breath...and walks off the court.
          
                              REFEREE
                    Son! Come back here!      You're gonna
                    get a delay of game!
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    This can't be happening again.
          
          Mike steps over to Alex-
          
                              MIKE
                    It's your turn now.    Good luck.
          
          Mike rushes off the court. As Mike disappears into the
          tunnel, WE see the OLD JANITOR amongst the crowd. He smiles.
          
          Coach Harvey turns to Alex-
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Get off your butt, O'Donnell!    Get
                    in there!
          
          Alex leaps off the bench.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
                                 MIKE
                    Scar!
          
          The tunnel is EMPTY.    Crestfallen, Mike lowers his head...
          
          ANGLE ON: Scarlet as she appears at the far end of the
          tunnel.
          
                              SCARLET
                    What took you so long?
          
          ANGLE ON: Mike and he's 36 years-old again, bursting out of
          his uniform.
          
                              MIKE
                    The best choice I ever made was
                    you.
          
          Scarlet and Mike walk towards one another, picking up their
          pace the closer they get.
          
                              SCARLET
                    How did this happ-
          
                                                                101.
          
          
          
          Mike wraps his arms around her.
          
                                 MIKE
                    Don't ask.
          
          They lock lips.
          
          Mike takes Scarlet's hand and as they walk out of the tunnel-
          
                              MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's best if we don't tell
                    the kids about this. Especially
                    Maggie.

          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a
          park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says
          a word.
          
          
          CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No
          words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
          to be looked at.
          
          A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.

          The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular
          conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up
          sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-
          shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
          balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.

                    The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New
                    Jersey, grew up believing that he'd
                    never truly be happy until the day
                    he met his... "soulmate."

          PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His
          walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,
          we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!"

                    This belief stemmed from early
                    exposure to sad British pop music
                    and a total misreading of the
                    movie, "The Graduate."

                    Since the disintegration of her
                    parents' marriage, she'd only loved
                    two things. The first was her long
                    blonde hair.
          
          She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.

                    The second was how easily she could
                    cut it off... And feel nothing.

                    Come on Hansen. You'll be ok.
                    You're the best guy I know. You'll
                    find someone.

                    You know what they say...there's
                    plenty other fish in the sea.
          
                               TOM
                    No.
          
                              PAUL
                    Sure they do. They say that.
          
                              TOM
                    Well they're wrong. It's not true.
                    I've fished in that sea. I've
                    jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm
                    fucking Aquaman!
                        (to Rachel)
                    Sorry. What I mean is... there are
                    no other fish. This was my fish.
          
          Paul and McKenzie share a very concerned look.

          Tom as we saw him earlier. Bored. In the boardroom. Mckenzie
          is in mid-presentation.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Now I know this may be a little
                    risque...but if New Hampshire
                    Greetings wants the jump on those
                    conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis
                    at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe
                    is the wrong approach. The nuclear
                    family is dead and we need a new
                    holiday to recognize that.
          
          Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of

                    May 21st. Other Mother's Day.
          
          The co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of
          the department.
          
                              VANCE
                    Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea
                    McKenzie. Along with Grossman's
                    "Magellan Day" I'd say we've got
                    some potential here. What do you
                    think Hansen? Could you write up
                    some prototypes for these?
          
          Tom is about to answer when... the door opens.

                    Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a
                    call for you on line 3.
          
          And in walks this girl. Summer. We've met her by now but Tom
          hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from
          that moment on, he can't take them off her.

                    Right. Michigan. Well, Summer,

                    Nice to meet you all.
          
          Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out.
          
          She doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen

                    I'm happy. Still getting situated.

          Really? Jesus. Did you always want
          to write greeting cards?
          
                     TOM
          Are you nuts? I don't even want to
          do it now.

          What is it you want to do?
          
                    TOM
          I studied to be an architect
          actually.
          
                    SUMMER
          That's so cool! What happened?
          
                    TOM
          Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved
          to the city to work for a company.
          Company went under. Needed a job.
          My friend worked here. Got me this.
          
                    SUMMER
          And are you any good?

          Oh... No. I doubt it.

          Well, I'd say you're a perfectly

          writer.

                    Why thank you. That's what they
                    called me in college. "Perfectly
                    adequate" Hansen.

          There's an awkward silence.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Anyway, I should get back.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok, well, I'll see you around.
          
          She walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall.
          Tom watches her walk away, completely enamored.
          
          He sits down at his desk and sets out to work. But before he
          does, his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house. It's
          dated 2001 and it's the only architecture sketch on his wall.

                    Right. And I still like it, don't
                    get me wrong. It's just... When I

                    It's off.
          
                                PAUL
                    What?

                    Was it ever on?
          
                                                           25.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    No. But it could have been. In a
                    world where good things happen to
                    me.
          
                              PAUL
                    Yeah well, that's not really where
                    we live.
          
                                TOM
                    No.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So what happened?
          
                              TOM
                    You ready for this?

                              TOM (V.O.)
                    So there we are. All alone. Nine
                    more floors to ride. Plenty of
                    time. I figure...this is my chance.
                    If not now when, right?
          
          They ride in silence for a few beats.

                    It was good.

                              PAUL
                    I think I missed something.
          
                               TOM
                    "It was good." She didn't say "It
                    was good." She said "It was good."
                    Emphasis on the good. She basically
                    said "I spent the weekend having
                    sex with this guy I met at the
                    gym." Fucking whore. Screw her.
                    It's over.
          
          Everyone's silent.

                    Dude, you got problems.
          
                              TOM
                    She's not interested in me. There's
                    nothing I can do.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Based on..."it was good?"
                              TOM
                    And some other things.
          
                              PAUL
                    Like what, she said "hey" instead
                    of "hi" cause that totally means
                    she's a lesbian.
          
                              TOM
                    I gave her all sorts of chances.

          There's a beat.

          The office is emptying out. Only a few people remain but Tom
          and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put
          a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's "I
          Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner. No reaction from
          Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down,
          defeated.
          
          
          INT SUMMER'S DESK
          
          Tom is there.
          
                              TOM
                    Do you want to go out with me?
          
          A beat. Summer says nothing.
          
                              TOM
                    And the Priest says, "But we're
                    already out!"
          
          They both laugh.
          
                              SUMMER
                    That is hilarious!
          
                              TOM
                    I know!
          
          And when she walks away, he smacks his head a few times with
          his palm.

          Tom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work. But
          with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard
          time concentrating.

                              TOM
                    Not at all. You just threw up on
                    the stage, tried to fight the
                    bartender, and then threatened to
                    burn the place down before passing
                    out on the sidewalk. Quiet night
                    for you.

                    This is a work thing, Tommy. It
                    won't be like that. The whole
                    office is going.
          
                              TOM
                    I really can't. Even if I wanted
                    to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta
                    take care of.
          
                              MCKENZIE

                              MCKENZIE
                    The whole office is going.
          Tom looks over to where Summer sits. And realization dawns on
          him...
          
          
          INT KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
          
          Summer is in a back booth with some co-workers when Tom walks
          in to the crowded place. McKenzie has the microphone and he's
          singing "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison. He's real into
          it and, well, it's kinda sad. Tom waves to McKenzie and walks
          over to the booth.
          
                              TOM
                    Hi.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Hey! They said you weren't coming.
          
                               TOM
                    You asked if I was coming?
                        (BEAT)
                    I mean...my plans got cancelled...
          
          Tom is at a loss. There's yet another awkward silent beat
          between them. Thankfully, it's interrupted by...
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (already drunk)
                    Goddamn that song is brilliant!
                    What's up Hansen?
          
          Summer sees the next song come up on the screen.
          
                                                                  30.

                    Ooh that's me.
          
          She downs a shot and jumps up on stage.
          
                               SUMMER
                        (into mic)
                    Ok. I'm the new girl so no making
                    fun of me.
          
          Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep
          breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and
          Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in
          whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's
          something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a
          midget in a tuxedo.)
          
          LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as
          Summer chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can't help
          but stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles,
          hopeful that she'll come over. She doesn't. He hides his
          disappointment.
          
          LATER. Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is
          there in mid-conversation with McKenzie.
          
                              TOM
                    You were great up there, by the
                    way.

                    I hear that.
          
                              MCKENZIE

          She laughs. She's really cute when she laughs.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So you got a boyfriend?
          
                               SUMMER
                    Me? No.
          
          Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment. McKenzie
          mouths "what?" Summer sees nothing.
          
                               MCKENZIE
                    Why not?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Don't really want one.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Come on. I don't believe that.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You don't believe a woman could
                    enjoy being free and independent?
          
                               MCKENZIE
                        (BEAT)
                    Are you a lesbian?
          
                              SUMMER
                    No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not
                    comfortable being somebody's
                    "girlfriend." I don't want to be
                    anybody's anything, you know?
                              MCKENZIE
                    I have no idea what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It sounds selfish, I know, but... I
                    just like being on my own.
                    Relationships are messy and
                    feelings are always getting hurt.
                    Who needs all that? We're young.
                    We're in one of the most beautiful
                    cities in the world.

                              SUMMER (cont'd)
                    I say, let's have as much fun as we
                    can afford and leave the serious
                    shit for later.
          
                              TOM
                    But...what if you meet someone and
                    fall in love?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (LAUGHS)
                    Love? You seriously believe in that
                    stuff?
          
                              TOM
                    Of course I do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Interesting. A real romantic.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Oh you have no idea. This one...
                    embarrassing. There was this one
                    girl,
                        (to Tom)
                    I gotta tell this story --
          
          Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.
          
                              TOM
                    Summer, hold on... you don't
                    believe in love?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I don't even know what that word
                    means. I know I've never felt it,
                    whatever it is in all those songs.
                    And I know that today most
                    marriages end in divorce. Like my
                    parents.
          
                              TOM
                    Well mine too but --
          
                              SUMMER
                    Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek,
                    there were these scientists who
                    found that by stimulating a part of
                    the brain with electrodes you can
                    make a person fall in "love" with a
                    rock. Is that the love you're
                    talking about?
          
                              TOM
                    Well...
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    Why, what's your take on it?
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY
          DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN
          ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO.
          
                                                           BACK TO:

          On Tom:
          
                              TOM
                    I think it's...kind of a huge
                    thing.
          
                               SUMMER
                        (BEAT)
                    Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to
                    agree to disagree on that one.
          
          McKenzie senses some discontent.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So, uh, who's singing next?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (re: singing)
                    I'd say it's your turn loverboy.
          
                              TOM
                    Nooo. I don't sing in public.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sure you do. I see you lip-synching
                    to your headphones every morning on
                    your way in.
          
                                 TOM
                    I don't...
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    You really do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of
                    self-confidence to look ridiculous.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (can't help himself)
                    Self-confidence! Ha!
          
          Tom elbows him in the ribs again.
          
                              TOM
                    Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough
                    to sing in front of all these
                    people.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok then. Let's drink.
          
                              TOM
                    It would take at least ten shots to
                    get me to sing.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Bartender!
          
          TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's
          "Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK
          STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in
          the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts.
          It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching.
          
          LATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming
          something.
          
                              TOM
                    That's not it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    What is that then?
          
                              TOM
                    I have no idea.
          
          They're both having a good time.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I used to watch it every week.
          
                              TOM
                    Me too. Why can't we think of the
                    stupid A-Team theme song.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Pathetic.
          
                              TOM
                    This is gonna bother me for weeks.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Totally.
          
          They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good
          way.
          
          ANGLE ON McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "Proud to
          Be an American." He really means it. At any minute he might
          start to cry.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    "And I'd proudly stand UP!"
                        (aggressive drunk)
                    I said stand!
          
          BACK ON TOM and SUMMER.
          
                              TOM
                    Oh here we go.
          
          
          EXT KARAOKE BAR - LATER
          
          Tom helps a nearly comatose McKenzie exit the place. Summer
          is with them.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (to Summer)
                    This guy.
                        (DRAMATICALLY)
                    He's the best.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok, let's get you in a cab.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    No. I'm gonna walk. I live right
                    down that street. Or that one.
          
                              SUMMER
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Is he gonna be ok?
          
                              TOM
                    He'll be fine.
          
          A cab arrives. Tom and Summer help McKenzie inside.
          
                                 MCKENZIE
                    Hey.
          
                                 TOM
                    What's up?
          
                                                                    36.
          
          
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Not you. You.
                        (beat, to Summer)
                    He likes you.
          
                              TOM
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Ok, goodnight McKenzie!
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    I mean... likes you, likes you. For
                    real. Tell her Tom.
          
          Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it's
          just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and
          erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry you had to see that. Happens
                    every time we come here. It's
                    unbelievable. Something about that
                    guy and singing for people. I don't
                    know. But at least he didn't --
          
                              SUMMER
                    Is that true?
          
                              TOM
                    What?
          
                              SUMMER
                    You know what. Do you...like me?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    As a friend.
          
                              TOM
                    Right. As a friend.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Just as a friend?
          
          The wheels are spinning in Tom's head. What's the right
          answer here?
          
                              TOM
                    Yes. I mean... I haven't really
                    thought about... Yes. Why?
          
                                                                     37.

                     Nothing. I just... You're
                     interesting. I'd like us to be
                     friends. Is that ok?
          
          Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He
          hides his disappointment the best he can.
          
                               TOM
                     Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and
                     me. That's... perfect.
          
                               SUMMER
                     Cool.
          
                               TOM
                     Cool.
          
          Silence.
          
                               SUMMER
                     Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.
          
                               TOM
                     G'night Summer.
          
          Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go
          the other way.
          
                               TOM
                         (under his breath)
                     Friends. Awesome. That's just
                     great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.
          
          Tom walks a few more steps.
          
          And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even
          noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED
          HIM INTO A KISS!
          
          It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure
          if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out
          of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually
          happening.

          EXT STREET - MORNING
          
          It's the greatest morning of all time!
          
          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts
          down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,
          winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
          his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.
          
          People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.
          A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the
          HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody
          loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom
          singing the song.
          
          Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also
          pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last
          night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
          every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean".
          
          CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at
          them.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - SAME
          
          Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees
          him and immediately lights up.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Hey!
          
                                 TOM
                    Hey!
          
          Vance pokes out of his corner office.
          
                              VANCE.
                    Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey Mr. Vance.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yes, Mr. Vance?
          
          And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer
          gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make
          anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal
          for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it.
          Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          
          
          INT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT
          
          Tom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs).
          
                              PAUL
                    You son of a bitch.
          
          He walks inside without waiting for an invite.
          
                              PAUL
                    Last night, karaoke night?
          
                              TOM
                        (ANXIOUS)
                    Shhh.
          
                               PAUL
                    The same girl you'd been whining
                    and crying and bitching about for
                    weeks now?
          
                              TOM
                    I have not been...
          
                              PAUL
                    The same girl you said was way out
                    of your league and you'd have no
                    chance with no matter what. That
                    girl?
          
                              TOM
                    Paul, seriously...
          
                              PAUL
                    Did you bang her?
          
                                TOM
                    No!
          
                                PAUL
                    Blow job?
          
                                TOM
                    No!
          
                                PAUL
                    Hand job?
          
                              TOM
                    No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still
                    unemployed. We just kissed.
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    Come on, level with me. As your
                    best friend, who tolerated a whole
                    month of talk talk talk about this
                    girl, nothing but Summer this,
                    Summer that, Summer Summer Summer,
                    I mean you were practically
                    stalking her...
          
                               TOM
                    Shhh!
          
          Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the
          bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out.
          
                               PAUL
                    Oh crap.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Hi, I'm Summer..
          
                              PAUL
                    Summer, wow what an unusual name.
                    I'm sure I'd remember that if I had
                    heard it before. Tom, how come
                    you've never mentioned you knew
                    such a lovely little lady?
                        (off Tom's nasty look)
                    Or perhaps you have and I've just
                    forgot.
                        (to Summer)
                    I mean, with all the women in Tom's
                    life it's hard to keep track...
                        (not helping)
                    Ok, well, I was just... I'm Paul.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Hi Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                        (not sure what else to
                         SAY)
                    I'm a doctor.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Nice to meet you.
          
                              PAUL
                    Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I
                    was never here. Tom, talk to you
                    later?... Hey, If any jobs open
                    up...
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
          
          Tom quickly shuts the door on Paul.
          
                              TOM
                    If you heard...
          
                              SUMMER
                    Heard what?
          
                              TOM
                    Excellent. You ready to go.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm stalking, STARVING!
          
          Tom realizes she's heard it all.
          
                              TOM
                        (PLAYFULLY)
                    He exaggerates!
          
          
          (198)
          INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Summer eating, not really talking much. At another
          table, Tom sees a VERY UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE feeding each other
          food.
          
                              TOM
                    Check them out.
          
          Summer sees. She has no reaction.
          
                              TOM
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    That is hot.
          
          Summer keeps eating.
          
                              TOM
                    I am very turned on right now.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sometimes you can be so judgmental.
          
                                 TOM
                    Huh?
          
                                                                  42.

                    I mean, who are you? They're happy.
                    Just mind your own business.
          
          Summer goes back to eating. Tom can't believe she snapped.

          INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          An equally UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE go at it in a booth. PAN
          ACROSS to find Tom and Summer early in their relationship, in
          a booth across the room, watching in hysterics.

                              SUMMER
                    Too soon to say. It's all in the
                    dismount.
          
                              TOM
                    If we're lucky, there won't be a
                    dismount.
          
          Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it
          again. They are having a great night.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't believe them. I have like
                    zero patience for PDA.
          
                              TOM
                    I hear ya. If I want to watch
                    people make out, I have big windows
                    and binoculars at home.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah?
          
                               TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    No. That would be wrong.
          
          They laugh some more. She is in hysterics.
          
                              SUMMER

                    I mean, I just want to say, up
                    front, I'm not looking for anything
                    serious.
          
          Tom is a little surprised.

                    labels, no obligations.
                        (BEAT)
                    Ok?
          
          Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it.
          
                              TOM
                    Sure.

                    Wanna hold my hand under the table?
          
          A beat.
          
                              TOM

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          Summer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each
          other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other.
          Suddenly, Tom stops.
          
                                                                    44.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    I'll be...back in a sec.
          
          He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into
          the hallway mirror.
          
                              TOM
                    Settle. Don't get too excited.
                    She's just a girl. There's lots of
                    them. Who look like that. And like
                    what you like. They're everywhere.
                    Calm yourself.
          
          He takes a few deep breaths.
          
                               TOM
                    Are you calm?
                        (BEAT)
                    Ok. Then it's time to go back in.
          
          We watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom. Where
          Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked.
          
                              SUMMER

          Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          LATER. Sex has been had. Summer is asleep. Tom lies next to
          her. He still can't help but be ecstatic. He is pumping his
          fists in the air and silently shouting "Woo Hoo!!!!"

          painting of two dogs humping. He stops and retrieves it from
          the bin like it's some family heirloom. He gives the
          secretary a dirty look for tossing it.

                    church. The beauty of St. Patrick's
                    is its humility. With this giant
                    mirror thing deflecting all the

          Summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of
          her arm. Tom thinks about this. Then he starts to draw a
          sketch on her skin. We catch her watching his face as he
          draws. She's attracted to his enthusiasm.

                    Cause nobody loves Ringo.

                    Is she your girlfriend?

                    I wouldn't say that.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    What would you say?
          
                              TOM
                    Like, are we "going steady?" Come
                    on, guys. We're adults.

                    It's not an unreasonable question.

                              MCKENZIE
                    No I do not. In fact girls are
                    repulsed by me. Paul, how about
                    you?

                    Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is
                    Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.
          
                              TOM
                    It is when you've been with the
                    same girl since high school.

                    Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we
                    know how we feel. We don't need to
                    label it. "Boyfriend, girlfriend."

                    Well let me ask you this then. Do
                    you want her to be your girlfriend?

                    I heard her Hansen. She's not the
                    girlfriend type. You're gonna need
                    to discuss it.
          
                              TOM
                    No. We're adults. It'll be fine.

          watching from behind the players' bench. A whistle blows and
          Rachel comes back and sits down.
          
                              RACHEL
                    You were saying?
          
                              TOM
                    My thinking is... why rock the
                    boat? Things are going well. If we
                    start putting labels on it, that's
                    like the kiss of death. Like saying
                    to a girl "I love you."

                    happened with me and Sean.

                    Yeah but, you know me. This is the
                    kinda stuff that always gets me in
                    trouble.

                    Hmm. So, basically you do want to
                    ask the question, `are we
                    boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just
                    afraid you'll get an answer you
                    don't want and that will shatter
                    your illusions of how good
                    everything's been these past few
                    months. Is that about right?

                    to get the wrong answer now... or
                    find out in a month she has a date
                    coming up with Lars from Norway?

          Tom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very
          conflicted and we can see it in his face. They're silent a
          few beats, before:
          
                                SUMMER
                    Hi.
          
                                TOM
                    Hi.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Are you ok?
          
                                TOM
                    Yeah.
          
                                SUMMER
                    You sure?
          
          He's not. He clenches his teeth. And begins...
          
                               TOM
                    Summer, I've gotta ask you
                    something.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when:
          
                                SUMMER
                    Wait!
          
          Summer finds on the radio a particular song. ("Waiting in
          Vain" by Bob Marley, if you must know.)
          
                               SUMMER
                    Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk
                    during this song. It's too
                    beautiful.
          
          And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers
          there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches
          Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the
          way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain
          notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry
          at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply
          overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this
          girl.
          
                                                                    57.

                    grief/ but your love is my relief."
          
          We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight.

          INT PARTY - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party.
          TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with,
          drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom
          notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's
          clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention
          they're getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that
          attention.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          (272-286)
          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
          
          Tom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders
          through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the
          titles. He grabs just about every one of them.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his
          bed. He reads from one called "Six Steps to Getting Over
          Him."
          
                              TOM (V.O.)
                    "So he broke your heart. You've
                    been sad and depressed for weeks.
                    Perhaps you've turned to drinking
                    or even drugs. And nothing's
                    helped. Now what? Should you binge
                    on rocky road and watch soaps all
                    day?"
          
          SECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He
          continues to read.
          
                                                                     58.
          
          
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "No you should not."
          
          He slowly puts the ice cream down.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Through extensive research, we
                      have found the six most effective
                      ways to get over that lost love and
                      make room in your heart for a new
                      man to fill. Those steps are:"
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Tom jogs.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "One. Exercise. The body's release
                      of endorphins will assuage the
                      brain and provide a genuine sense
                      of accomplishment and success."
          
          Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child
          on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in
          place.
          
          
          INT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT
          
          Tom is taking a yoga class.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Two. Physical and Mental

                      energies to the core of your being
                      for a new understanding of the self
                      and others."
          
          This shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as
          Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't
          even get the breathing right.
          
          
          INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY
          
          Tom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the
          homeless.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Three. Charity. Reach out! You are
                      not alone in your pain."
          
                                                                  59.
          
          
          
          Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits
          immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other.
          
          
          INT SHOE STORE - DAY
          
          Tom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you
                      know you want to. Indulge!"
          
          ANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't
          really want new shoes.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
          
          Tom backpacks alone in the forest.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Five. Travel. Take some time to
                      see another environment. Get
                      perspective. It's a beautiful
                      world. It will be for you again
                      someday."
          
          This is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to
          the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and
          takes a deep breath.
          
          FREEZE ON TOM.
          
          INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that
          Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a
          step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up
          behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER
          has Tom sized up in his rifle sight.
          
          UNFREEZE.
          
          Tom starts to itch...
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Six. Redecorate. Start anew."
          
          He's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it.
          
                                                                    60.

                    will have discovered your inner
                    strength and should be ready to
                    move on. I bet you can hardly
                    remember his face at all."
          
          We pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of
          Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and
          dropkicks it.

          INT CROWDED BAR - NIGHT
          
          Summer and Tom stand by the bar.
          
                              TOM
                    I just don't get women's fashion
                    nowadays. Everybody with the
                    tattoos, the giant hoop earrings,
                    those annoying hats. Explain this
                    to me.

                    Do you?

                    On some.
          
                              TOM
                    I like how you dress.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah? What if I started wearing
                    berets and got a huge butterfly
                    tattoo on my leg?

          A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly
          appeared next to them.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          
                                 DOUCHE
                           (to Summer)
                    Hey.
          
          Tom and Summer stop talking.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Hey.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    How's it going?
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange
          go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more
          amused than concerned.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    You live around here?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah not too far.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    I've never seen you here before.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You're not too perceptive.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Ha. That's funny.
          
          Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry
          about.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
          
                              SUMMER
                    No thank you.
          
          As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The
          Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of
          them together.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Are you with this guy?
          
          Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.
          
                                                                     62.
          
          
          
                               TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    Hi. I'm Tom.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Whatever.
                        (to Summer)
                    Come on, one drink. What are you
                    drinking?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sorry, no thank you.
          
          Tom is pleased.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    You're serious? This guy?
          
          And now he's pissed.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey buddy --
          
                               SUMMER
                        (to the Douche)
                    Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm
                    just not interested. Now why don't
                    you go back over there and leave us
                    alone, ok?
          
                              DOUCHE
                    It's a free country.
          
          Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now
          what?" After a beat:
          
                              DOUCHE
                    So you and him, huh? I can't
                    believe that. Is this guy really
                    your boyfriend?
          
          And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to
          cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,
          coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the
          woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost
          automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.
          
          Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.
          
          Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's
          fist).
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
          There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised.
          And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
          
          Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is
          a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it.
          
                              TOM
                    Did you see that punch? I don't
                    know where it came from. I haven't
                    punched someone since Josh
                    Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm
                    gonna have to throw out this shirt.
          
          Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first
          time she's furious.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey. What is it?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't believe you.
          
                              TOM
                    What?
          
                              SUMMER
                    You were so completely uncool in
                    there.
          
                              TOM
                    You're mad at me? I just got my ass
                    kicked for you.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Oh that was for me? You were, what,
                    protecting me? Next time Tommy,
                    don't. I fight my own battles.
          
                              TOM
                    Come on, that guy was an asshole!
          
                              SUMMER
                    You didn't have to hit him. Why
                    didn't you just let me handle it?
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know. He was --
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    See. This is why I don't want a
                    serious relationship.
          
                              TOM
                    Whoa. What was that?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I
                    like this. What we've been doing.
                    But maybe it's gone too...
          
                                TOM
                    What...?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I told you all along what I don't
                    want and it's...
          
          Tom waits for more. It doesn't come.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm tired. Can we talk about this
                    tomorrow?
          
          It's silent. He doesn't know what to do or say or think.
          Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways.
          
                              TOM
                        (calling to her)
                    I just got my ass kicked!
          
          Only the CROWD outside the bar hear this.
          
                              TOM
                        (to Onlookers)
                    I got one good shot in.

          INT. OFFICE - LATER
          
          Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose.
          Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there. She stops
          short.

                                   TOM
                    What's up?
          
                                   SUMMER
                    Nothing.
          
                                   TOM
                    Ok.
          
          Nothing else is said.
          
                              TOM
                    Wait, are you still mad at me?

                              TOM
                    Holy shit you are. I can't believe
                    you!
          
                              SUMMER

                    Are you almost done?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah. I'm all done.
          
          He starts to walk out.
          
                              TOM
                    You know what... Sometimes you
                    really don't make any sense.
          
          Tom walks out. He looks back but she isn't looking. When she
          looks back at him, he's gone.
          
          LATER. Tom about to leave the office. Passes Summer's desk.
          She's on the phone. He wants to stop and say something but
          she's busy. He walks on. She never knew he was there.
          
          LATER. Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle
          but he's already gone.

          Left: Tom picks up the phone. Is about to dial when he stops
          himself and hangs up.
          
          Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring. It
          doesn't.
          
          
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER
          
          Tom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the "sleep" button but
          the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm. It's his door. He
          gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Say you're sorry.
          
                               TOM
                    Huh?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Say you're sorry for acting like a
                    jerk.
          
                              TOM
                    I am. I'm sorry for acting like a
                    jerk.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok. Me too.
          
                              TOM
                    Summer... we don't have to label
                    what we're doing. I just... I need -
          
                               SUMMER
                    I know -
          
                              TOM
                    Consistency. I need to know you
                    won't wake up tomorrow and feel a
                    different way.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't promise you that. Nobody
                    can. Anyone who does is a liar.
          
          A beat.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can only tell you how I feel
                    right now... or I can show you.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
          
          She comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second.
          Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins
          again. He shuts the door in our faces.
          
          
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Tom and Summer in the wee hours.
          
                              TOM
                    Have you ever had a real
                    "boyfriend?"
          
                                 SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    A boyfriend. "Going steady."
                    Whatever. You know what I mean.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Well... yeah.
          
                              TOM
                    More than one?
          
                                 SUMMER
                    A few.
          
                              TOM
                    Tell me about them.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Oh no way.
          
                                 TOM
                    Why?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Cause there's nothing to tell.
          
                              TOM
                    Come on, I'm interested.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You wanna have the relationship
                    history conversation?
          
                                 TOM
                    Yes.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You sure about that?
          
                                                                    68.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I
                    can take it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok. Well, in high school, there was
                    Markus.

          appears in Tom's mind. Arm cocked, about to throw the winning

                              SUMMER
                    He was a rower. Very hot.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened to Markus?
          
                              SUMMER
                    He works for the Republican party.
                    Very successful. Just not for me.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok. And then?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Well, for a short time in college,
                    there was Kurt.
          
          INSERT: Still photograph of KURT. As Tom envisions him.
          Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue.

                    That didn't really go anywhere.

                    Yeah, cause, you know...
          
          Tom has no idea. And he doesn't want to know.
          
                                                                  69.

                    The ones that lasted.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened? Why didn't they work

                              SUMMER
                    Nothing happened really. It's what
                    always happens. Life.
          
          On TOM. Silent for a few beats. Did he want to hear that?

          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Tom, unshaven, un-showered, walks by himself. He turns a
          corner and sees Summer walking towards him. As she gets
          closer he sees it's not her after all and breathes a sigh of
          relief.
          
          
          INT. BEDROOM - LATER

          Tom and an attractive girl we haven't seen before walk
          towards an outdoor cafe. Her name is ALLISON. It's clear
          right away that Tom can't wait for this night to end already.
          
                                                          70.
          
          
          
                              ALISON
                    So how long have you known Paul and
                    Robyn?
          
                              TOM
                    Since grade school.
          
                              ALISON
                    No way, really? That's crazy.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah.
          
                              ALISON
                    Well I'm glad you called. They
                    spoke very highly of you.
          
                              TOM
                    Great.
          
          
          INT RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Tom and Alison eat. In silence.
          
                              ALISON
                    So...uh... how's it going?
          
                              TOM
                    Ok.
          
          Beat.
          
                              ALISON
                    You've been pretty quiet.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry.
          
                              ALISON
                    I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's
                    nice sometimes to be comfortable
                    enough that you can just sit and
                    eat and not have to say anything,
                    you know?
          
                              TOM
                    Uh-huh.
          
          More silence.
          
                              ALISON
                    Do you want to try some --
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          
                                 TOM
                    No thanks.
          
          Alison looks at her food. Tom realizes he's been difficult,
          starts to feel kinda bad.
          
                               TOM
                    I'm sorry. It's just... there's
                    this girl.
          
                                 ALISON
                    Oh.
          
                              TOM
                    I'm not usually like this. I wasn't
                    before... Long story short, she
                    wrecked me. I don't know if you can
                    tell but it was pretty recent and
                    I'm still kinda thinking about her.
          
                              ALISON
                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Well maybe you should think
                    about... someone else... who could
                    cheer you up.
          
                              TOM
                    I can't get her out of my head, you
                    know? I see her everywhere. She's
                    all I think about. And it's
                    horrible. Cause I totally didn't
                    see it coming. I thought things
                    were fine. So now I keep going
                    through every day in my mind, every
                    second really. Wondering. What went
                    wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have
                    prevented it somehow?
          
          
          EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - (BACK ON DAY 51)
          
          Summer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the
          buildings.
          
                              TOM
                    A lot of people have problems with
                    this, but to me, it makes both
                    structures so much more beautiful
                    side by side like that.
          
          Tom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the
          CAMERA.
          
                                                                  72.

                    While you continue to talk about
                    buildings and whatever other
                    bullshit interests you, I'll just
                    nod my head and pretend to listen
                    while secretly dreaming about the
                    many ways I can one day rip out
                    your heart and eat it like the
                    rabid vampire I am.

                              TOM
                    Maybe there were things I could
                    have said or done, you know?
          
          INT SUMMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - (FROM DAY 39)
          
          From the scene in which Tom and Summer first slept together.
          He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had
          in a long while. Summer lies next to him. Wide awake. Bored
          and unfulfilled.
          
          
          INT RESTAURANT - SAME
          
          Tom and Alison. Alison is desperately trying to get a drink.

                    Waiter!
          
                              TOM
                    Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe
                    she was never that interested in me
                    to begin with.

                        (winks at him)
                    It was good.
          
                                                                  73.

                              TOM
                    Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting
                    strange, that's why.
          
                              ALISON
                    It's ok. I'm sure it's tough
                    getting over an ex-girlfriend.
          
                              TOM
                    Actually she was never my
                    girlfriend.
          
          Now Alison is really confused. And it's right around the part
          where Tom starts totally cracking up.
          
                              TOM
                    I just... I thought I'd have
                    figured it out by now, you know? My
                    life. Where I'm going, where I want
                    to end up, who with. All that
                    stuff. I still don't know anything.
                    And the thing is... When I was with
                    Summer, none of that mattered. I
                    never even noticed how much of my
                    life was missing! Isn't that weird?
          
                              ALISON
                    You were in love, that's what it
                    does. But, now that you know where
                    the holes are you can start to fill
                    them.
          
                               TOM
                    Sure.

                              TOM
                    So what do you think? Did I do
                    something? Did I not do something?
                    What can I do now?

          Tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out. A punkish
          pop song plays in the b.g. that he occasionally boogies down
          to. He's excited.
          
          He tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He
          brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and
          plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into
          the mirror.
          
          Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street.

                    tonight... I think I might just
                    stay in and go to bed early.

                      I kinda like what Nietzsche said:
                      "There is always some madness in
                      love, but there is also...always
                      some reason in madness." Think
                      about it. Pretty smart. Although,
                      Nietzsche also said "Kill the
                      Jews." So there's that.

                    the love of my life. I love you."
                    That's very nice. I was thinking
                    though, why not try something
                    like... "Everyday that we don't
                    meet is meaningless and
                    incomplete." You know, spice it up
                    a little.

                    Oh shit.

                    Hi Mom.
          
          Summer smiles. Maybe this will be ok.
          
                              TOM
                    Mom, Martin, this is Summer.
          
                              SARAH
                    Summer! Well hello! We've heard so
                    much about you! It's so good to

                    You too.
          
          And now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices
          Summer's face growing increasingly concerned. Why is he
          hugging me?
          
                              MARTIN
                        (to Tom)
                    Is this the girlfriend?
          
          Tom is caught like a deer in headlights. What can he do?
          
                              TOM
                    Well this is the girl friend I've
                    told you about. I don't know if
                    "girlfriend" is the right word...
          
                              SARAH
                    You going to see the serial killer
                    one?

                    Yes we are.
          
                              SARAH
                    Great! Should we save you seats?
          
          Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for
          Summer.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Absolutely.

                    Ok. We'll see you inside.
          
          When they're out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is
          distraught.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry about that.

                              SUMMER
                    They seemed to think... I mean, why
                    is your step-dad giving me a hug?
          
                              TOM
                    He's very...loving.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Does he hug all your friends?
          
          There's that word again.
          
          Summer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at
          him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the
          theatre. He's forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as
          ever. Why is none of this easy?
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
          
          Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold,
          emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact,
          something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her
          head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.
          
          ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          
          It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen
          assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets
          fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away
          like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent,
          horrible on-screen death.
          
          
          (228)
          INT CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking
          miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not
          really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with
          everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with
          sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You're not having any fun.
          
                              TOM
                    You're having enough for both of
                    us.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm dancing. I haven't danced in
                    ages. God. Come on.
          
                              TOM
                    No.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Come on! I wanna dance with you.
          
                              TOM
                    Where were you an hour ago? I might
                    have danced then. I've been
                    standing here by myself this whole
                    time and you didn't look over once.
          
                              SUMMER
                    So you're pissed?
          
                              TOM
                    I'm not pissed. Summer... you know
                    I hate this shit.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Then why are you here?
          
                                                                     84.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    This is what you wanted to do
                    so...we're doing it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah well, I didn't need a
                    chaperone. Go home. You're a
                    buzzkill standing there pouting.
          
                               TOM
                        (HURT)
                    That's real nice.
          
          He walks off. She feels some guilt for a second.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Tom!
          
          But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and
          starts dancing again.
          
          LATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the
          music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is
          alone. He can't believe it's come to this.

          FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
          
          
          EXT STREET - MORNING
          
          The worst morning ever.
          
          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks
          down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,
          broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still
          Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.
          He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's
          brother Clint looks back.
          
          Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.
          
          He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He
          doesn't even stop.
          
          Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.
          
          The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for
          directions. He doesn't even look up.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
          
          Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all
          of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks.
          The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom
          tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - SAME
          
          He passes Summer desk on the way in. She's no longer there.
          He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends
          up just staring into space.
          
          
          INT VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Tom has been called into the Principal's office.

                    Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me
                    have been a little difficult.

          He hands him some sympathy cards.

          Tom wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls
          onto the floor and begins a brief push-up routine.

                    Most days of the year are entirely
                    unremarkable. They begin and they
                    end without creating a single
                    lasting memory. Most days have no
                    real impact on the course of a
                    life.
          
          The phone rings. Tom stops his push-ups to answer it.

          INT DELI - DAY
          
          Tom walks in to find Paul and McKenzie at a table. They look
          extremely nervous.
          
                              TOM
                    What's going on?
          
          Neither one answers him. They look at each other. Finally...

                    We have news.

                              TOM
                    Do I want to hear it?
          
                              PAUL

                              MCKENZIE
                    So maybe it's best we don't ever
                    bring her up again.
          
                              PAUL
                    Just let sleeping dogs lie.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Leave those dogs alone Tom!
          
                              TOM
                    You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate
                    what you're saying and, thank you,
                    really, for putting up with me
                    these past few months. I've been
                    crazy. But I've accepted the fact
                    that she and I were just two very
                    different people who wanted very
                    different things. I wanted to get
                    serious. Shit, I loved her. And I
                    know now, she just isn't the kind
                    of girl who can settle down with
                    one person and be happy. The way I
                    wanted. And she probably never
                    will. There was nothing I could do.
          
          Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than
          ever. On Tom, we:

                    It is.

                    How do you know?
          
          On Tom's pained face we...

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          Tom is going apeshit in his room. He's ripping down posters,
          taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He
          punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He
          tries to find something to kick and can't. He throws his cell
          phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          The half-destroyed alarm clock goes off. Tom hits the off
          button.
          
          
          (385)
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          Same exact thing.
          
          
          (386)
          INT SUPERMARKET - DAY
          
          Tom, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, OJ, cigarettes,
          Jack Daniels, and twinkies.
          
          The CLERK eyes him suspiciously.
          
          
          EXT STREET - SAME
          
          Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees
          ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees
          a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.
          
                                                                  90.

                     Jesus Christ people! Get a room!
          
          They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see Tom is wide awake. He
          probably hasn't slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to
          the alarm.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - LATER
          
          Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the
          clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't
          muster responses. At his desk,
          
                                 MCKENZIE
                     Tom!
          
          Nothing.
          
                               MCKENZIE
                     I've been calling every five
                     minutes. Are you ok?
          
                               TOM
                     What? Oh yeah. Great.
          
                               MCKENZIE
                     Do you need anything?
          
                                 TOM

          INT BOARDROOM - LATER
          
          Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his
          usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.
          
          A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in
          mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do
          with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up
          for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    This one says "Go for it!"
          
          She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    This one says "Don't give up!"
          
          Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    And this one says "You can do it!"
                    We have a whole line of
                    inspirational cards featuring
                    Pickles, my cat. I think people
                    will really enjoy them. Thank you.

                    Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really
                    inspirational stuff. Now, who's

                    This isn't inspirational. It's
                    suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm
                    writing a sympathy card for that
                    cat. That's the last thing I want
                    to be doing with my life. It's bad

                    That's cause we're liars! It's what
                    we do here. Why don't we level with
                    people? Stop feeding them nonsense?

                              TOM
                    Yes but think about it! Why do
                    people buy these things? Not to say
                    how they feel. There's paper and
                    pens for that. People give these
                    cards when they can't say how they
                    feel. Or they're afraid to. And we
                    provide the service that lets `em
                    get away with that!
          
          Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing
          uncomfortable.
          
                              TOM
                    I say to hell with it! Let's level
                    with America. Or at least make them
                    speak for themselves! I mean,
                    seriously, what's this...
                        (picks a card off the

                    "I'm sorry to hear your grandmother
                    has passed." What the hell? Let's
                    give em some truth. Something like,
                    "Sorry to hear about your
                    grandmother. Here's a card so I get
                    some credit in your time of need.
                    I'm sure it makes up for the fact
                    that grandma's dead."
          
          Vance and the card-writing team are appalled.

                    I think we do a bad thing here.
                    People should be able to say how
                    they feel, how they really feel,
                    without some strangers putting
                    words in their mouths. The truth. A
                    card is a nice thought but it
                    shouldn't do the dirty work for
                    you. You love someone, tell them
                    yourself, in your own words. Maybe
                    it's not love at all. Maybe there's
                    no such thing as love. Maybe
                    it's... "galoogoo."

                              TOM
                    It's all crap. We make and peddle
                    crap. And sometimes people believe
                    in this crap. I just can't do it
                    anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough
                    bullshit in the world without my
                    help. I quit.
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          
          And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty
          stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It
          doesn't really take.

                    How do you know?

                    We know.

                    But... It's May! We broke up last

                    And you said she was single at

                    Yeah.

                    Now she's getting married.

                    I'm so sorry Tom.

                    Married?

                    It's insane.
          
                              TOM
                    It's impossible. It doesn't make
                    sense. Where did they meet? Is it
                    someone we know?
          
                                 PAUL

                              TOM
                    So everything she said. All that
                    stuff about... it can't be. Not
                    her. I know her too well. She
                    wouldn't do that.

          Lord knows I like bosoms. It's

                    Hmm?
          
                               RACHEL
                    I know you think she was the
                    perfect girl for you...
                        (BEAT)
                    I don't. I think you're just
                    remembering the good stuff. But
                    what do I know, right? I'm 13.
          
                                                                    102.
          
          
          
          She blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls.
          Tom watches her go.

          SPLITSCREEN - TOM'S BEDROOM/ SUMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Tom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting
          his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear.
          
                                TOM
                    Hey.
          
          Summer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her
          side and she angles towards it.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Hello?
          
                              TOM
                    Are you still sleeping?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (GROGGY)
                    I'm getting up. What time is it?
          
                              TOM
                    10:30. Are we still hanging out
                    today?
          
                                SUMMER
                    Ok. Sure.
          
                              TOM
                    I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20
                    minutes?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I might need 45.
          
          
          EXT PARK - DAY
          
          Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar,
          it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful
          day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it
          all, finally, fell apart.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    So how was last night?
          
                              SUMMER
                    It was fine. Just a work thing.
          
                              TOM
                    Where did you guys go?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Some restaurant.
          
                              TOM
                    Fun?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Uneventful. Didn't get home until
                    after 12 though which is way too
                    late for a stupid work function.
                    How was your night?
          
                              TOM
                    Pretty standard.
          
          Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of
          silence.
          
          
          EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER
          
          Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were
          looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we
          might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the
          aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's
          distant. But only if we're really looking.
          
          
          (406)
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment
          again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.
          
          LATER. He hangs some new pictures.
          
          LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.
          Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He
          draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
          something.
          
                                                                   104.
          
          
          
          
          (240)
          INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER
          
          That day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper.
          Summer reads a novel.
          
                              TOM
                    It's playing at 5.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You want to go?
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know. You wanna maybe go
                    back to your place or ---
          
                              SUMMER
                    I want to see it. Let's go.
          
                               TOM
                    Ok cool.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Unless you don't want to.
          
                              TOM
                    No, I will. That's fine.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          A few more silent beats. Something's in the air.
          
          
          INT MOVIE - LATER
          
          Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in
          Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to
          look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to
          be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.
          
          
          (409)
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.
          
                                                                 105.
          
          
          
          And then he stops.
          
          He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit.
          He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.
          From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
          form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
          almost shaped like a tear drop.
          
          
          (240)
          EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
          
          Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's
          alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
          that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.
          
                                 TOM
                       Hey.
          
          He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs
          back.
          
                                 TOM
                       Hey Sum, it's just a movie.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       I know. I'm sorry Tom.
          
                                 TOM
                       Is everything alright with you?
          
          She smiles, tries to pull herself together.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm
                       being ridiculous.
          
                                 TOM
                       It's ok. This happens to me every
                       time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go
                       for a walk, ok. Let's get some air.
                       Or go to Sister Ray's.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Ok.
          
          They walk.
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          
          
          INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT
          
          Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles.
          He grabs one.
          
                               TOM
                    It pains me that we live in a world
                    where no one's ever heard of
                    Spearmint.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I've never heard of them.
          
                              TOM
                    And it's painful. Oh look.
          
          He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as
          we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down
          the aisles.
          
          In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.
          It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand
          approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it
          at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if
          there's something to read in that.
          
          
          (411)
          EXT HARBOR - DAY
          
          Tom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the
          works. He's in the zone.
          
          
          (240)
          EXT RECORD STORE - LATER
          
          Again, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.
          
                              SUMMER
                    So.
          
                              TOM
                    So... Now what?
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    Now...I think I'm gonna call it a
                    day.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some
                    dinner or something?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I've got pasta at home.
          
                              TOM
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm pretty hungry, but --
          
                                TOM
                    Ooh!
          
                                SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    I've got a great idea!
          
                                SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    Let's get breakfast.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Now?
          
                                TOM
                    Pancakes?
          
          Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is
          history.

          Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          
          LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we
          first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while
          holding a phone with the other.
          
          
          2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
          
          Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the

          2. INT LIBRARY - DAY
          
          Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
          reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
          design.
          
          
          3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
          
          Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
          lobby of a high-rise.
          
          
          4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY
          
          Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing
          soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.
          
          
          6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
          his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
          futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
          Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also
          crossed off.
          
          
          5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY

          Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
          crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
          sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
          in thought.
          
                                                                    109.
          
          
          Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
          he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.
          
          
          9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY
          
          On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.
          Thinking.
          
          On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
          lifted. And she's a bride.
          
          END MUSIC.
          
          
          (478)
          EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
          
          Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
          interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
          the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
          Summer ages ago.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
          in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
          
                                 SUMMER (V.O.)
                       Hey.
          
          Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
          may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
          Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
          do.
          
                                 SUMMER
                           (re: suit)
                       Where you coming from?
          
                                 TOM
                       What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have
                       you been sitting there?
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Awhile.
          
          Tom finds it hard to look at her.
          
                                                                   110.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    I come here a lot. I always loved
                    this place, ever since you brought
                    me here.
          
          The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
          
                              TOM
                    So... I should probably say
                    congratulations.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Probably. But only if you mean it.
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know if I do honestly.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I understand.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're
                    happy.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You really do?
          
                                 TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    God no.
          
          They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
          
                              SUMMER
                    How are you, Tom?
          
                              TOM
                    I'm good. Ish.
          
                              SUMMER
                    That's good.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah I quit the office.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Really? That's great! What are you
                    doing now?
          
                              TOM
                    Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
          
          Awkward silence.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    So who's the guy?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Who, my guy?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I
                    don't want to know.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom...
          
                              TOM
                    No really, I don't.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And
          THEN:
          
                              TOM
                    It's amazing to me. You're married.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I know.
          
                              TOM
                    You're not only someone's
                    girlfriend, your someone's wife!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Pretty crazy, huh?
          
                              TOM
                        (SIGHS)
                    I'll never understand that.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom --
          
                              TOM
                    What's different now? How could
                    things change so quickly?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I don't know. It just happened.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened?! That's what I don't
                    get.
          
                                                                 112.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    I... Tom...
          
                              TOM
                    What, tell me...
          
                              SUMMER
                    I woke up one day and I knew.
          
          Tom says nothing.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I knew I could promise him I'd feel
                    the same way every morning. In a
                    way that I... I never could with
                    you.
          
          And there's not much else to say after that.
          
          Tom gets up to leave.
          
                              TOM
                    You know what sucks? Realizing that
                    everything you believe in is
                    complete bullshit.
          
                               SUMMER
                    What is?
          
                              TOM
                    Destiny, soulmates, true love. All
                    that stuff. It's nothing more than
                    silly childhood fairy tale
                    nonsense, isn't it? God!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom, don't go.
          
                              TOM
                    I should have listened to you,
                    Summer. You were right all along.
          
          Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I was right?
          
          And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
          
                              TOM
                    What? This is funny?
          
                                                                  113.
          
          
          
          Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's
          completely cracking up.
          
                              TOM
                    What are you laughing at?
          
          And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
          
                              TOM
                        (trying himself not to
                         LAUGH)
                    You're a crazy person!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom! You're the crazy person!
          
                              TOM
                    What are you talking about?!
          
                              SUMMER
                    One day I'm reading a book at the
                    corner deli and this guy sits down
                    and starts asking about it. Now
                    he's my husband!
          
                              TOM
                    This is funny to you?
          
                               SUMMER
                    What would have happened if I went
                    to the movies instead? If I went
                    somewhere else for lunch? If I
                    showed up to eat ten minutes later?
                    Tom, it was meant to be, just like
                    you said. And as it was happening,
                    I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
                    the sun. And I kept thinking to
                    myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
                    You were right about all of it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It just wasn't me you were right
                    about.
          
          Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
          wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
          shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
          few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Anyway, I should probably be
                    getting back. It was good to see
                    you. I'm glad you're well.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
          
          Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a
          SECOND:
          
                                 TOM
                       Summer!
          
          She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely
          for the last time ever.
          
                                 TOM
                       I really do hope you're happy.
          
                                  SUMMER
                       I know.
                           (BEAT)
                       See you later.
          
          And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving
          Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
          second.
          
                                                          FADE OUT:
          
          
          A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          (500)
          INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY
          
          Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
          at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
          Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
          time.
          
          Tom waits.
          
          We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
          another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
          
                                 GIRL
                       Are you here to interview?
          
                                 TOM
                       Sorry?
          
                                                                 115.
          
          
          
                              GIRL
                    Are you interviewing? For the
                    position?
          
                              TOM
                    Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?
          
                                 GIRL
                    Yup.
          
                              TOM
                    Ah. My competition.
          
                              GIRL
                    It would appear.
          
                              TOM
                    Gee, this is a little awkward.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Yes it is.
          
                              TOM
                    Well, I hope you don't get it.
          
                              GIRL
                    I hope you don't get it.
          They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
          during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
          can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
          girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.
          And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
          
                                 TOM
                    So, uh...
          
                                 GIRL
                    Hmm?
          
                              TOM
                    Are you from...California?
          
                              GIRL
                    Grew up not too far from here.
                    Atherton, near Stanford.
          
                              TOM
                    I know Atherton. Nice area.
          
                              GIRL
                    Have I seen you before?
          
                                                                 116.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    I, uh, don't know. I don't think
                    so.
          
                              GIRL
                    Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to
                    pray or anything but to stand
                    outside?
          
                              TOM
                    I do! I love that church. It's like
                    my favorite structure in the city.
          
                              GIRL
                    If only it wasn't near that
                    horrible mirrored thing...
          
                              TOM
                    Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
          
                               GIRL
                    Yeah.
                        (BEAT)
                    I think I've seen you there.
          
                              TOM
                    You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see
                    you.
          
                              GIRL
                    It happens. You probably weren't
                    looking.
          
          A MAN comes out.
          
                              MAN
                    Tom Hansen?
          
                                 TOM
                    Yes.
          
                              MAN
                    Come on back.
          
                                 TOM
                    Thank you.
          
          He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
          and looks back at the girl.
          
                                                                 117.
          
          
          
                              NARRATOR
                    If Tom had learned anything... it
                    was that you can't ascribe great
                    cosmic significance to a simple
                    earthly event. Coincidence. That's
                    all anything ever is. Nothing more
                    than coincidence.
          
          ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
          Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
          
                               NARRATOR
                    It took a long time but Tom had
                    finally learned. There are no
                    miracles. There's no such thing as
                    fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
                    knew. He was sure of it now.
                        (BEAT)
                    Tom was...
          
          Tom turns back around.
          
                              NARRATOR
                    ...pretty sure.
          
                               TOM
                        (to Girl)
                    Excuse me.
          
                              GIRL
                    Hello stranger.
          
                              TOM
                    When this is over... uh... would
                    you like to maybe...grab a cup of
                    coffee or something?
          
                              GIRL
                    Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet
                    someone.
          
                              TOM
                        (DEFLATED)
                    Oh. Got it... No problem.
          
          He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
          the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.
          
                              GIRL
                    Ok.
          
          Tom turns back around.
          
                                                                118.
          
          
          
                               TOM
                     What's that?
          
                                GIRL
                     Why not?
          
                                TOM
                     Yeah?
          
                                GIRL
                     Yeah.
          
                               TOM
                     Great! So... I'll wait for you
                     here, or you wait for me
                     or...something.
          
          She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.
          
                               GIRL
                     We'll figure it out.
          
                                TOM
                     Ok!
                         (extends hand to shake)
                     My name's Tom.
          
                               GIRL
                     Nice to meet you...
          
          She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.
          
                               GIRL
                     I'm Autumn.
          
          And on his face...

          BLACK SCREEN

          The sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside,
          and hearing the crowd through a window or door. FADE IN ON:

          INT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY

          DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down,
          thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and
          confident. Content. Completely in his element.
          In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of
          individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the
          muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:

          VOICE ON PA SYSTEM
          Thank you so much for coming today--
          A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.

                         BLUE BLAZER
          Congressman Norris-?
          Now REVEAL that we're Â±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building
          at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad
          out front. "Norris for Senate" placards everywhere.

                         BLUE-BLAZER
          Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've
          never seen a crowd this big turn
          out so early in the cycle.
          CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--.

                         CHARLIE
          Just wait 'till you see how they
          respond to him..
          David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens
          his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.

                         DAVID
          Don't build me up like that,
          Charlie. He'll be disappointed.

          EXT. ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY -- MAIN QUAD -- DAY

          The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with
          approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of
          the Admin Building.

                         DAVID
          Hi there. I'm David Norris. And
          I'm running for the US Senate.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 2.
          The crowd goes wild.

          MONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN
          --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
          The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
          ovation.
          --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison
          plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most
          politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
          --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
          with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
          --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
          redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
          --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
          David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
          today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
          follow him. Especially young people.
          --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
          as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
          camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
          mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
          --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
          tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
          into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie
          stands nearby watching him speak:.

          INT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK

          David enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly
          with the noisy energy of the campaign trail.
          He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a
          moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him.
          He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his
          itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and
          meetings across the state.
          He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the
          page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech
          he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open
          Space Initiative.

                         DAVID

          Bob.

          Ricky, Little League. John Pascal.
          Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two
          year old: Loyita...
          He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a
          Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days
          out.

                         DAVID

          Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart
          Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan
          Sabovic, Jim Vargas...
          His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning.
          He doesn't need to review. It's already all there.
          He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks
          out at the trees.
          The silence back...it's deafening.

          INT. SHERATON LOBBY -- UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

          Charlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David,
          holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him
          as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's
          clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him
          aside.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell? What happened to
          "I'm going to have softie tea, rest
          my voice, and go to bed early?"
          You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and
          you have to be up at four AM for us
          to make it in time.
          David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand
          he picks up a cup and saucer.

                         DAVID
          I had some tea.
          (sees Charlie's not in the

                         MOOD)
          Come on, man. We're eight points
          up in the polls. I've gotta cut
          loose every once in a while and
          have a life.
          This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen
          strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like
          having a life to him...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 4.

                         CHARLIE
          Ten.

                         DAVID
          What?

                         CHARLIE
          Latest poll has you ten points up.
          A slow smile spreads across David's face.

                         CUT TO:

                         BLACK SCREEN
          The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder:

          CAMPAIGN AIDE.
           County reporting: 8901 for
          Lynfield, 7233 for Norris.

          INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT

          Charlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that.
          She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county.

                         CHARLIE

                         (NATURAL OPTIMIST)
          Better than I thought, I thought
          we'd get killed in Seneca.
          He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen
          Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops.

                         CHARLIE
          Eddie, call Boyd! Where the hell
          are the. Suffolk numbers? We've got
          to get the Suffolk numbers!

          EXT. ROOFTOP NEAR WALDORF -- NIGHT

          A light snow falls. Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS,
          overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story
          building. Their clothing is more timeless than old-
          fashioned. And somehow so is their demeanor.
          The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost-
          as if it's their domain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 5.

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

          David watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are
          discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already
          called for David's opponent.

                         PUNDIT #1
          Congressman Norris has a reputation
          for being very direct, even blunt,
          in his campaign speeches, which is
          great until you say too many things
          you wish you hadn't. Then you
          start to look like an amateur.

                         PUNDIT #2
          That's bad for any candidate but
          it's fatal if you're running for
          Senate at the age of 33, your
          opponent keeps calling you an
          "impulsive kid," and you almost
          killed your entire political career
          five months ago with an act of
          immaturity that ended up on the
          front page of`.the New York Post.
          David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then
          Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through
          the open door behind him.

                         -CHARLIE
          Why are you still watching CNN?
          They called this way too early.
          David doesn't share his friend's optimism.

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE'-- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT

          A' campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room:

                         AIDE
          Suffolk County Numbers!
          Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen.

           AIDE (O.S.)
          Lynfield: 415,120. Norris:

          370,233.
          Charlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly.

                         CHARLIE
          (after long beat)
          I really thought we'd win Suffolk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 6.
          A senior aide walks over.

                         SENIOR AIDE
          Kings County just came in too.

                         A BRUTAL
          He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David.
          beat...

                         DAVID
          Well, it's over. And it's going to
          be a blowout...
          David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment
          that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going
          to lose big. It's going to be a grand,. public humiliation.

                         SENIOR AIDE
          NBC has us up next.
          Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC.

                         BRIAN WILLIAMS
          Turning now to the New York Senate
          race, NBC is now calling the
          election for Roger'Lynfield. After
          a shockingly poor showing in both
          Suffolk county and in his home
          county, Kings, it now appears that
          David Norris will lose this
          election badly, perhaps by as much
          as 10 points.

          EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          The four men in dark suits.. The boss's name is RICHARDSON,
          early 40s. His top aide is.AHARRY, 50s.

                         RICHARDSON
          This is a.bignight, gentleman.

                         (TOHARRY)
          Is ever ything set?
          Harry nods. Richardson notices his eyes:

                         RICHARDSON
          You look tired. You should take a
          vacation when we finish with this.
          You'll have earned it.

                         HARRY
          I'm not sure the kind of tired I
          feel would be fixed by a vacation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 7.

                         RICHARDSON
          Sure it would. Everybody needs a
          vacation. Even us.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE -- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT

          The staff and supporters in here have become very quiet.
          Their candidate is standing in the middle of the room, but no
          one can look at him. And David can't look at them either...

                         DAVID

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          I'm going to take a walk, figure
          out my speech.

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          Four-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big
          screens in the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom. No one says a word.
          The mood has gone from.hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds.

          INT. WALDORF LOBBY -- NIGHT

          David slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the
          staff. But when he.gets to the door he sees that press vans
          line the front of the hotel. There will be no peace for him
          if he steps out there. He turns around.

                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
          Good evening, Congressman. You're
          in the Grand Ballroom if that's
          what you're looking for.

                         DAVID
          Actually just looking for a place
          to be alone for a minute before I
          head in there.

                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
          None of the banquet rooms on the
          third floor are in use tonight.

                         DAVID
          Thank you.

          INT. EMPTY BANQUET ROOM -- NIGHT

          David stands alone looking out at the empty room. Trying to
          get used to it. It's not easy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 8.

          INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row
          of sinks. He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his
          pocket. He twirls them in his hands for a moment.
          Then tosses them into the trash can. He looks at himself in
          the mirror, fighting to hold himself together.
          A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one
          of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an
          expensive bottle of champagne.

                         WOMAN
          Hi. I hope I didn't startle you.

                         DAVID
          What are you doing in here?

                         WOMAN
          Hiding from security.

                         DAVID
          Oh... . What did you do?

                         WOMAN
          Crashed a wedding. One floor up.

                         DAVID
          It's almost midnight. They'just
          caught on now?

                         WOMAN
          Ivana Trump finally realized I
          wasn't her niece. I think after
          the fifth; glass of champagne my
          Czech accent started slipping.
          spite of David's state that gets a grin.

                         DAVID
          Are you for real?

                         WOMAN
          Life is short.

                         DAVID
          Hard to argue with that.

                         WOMAN
          You're that guy running for Senate
          aren't you?

                         DAVID
          I'm "that guy."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 9.

                         WOMAN
          You winning?

                         DAVID
          No.

                         WOMAN
          Too bad. The other guy's a tool.

                         DAVID

                         (LAUGHS)
          Maybe I should have made that
          clearer in my ads.

                         WOMAN
          Personally, I think mooning your
          friends at a college reunion is no
          big deal.

                         (BEAT)
          And I don't think the Post should
          have printed the photo.
          David just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that
          down and he knows it.

                         WOMAN
          At least not full page.
          He can't help but crack up.

                         WOMAN
          Listen, I've done it.

                         DAVID
          You weren't running, for Senate at
          the time.

                         WOMAN
          Do you still have a chance or is it
          over?

                         DAVID
          He crushed me.
          She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for
          conveying empathy...

                         WOMAN
          You must ...I don't know what you
          must be feeling...

                         DAVID
          Winning would feel better. But
          losing has its advantages.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 10.

                         WOMAN
          Like what?

                         DAVID
          The only time a politician is alone
          is when he's asleep.. .or in the
          bathroom. After eight years in
          politics that gets kind of hard to
          take.
          She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.

                         WOMAN
          Watching you, you'd never know it.
          The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows
          she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even
          quite sure what it is. Not yet.

                         DAVID
          Thank you...

                         WOMAN
          Well, everything happens for a
          reason, right? Even losing. God,
          I'm really rollrng out the
          platitudes tonight, aren't I?

                         DAVID
          It's the champagne. Brines out the
          Hallmark in people.

                         WOMAN
          After it kills their Czech accents.
          She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it.

                         DAVID
          Why not? I have to think up some
          good platitudes for my speech.
          He takes a gulp of champagne.

                         WOMAN
          Why the hell would you do that?

                         DAVID
          Apparently, even if I hadn't been
          caught dropping my drawers in the
          middle of a senate campaign I would
          have lost the election anyway
          because I'm too blunt.

                         WOMAN
          (swig of champagne)
          Says who?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 11.

                         DAVID
          The TV pundits.

                         WOMAN
          Fuck 'em. They just wish they had
          the balls to be candidates
          themselves.
          She hands him the champagne bottle again.

                         WOMAN
          And they work for the Man anyway.

                         (BEAT)
          You going to run again?

                         DAVID

                         (DRINKS)
          Tonight's probably not the night to
          ask.

                         WOMAN

                         (FINGER POINTING)
          No, it is. Look at me. You have
          to run again. Do-yo hear me?
          She's serious about this. Intense.

                         WOMAN
          Otherwise the-country will be run
          by tools. like Lynwood.

                         DAVID
          "Field."
          (of f her look)
          "Lynfield."
          A beat. She shrugs.
          Then they lean toward each other... and kiss. It turns more
          and more passionate. When they finally pull apart:

                         DAVID
          Holy shit.
          She seems just as surprised. They look at each other and
          laugh.
          Just then the bathroom door opens. It's Charlie. He sees
          David and the woman.

                         CHARLIE
          David?

                         WOMAN

                         (SUDDENLY EMBARRASSED)
          I better go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 12.
          She exits.

                         DAVID

                         WAIT--

          INT. 3RD FLOOR BALLROOM AREA

          The woman comes out of the bathroom. David is right behind
          her. Then Charlie.

                         DAVID
          Wait.
          The woman turns to face David. Suddenly two hotel guards
          turn the corner and spot the woman.

                         HOTEL SECURITY
          There!
          They rush toward her.

                         WOMAN
          Gotta go.
          (to David, emphatically.)
          Don't let the bastards grind you
          down.
          She spins and sprints away. The hotel guards chase her.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell was that?

                         DAVID
          I'm really not sure.
          David has a huge grin on his face.

                         DAVID
          But I think I'm ready to give my
          speech.

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          David as he walks out from behind a curtain onto the dais.
          His supporters start clapping... . but clearly they're
          heartbroken. David looks completely peaceful.

                         DAVID
          I grew up in Red Hook and I don't
          want to shock anybody but I got in
          a few fist fights along the way.
          Laughter ripples through the crowd. We don't know enough yet
          to get the joke.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 13.

                         DAVID
          And we used to have a saying when
          you got in a fight: "it's not
          whether or not you get knocked down
          -- because eventually everyone does
          -- it's what you do when you get
          back up."

                         (BEAT)
          Don't worry, I'm not going to moon
          you.
          The audience explodes with laughter this time.

                         DAVID
          But I am...
          (waiting for the laughter
          to die down)
          But I am going to get backup. I
          wanted to come out here tonight and
          give you a victory speech, a speech
          I've dreamed of giving foremost of
          my life. But life doesn't always
          deal you the cards you want.
          The audience sobered now. Reflective.

                         DAVID
          My life changed when I was ten
          years old. My entire world turned
          upside-down.'
          His audience,. knows exactly what he's talking about.

                         DAVID
          And as I looked for something to
          -hang ;on to, something; to help me
          cope' with what had. happened the
          only thing that made sense to me
          was service. Finding a way to do
          something with my life that left
          this world a little better than I
          found it.
          The audience is moved. Tears begin to well up. People dab
          at their eyes.

          The sky is just beginning to turn from black to deep blue.
          The park is still and silent.
          A black Mercedes pulls up on Madison Ave. Mr. Richardson,
          again in a dark suit, gets out and enters the park.

          and 7:05 am.
          Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.

                         RICHARD SON
          You planned that vacation, right?

                         HARRY
          Two weeks.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          As David walks down the aisle a couple of passengers
          recognize his face. . .but they don't say anything.
          David nears an empty aisle seat. A woman is curled up in the
          window seat, sleeping. She wears a funky mini-dress, knee-
          high argyle socks under leather boots, and a (clashing)
          argyle bucket cap.
          David sits next to her. And stares.

                         DAVID
          No way...
          It's the woman from election night.', He leans around to try
          to see the front of her face. "It's definitely her. His
          eyes drift down at her legs. Just then she opens her eyes.
          She recoils for a second;. Then` her eyes soften when she
          realizes who it is.

                         DAVID

                         (MOMENTARLY SELF-

                         CONSCIOUS)

          You need a better line than that or
          I'll have to assume you're a
          pervert who likes to stare at
          girls' legs while-, they sleep.

                         DAVID
          (smiles, game on)
          Your skirt was so short I couldn't
          help it.

          that matters is they both show leg.

                         DAVID
          So do shorts, dear.

                         WOMAN
          Yeah, but there's that pesky piece
          of fabric right here that
          interferes with your fantasy life.
          She shuts her eyes and leans against the window.

                         WOMAN
          Wake me when you have a good come
          back to that.

                         DAVID
          I have one but, unlike you, I
          wouldn't say it in public.

                         WOMAN
          (eyes still closed)
          Pussy.
          David laughs. Can not believe this woman. In a good way.
          His blackberry RINGS. Her eyes pop open. David.picks up.

          Hello...? Hello?
          David looks at his. phone. The signal has gone to zero.

                         DAVID

                         (TO WOMAN)
          The line cut.

                         WOMAN
          That ringer get any-louder or do
          you pretty much have it maxed out?

                         DAVID

                         WOMAN
          I never sleep through the night. I
          catch up on the bus.

                         (SERIOUS NOW)
          I saw your concession speech. I
          heard Bill Clinton called it the
          best political speech he's seen in
          20 years.
          David looks back at her.

          Something got into me.
          He means her. They stare at each other.

                         DAVID
          What's the deal with you and
          argyles?

                         WOMAN
          What's the deal with you and boring
          shades of blue?
          David is wearing a Navy blue suit, blue shirt, and blue tie.
          A beat.

                         DAVID

                         WOMAN
          That's easy if you. restrict
          yourself to one color.

                         DAVID

          His blackberry goes again. RING-RING.

                         DAVID
          Hello? Hello?
          He shakes his head. It's dead again.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH STREET -- MORNING

          thinks of your voting record.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH STREET -- MORNING

          Harry spots the bus passing on Park. He jams his fedora on
          his head and stretches his arm out--

                         HARRY
          Now.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David's phone rings again. As he reaches for the phone he
          fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of
          coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress.

                         DAVID
          Oh, Jesus...

                         (FIGHTING LAUGHTER)
          I'm sorry.

          Harry's face.

                         HARRY
          Shit!
          He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse
          inside: a complicated circuit diagram. Harry shuts the
          book, look's up to get a bead on" the the bus, then takes off down
          Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square.

          INT.'BUS -- MORNING


                         DAVID

          He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs.

                         WOMAN
          Hope your new job pays better than
          your old one.

                         DAVID

                         WOMAN
          God, that is smooth. Spill coffee
          on me then ask for my number.
          She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip,
          then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes.

                         WOMAN
          Just let me spill some on you and
          we'll be even.
          She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries.

                         DAVID
          It's my first day at the office!

                         WOMAN

          She thrusts the cup back at him-

                         DAVID
          No!
          He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers.

                         (ACTUALLY PLEADING)

          They struggle with the cup. <,;:Both suppressing laughter.

                         DAVID
          You're crazy. Actually crazy.
          The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with
          her free hand.

                         WOMAN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          He's not here!
          She hangs up.

                         DAVID
          Who was that?
          She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she
          holds it on the other side of her body.

                         DAVID
          What is this, third grade?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 22.

                         WOMAN
          You forgot what that was like,
          didn't you? How fun it was...
          That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again.

                         WOMAN
          Oh my God! How do you stand it?
          She drops the phone into the coffee.

                         WOMAN
          There. We're even.
          He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows
          what would come next if they were in private...
          The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat.

                         WOMAN
          Sturdy little fucker, isn't it?
          She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her
          scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail.
          Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake.

                         WOMAN
          By the way, I'm Elise.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- DAY

          Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching
          her. She turns back to look at him.

                         DAVID
          The morning after .I lost I woke up
          thinking about you .
          That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          Moments later. Through the window, David watches Elise
           walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him
           a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips
          a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING

          Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 23.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper.
          He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes
          the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life--

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING

          Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his
          Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus--

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the
          cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all
          over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING


                         HARRY
          Dammit!
          Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus--
          HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him.
          TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood--

          INT. RSR CAPITAL -- CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          A big corner office. The phone rings. Charlie picks up.

          DAVID (TEL. V.O.)
          Guess who I just sat down next to
          on the bus?

          INTERCUTTING WITH CHARLIE

                         CHARLIE
          Who?

                         DAVID
          The woman from election night.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING

          A dazed Harry lies in the road... The taxi driver who hit
          him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 24.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING


           CHARLIE (TEL. V.O.)
          The one you kissed?

                         DAVID
          She kissed me. I just didn't
          fight it.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING

          Harry sits up... He's bruised but okay. He looks around for
          something. Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front
          tire.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING


           CHARLIE (O.S.)
          You're shitting me. Just randomly
          you sit down next to--
          He's cut off mid-word.

                         DAVID
          Charlie?
          David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David
          hits redial. Gets a fast busy.

                         DAVID
          ' (to himself).
          This is ridiculous.
          He pockets his phone.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH MORNING

          The taxi driver is with Harry now.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          Are you okay?
          Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently
          for something.

                         HARRY
          I'm fine-- Will you hand me that?
           Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few
          feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 25.

          TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D)
          Are you sure you're okay?
          The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
          page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
          Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
          symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
          language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
          And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
          lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.

                         HARRY
          Oh...shit...

          EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING

          David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office
          tower. He enters through the revolving door--

          INT. DAVID'S OFFICE BUILDING'-- GROUND FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING

          Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other
          end of the lobby. David gets into an empty elevator.

          INT. 41ST FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING

          David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone. He
          waves as-he:passes by. No wade back. She must not see him.

                         DAVID
          Okay...
          Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.

          INT. RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- MORNING

           David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul
          in sight. Not a single secretary is here.

                         DAVID
          (loud, playful)
          Doesn't anybody bother getting in
          before eight at this place?
          David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a
          large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office
          marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 26.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)

                         (EXUBERANT)
          Susan! How are you today?
          (when she doesn't move)
          Susan?
          David looks closer across her desk. Her face is frozen.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          Susan?
          He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead
          still. David rushes through Charlie's door:

                         DAVID
          Call 911! Something's wrong with
          Susan!

          INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          --and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with
          the phone up to his ear. Like he's in a wax museum.
          He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver
          protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).
          One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached
          to the left side.of Charlie's skull.

                         DAVID
          Jesus!
          Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see
          David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the
          "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night.

          DAVID (,.CONT'D)
          What the hell are you doing?!
          Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:

                         RICHARDSON
          Grab him!
          David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--

          INT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING

          David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he
          gets there. He grabs it. It's locked.
          He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges
          from a door in the middle of the hallway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 27.
          David jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that
          Richardson could have gotten there that fast.

                         RICHARDSON
          You can't get away, David.
          David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down
          an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last
          five steps and hits the floor hard.
          As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is
          frozen solid.
          David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find
          Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall.
          Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast--
          David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a
          chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT...
          FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of
          the large corner offices on the 40th floor.
          The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid."
          Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,

                         INSIDE --
           Except when they walk through the door they're not in an
          office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a
          large warehouse...
          Their movement completely violates the laws of physics.

                         BLACK SCREEN
          Silence. Then voices come up slowly:

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I
          understand that, sir. Absolutely.
          I'll do that, sir.

                         (BEAT)
          What a goddamm mess.

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          Was that Donaldson?

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Yes.

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          What do you want to do?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 28.
           FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse
          David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out.
          A half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver
          Suits) stand nearby. Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men
          from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away.

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Can you reset him?

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          I don't think we have the authority
          in a situation like this.

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)

                         CALL LEGAL-

          BURDENSKY (0.S.).
          Legal just arrived.

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          REVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit,
          carrying a briefcase. He.walks to Richardson.

                         BURDENSKY
          Re-setting's off the table. This
          is our fault:...
          Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself
          off to the side, clearly disgraced.
          David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson,
          cranes around to see who's talking.

                         DAVID
          Hey.
          The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to
          talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume.

                         RICHARDSON
          What are my options?

                         BURDENSKY

                         (IGNORING DAVID)
          You could bullshit him but you'll
          never be completely successful.

                         DAVID
          Can somebody tell me what's going
          on?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 29.

                         BURDENSKY
          (still ignoring him)
          The questions will burn in him till
          the day he dies. You'll have to
          monitor him constantly...

                         ON DAVID
          He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying--

          BURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE)
          .to make sure he doesn't talk...
          the endless ripple effects...
          REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him.

          ON THE SUITS

                         BURDENSKY
          If it were me, I'd level with him.

                         RIC:HARDSON
          Completely?

                         BURDENSKY
          That's the only way to extinguish
          his curiosity.
          Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him.
          An uncomfortable pause.

                         DAVID
          Who are you guys?

                         RICHARDSON
          We're the people v ho make sure
          things happen according to Plan.
          David stares back at him for a moment.
          then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He
          sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse.
          Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--

          CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR
          It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as
          David's foot comes down on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 30.

          BACK TO WIDE SHOT
          David trips and goes flying--

                         MOMENTS LATER
          David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed
          back in his chair in front of Richardson.

                         RICHARDSON
          Did you really think I couldn't see
          that coming?
          David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          I can read your mind!
          David stares back.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          Yeah, really...

                         (BEAT)
          Choose a color.
          (barely a beat)
          Blue. Choose a number.
          (even less time)
          Seventeen.
          David's jaw drops slightly. Richardson was clearly right.

                         RICHARDSON
          Now,. why are you still deciding
          whether or not to run?
          David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic
          response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from
          spilling out into view.

                         RICHARDSON
          You saw the futility of that back
          at the office.
          David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
          point. He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all
          this based in the world he's known to date...

                         DAVID
          What the hell is happening to me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 31.

                         RICHARDSON
          You just saw behind a curtain you
          weren't even supposed to know was
          there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring.
          I'm sure.

                         DAVID
          I just... came to work...

                         RICHARDSON
          It wasn't your fault. Your Path
          through the world this morning was
          supposed to be adjusted.
          (glancing bitterly at
          Harry, in the corner)
          Your coffee was supposed to.spill
          onto your shirt as you left
          Starbucks near your apartment.
          You would have gone up to change
          and arrived at work ten minutes
          later than you did. By then we
          would have left.

                         (BEAT)
          People call it "chance" when their
          coffee spills or their internet
          goes down or they misplace their
          keys. Sometimes it is. Sometimes
          it's:us...nudging you back on Plan.
          David takes all this in. He's still shell-shocked.

                         DAVID
          Whatever you were doing to Charlie
          back there... it wasn't misplacing
          his keys.

                         RICHARDSON
          Sometimes. when nudging a person
          back on Plan isn't enough we
          intervene directly.

                         DAVID
          Why Charlie? What did you do to
          him.

                         RICHARDSON
          You need to worry about getting
          back on your Plan, David, not worry
          about us putting him back on his.
          David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          Only a handful of human beings know
          what you now know, David. We're
          determined to keep it that way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 32.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          So before I let you go, you need to
          understand something: If you ever
          reveal our existence we will erase
          your brain. Your memories, your
          emotions, your entire personality
          will be expunged. Your friends and
          family will think you've gone
          crazy. You won't "think" anything
          because a blank slate can't
          "think."
          Davidstares back.

                         RICHARDSON
          Do you understand what I just said?

                         DAVID
          Yes...

                         RICHARDSON
          Not a word. Not one word about us.
          (long beat as he studies

                         DAVID'S FACE)
          okay ... . you're free to go.
          David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real. Richardson
          points at the door. David walks toward it.
          Just then another man comes up to Richardson.

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          There's awoman.

                         RICHARDSON

                         (SIGHS)
          There's always & Woman...
          Richardson motions;to his men.
          At.-THE DOOR
          Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.

                         DAVID
          He said I could go.

          CENTER OF ROOM

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          You won't believe who she is.
          He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 33.

                         RICHARDSON
          How is that possible? Why didn't
          we get an alert?

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          He wasn't supposed to be on that
          bus. He was supposed to be
          changing his shirt in his
          apartment... It was a controlled
          situation. It was supposed to be.
          The new man looks at Harry.

          AT THE DOOR
          David looks back at Richardson.

                         DAVID
          You said I could go.
          Richardson walks over to him.

          RIC,HARDSON
          You ran into a woman named Elise on
          the bus this morning?

                         DAVID
          (:going very still)
          Why does it'matter?

                         RICHARDSON
          You weren't ever supposed to see
          her again.

                         DAVID
          Why do you care.?

                         RICHARDSON
          Because, David, you can't be with
          her. And we didn't want to have to
          resort to this--
          Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
          prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches
          into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--

                         DAVID
          What the hell-- What are you--
          Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her
          number on from David's wallet--

                         DAVID (CONT'D)

                         NO--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 34.
          Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then
          pulls out a lighter--

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          No!
          And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull
          loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team
          men. But he can't get free.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          What is wrong with you people?!
          Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn.
          ON David's reaction CUT TO:

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
          He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
          walking to the corner to orient himself.
          Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
          the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.

          INT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON

          David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly.

                         BARTENDER
          You're David Norris, right?

                         DAVID
          Ice water.

                         BARTENDER
          That's it?
          David nods. Harry arrives.

                         HARRY
          We should talk. But not here. Go
          back to work and I'll contact you
          later today with a place to meet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 35.

                         DAVID
          Okay.
          Harry can see that David is still very shaken.

                         HARRY
          The world's exactly the same as
          it's always been. You just
          understand it more completely now.

                         (BEAT)
          Hang on to what mattered before you
          knew any of this and you'll be
          fine.

          EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- DAY

          A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward
          downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.

          INT. RSR OFFICES -- DAY

          David enters. Stares at,,hisnew colleagues going about their
          business as if nothing happened.

          INT. 40TH FLOOR --:DAY

          David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve
          Kincaid." He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty
          office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely
          disorienting for him.

          SECRETARY(O.S.)
          Mr. IKincaid's in the finance
          meeting, Congressitan. Main
          conference room.
          David turns to see her.

                         DAVID
          Thanks.
          David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new
          reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner.

                         CHARLIE
          There you are. I called your cell
          ten times. You left me hanging.

                         DAVID
          Sorry...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 36.

                         CHARLIE
          (seeing the look in

                         DAVID'S EYES)
          Are you okay?
          (off David's nod)
          Come on, we're late. Happy first
          day by the way.
          They head towards the conference room.

                         CHARLIE
          You sure you're okay.

                         DAVID
          Fine. How about you?

                         CHARLIE
          Great. Why?

                         DAVID
          No headaches or--

                         CHARLIE
          I feel fantastic, -man. Is it just,
          me or is this an odd conversation?
          (off David" s non-response.)
          What the hell happened with the
          girl?

                         DAVID
          After the meeting.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM RSR CAPITAL DAY

          LONG SHOT from outside the building. The firm's partners sit
          at their weekly investment committee meeting. David watches
          Charlie intently, looking for what's changed...

          INT RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- DAY
          David and Charlie walk back to David's office.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Please explain to me why you don't
          have an ear-to-ear smile right now.

                         THEY ENTER--

          INT. DAVID'S OFFICE -- DAY

          David hesitates. It's like his friend is an alien.. .but then
          again he's totally normal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 37.

                         DAVID
          I lost her number.

                         CHARLIE
          You lost her number?

                         DAVID
          (searching for something)
          I was pickpocketed.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on. You can't be serious.
          (off David's look)
          You're serious... Oh, man...dude.
          I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...

           EXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY

           David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks
           up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them
           warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a
          ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.
          EXT. CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY
          The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so
          there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands
          looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.

                         HARRY
          A lot of people just collapse when
          they see what you've s'een. Their
          personal choices suddenly seem
          meaningless to them. Life starts
          to feel pointless.

                         DAVID
          I was` raised to believe there's
          something behind the curtain. I
          just never pictured it quite like
          this.

                         HARRY
          Most people don't.
          Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his
          colleagues. He's far from relaxed.

                         HARRY
          How are you feeling?

                         DAVID
          You should know. You can read my
          mind, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 38.
          Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David,
          how far to go with this. Finally:

                         HARRY
          Richardson was just trying to scare
          you.

                         DAVID
          He knew what color I was thinking.

                         HARRY
          Because he set it up as a choice.
          "Choose a color. Choose a number"

                         DAVID
          So?
          Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
          himself out there:

                         HARRY
          We can't read your mind or hear
          your thoughts. But before you make
          a choice your brain weighs options,
          and we percpite that. We know if
          you're going to go off Plan "or not
          because, as long as we're close
          enough, we cansense it when it's
          about to happen.

                         DAVID
          it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?

                         HARRY
          Seventh, actually.

                         DAVID
          What did they do too Charlie?

                         HARRY
          Made some small change in the way
          he assesses risk.

                         DAVID
          What type of risk?

                         HARRY
          (this is beside the point)
          I don't know. Something arcane.
          Something to do with mortgage-
          backed securities.

                         DAVID
          That's all?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2/12/09 39

                         HARRY
          Yes.

                         DAVID
          What would your colleagues do to
          you if they knew what you were
          telling me?
          This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.

                         HARRY
          That's why we're meeting out here.

                         DAVID
          They're not following me?

                         HARRY
          We don't have the manpower to
          follow everybody all the time.
          They're checking in on you. Just
          not here. Not right now.
          ON David's face considering this.

          EXT. UPPER DECK DAY

          Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few
          tourists up here.

                         DAVID
          Why are you helping me?

                         HARRY
          I have my reasons.
          David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into

                         THEM:

                         DAVID
          Why do they care if I'm with Elise?

                         HARRY
          Your entire reality gets shattered
          this morning and you want to know
          about a woman?

                         DAVID
          Why do they care?
          Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
          seems to care.

                         HARRY
          I don't know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 40.

                         DAVID
          You have no idea?

                         HARRY
          All I know is, given the amount of
          resources they've used, keeping you
          from her is pretty important to
          them.
          (off David's silence)
          You're going to look for her aren't
          you?
          Again, David is silent.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
          There are twelve million people in
          this city. On a slow day. You're
          not going to find her, you do
          realize that, don't yore-?

                         (BEAT)
          Even if a hypnotist pulled her
          number out of the recesses of your
          brain, no matter how many times you
          called it, you,'d never get
          through...

                         DAVID
          (his face hardening)
          They send you here to tell me that?

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
          You want my advice? Forget about
          her. Accept that you'`>ll never see
          her again. Move on with your life.
          ON David as Harry's words sink in.

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside
          David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's
           already awake, staring at the ceiling...
           After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it
          off. But then just lies there...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 41.

           INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

           It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead
           of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six
          windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to
           his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed.
           No files on the table, like there were the last time we were
          here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.

           CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          How are you feeling about the
          speech?
          David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
          subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:

                         DAVID
          I'm ready... I changed a few
          things last night.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          Tell me at breakfast.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID
          David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is
          a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a
          moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
          park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years
          ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the
          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more
          out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.

          INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING

          David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with
          a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the
          window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
          DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 42.
          David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
          now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same
          eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps
          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.

                         DAVID
          Stop the bus.

                         DRIVER
          The next stop--

                         DAVID
          Now.

          EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING

          The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as
          he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He
          catches up to her at University Place.

                         DAVID
          Elise!
          The woman turns around.
          And it's her...

                         ELISE
          David?

                         DAVID
          Hi.

                         ELISE
          Wow... How areyou.
          Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:

                         DAVID
          (from the heart)
          I rode the Ml to work every day for
          the last three years hoping one day
          I'd run into you again.
          She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.

                         ELISE
          Calling would have been easier.

                         DAVID
          I couldn't.

                         ELISE
          Girlfriend wouldn't let you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 43.

                         DAVID
          No girlfriend.
          She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
          expression is dead serious.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          Can we go somewhere and talk?
          She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
          herself for that, but it's the truth.

                         ELISE
          (re: his suit)
          Don't you have to get to work?

                         DAVID
          I just got sick.

                         ELISE
          "I haven't seen you in three years -
          - You make me sick" is not an
          ideal come-on. For the record.
          David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
          vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.

                         DAVID
          One second.

                         (PICKING UP)
          CharlieT can't make breakfast.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          Why not?

                         DAVID
          And...I might have to push the
          speech.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          What? Are you crazy?!

                         DAVID
          I just ran into Elise.
          He hangs up.

                         ELISE
          You just hung up on your best
          friend.

                         DAVID
          We've known each other since we
          were kids. We have a shorthand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 44.
          He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter-
          of-fact. Serious.

                         ELISE
          What speech?

                         DAVID
          Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk.
          His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting
          reeled in again.

                         ELISE
          Where?

                         DAVID
          Somewhere far. We have a lot to
          talk about.

                         ELISE
          I don't think you should cancel
          your speech. What if I don't like
          you at the end of our walk?

                         DAVID
          I'll take my chances.

                         ELISE
          Seri6us1y, my number hasn't
          changed:. Just call me like you
          didn't last time.

                         DAVID
          My-speech will always be there, you
          might not be.

                         ELISE

                         (AMUSED/INDIGNANT)
          I was there, David. You didn't
          callrie!

                         DAVID
          Walk with me and I'll explain that.
          She's still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns
          it off .

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          (a statement of fact)
          I'm not losing you again. I'm not
          letting you out of my sight.

                         ELISE
          Stalker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 45.

                         DAVID
          Can we walk?
          The moment she finally relents, CUT TO:

                         FOLLOWING SHOT
          Polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly
          shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders.

          INT. ELEGANT OFFICE -- DAY

           Mr. Richardson sits at a large desk. The design is Art Deco
          crossed with Albert Speer. Downtown Manhattan is visible out
          the 30th floor window. Richardson's aide enters.

                         MCCRADY
          We have a problem.

          EXT. GRAMERCY -- DAY

          David and Elise walk north.

                         ELISE
          It's been years, David. How do
          you know I don't have a boyfriend?
          Oh, shit. He hasn't even had time to think about that.

                         DAVID
          you have a boyfriend?

                         EL ;E
          Would it-Matter?

                         DAVID

                         (TRAPPED)
          Uh...yeah...

                         ELISE
          So all the stuff about me being in
          your mind constantly for the last
          three years was just talk... The
          truth is you don't have any real
          conviction.

                         DAVID
          It wouldn't matter.

                         ELISE
          So you don't care about being a
          home-wrecker?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 46.

                         DAVID
          Okay... if you were married it would
          matter.

                         ELISE
          Now you're just trying to say what
          you think I want to hear.
          A beat. She lets David twist in the wind...

                         ELISE
          I'm single.
          ON David's face: relief...

                         ELISE
          Now let's hear your bullshit excuse
          for never calling me.

                         DAVID
          I didn't have your number.

                         ELISE
          What?

                         DAVID
          It was taken from me. I was
          mugged.

                         ELISE
          Oh, come on.

                         DAVID
          Your number was in my Wallet and
          they ,:took it.

                         ELISE
          Come on..

                         DAVID
          I'm serious. What else could
          possibly-explain my fawning all
          over you on that bus three years
          ago...and again today and not
          calling you in between?

                         ELISE

                         (DUH)
          Um, you had a girlfriend and you
          felt guilty. I have a thing about
          being lied to, David.

                         DAVID
          I swear to God I didn't have your
          number. I swear on my parents'
          graves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 47.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          I didn't even have a last name to
          try to track you down. Do you know
          how many pages come back when you
          type "Elise" into Google?

                         (BEAT)
          And none of them were you.

                         ELISE
          (after a beat)
          You really are smooth.

                         DAVID
          That's not fair.

                         ELISE
          It's okay. I like it. I probably
          shouldn't, but I do.

                         (BEAT)
          It's Sellas. Elise Sellas.

          INT. RICHARDSON'S OFFICE -- DOWNTOWN -- DAY

          McCrady holds open his Planbook to show Richardson an ever
          shifting diagram.

                         RICHARDSON
          Tell me you're kidding. How could
          our Path-analysis miss this?
          McCrady just shakes his head, mystified... Richardson walks
          to the closet and pulls out his fedora:.

                         RICHARDSON
          'rlhek,e are they now?`

                         MCCRADY
          Central Park. Bethesda Fountain.

          INT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY

          David and Elise walk past Bethesda Fountain.

                         ELISE
          I read somewhere you're running
          again.

                         DAVID
          I haven't announced yet but... soon.

                         ELISE
          I hope I had a little something to
          do with that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 48.

                         DAVID
          That concession speech I gave sure
          did. You had everything to do with
          that.
          Elise smiles.

                         DAVID
          You know entirely too much about me
          given how little I know about you.

                         ELISE
          According to Cosmo I'm supposed to
          keep it that way.

                         DAVID
          According to Maxim, I'm supposed to
          "maintain eye contact and ask you

          Oh..

                         DAVID
          I think you have the wrong idea
          about me.

                         ELISE
          I think it was the first thing that
          crossed your mind.

                         DAVID
          Is there a performance of this
          company coming up that I could
          watch?

                         ELISE
          Actually, we have a show opening
          tomorrow night.

                         DAVID

          He points at the Boathouse restaurant a few hundred feet down
          the path they're on.

          Yeah...

          But I'm not putting out just
          because you're buying me brunch.

                         DAVID
          We could wait an hour and call it
          lunch.

          I bet lines like that work wonders
          with the "dancers" you normally
          hang out with.

                         ELISE
          Ballet is basically impossible to
          do correctly.

                         DAVID
          Why?

                         ELISE
          You just do absurd things. with your
          body. The movement is completely
          unnatural. It requires incredible
          strength in all sorts of random
          muscles. And you have to be born
          with ridiculous amounts of
          flexibility in your hip or you'll
          never be an y good.

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          McCrady examines his Planbook diagram. With each new update

          If they kiss...

                         RICHARDSON

                         (DISBELIEVING)
          A kiss, that's all it takes?

                         MCCRADY
          A real kiss. But once they do that
          every possible adjustment that's
          strong enough to break them up will
          cause ripples over your limit.

          If Melton and Morris do their jobs
          right we'll be okay.

          In the history of ballet there've
          only been a handful of people who
          actually did ballet the way it's
          supposed to be done. Forme that
          just made it completely addictive.

                         DAVID
          Do you ever get nervous when people
          watch you?

                         ELISE
          Not really. Do you get anxious
          when you make 'a speech?

                         DAVID
          I get more anxious alone in my

                         CHARLIE
          I'm wrangling him right now--

          DAVID AND ELISE

                         DAVID
          Whatever happens...I'm not going to
          let anything stand between us this
          time.
          It's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what David
          has gone through. She gives him a quizzical look. But
          she's also moved by his,tone

                         ELISE
          Okay.:.. I believe you. Of course
          I tend to believe in the wrong
          people. Especially men.
          It's the kind of quip that's more truth than jest.

                         DAVID
          Not this time.
          He leans in to kiss her--

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          A horrified look from Richardson--

          INT. BAR AREA -- DAY

          David kisses Elise on the cheek. But he lingers...
          Then pulls. away without going further...

                         DAVID
          I'll see you in two hours.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 58.

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          Richardson and his colleagues all breathe a large sigh of
          relief.. .as they watch David leave.

                         MCCRADY
          We're okay...

                         RICHARDSON
          That was way too close. What the
          hell is going on with this case?

          INT. TOWN CAR -- DAY

          David and Charlie ride in the back. Charlie looks at David.

                         DAVID
          What?

                         CHARLIE
          I've just never seen you like that.
          David can't possibly explain.

                         CHARLIE
          "I'm going to-postpone my
          announcement to have brunch with a
          woman?" Postpone any speech. I
          know she made an impression on you
          but this is ...
          Charlie just shakes his head, unable to comprehend. A beat.

                         CHARLIE
          "What is it about her?

                         DAVID

                         (BEAT)
          I don't know...

          EXT. RSR FINANCIAL BUILDING -- DAY

          David pulls up outside. Hundreds of his supporters and the
          press are waiting for him. He gets out of the car to cheers.

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          Richardson stands with McCrady on the upper level of a two-
          story lobby looking out at David arriving for his speech.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 59.

          INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

          Elise changes into her dance gear. Big smile on her face.
          She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and
          her smile fades. She takes it and puts it in a drawer.
          Her phone vibrates. She has a text message: "Power back on
          at MMB. Rehearsal at noon."

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          McCrady hangs up a silver cell phone and nods at Richardson:
          "it's done." Just then Richardson's phone buzzes. The
          caller ID says: "Mr. Donaldson."

                         RICHARDSON
          Richardson. Yes, sir. Believe me,
          it was a surprise to me too. But
          I think we have it under control.

          INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          Elise and her friend, LAUREN, 20s, stretch between routines.
          An unexpected smile spreads across Elise's face.

                         LAUREN
          Oh, you're clone. You're gone...

          MINUTES LATER -- DAY
          A half-dozen news organizations, film the speech.

                         DAVID
          .I'm here today to honor that,
          and to announce my intention to run
          for the United States Senate...

          INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY


                         LAUREN
          Just tell me if he disappears one
          more time you'll never take his
          call again.

                         ELISE
          Don't worry. That's definite.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 60.

          EXT. RSR FINANCIAL BUILDING -- DAY

          The audience applauds energetically. David nods "thank you"
          and steps away from the lectern they set up. He shakes two
          or three people's hands but then heads inside the building.

          INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          David huddles inside with Charlie. Reporters outside are in
          front of their cameras filing their stories amidst the
          lingering crowd.

                         CHARLIE
          Good Morning America at 7am
          tomorrow, then you have the bankers
          group... David, are you listening?
          David's staring out the window. The sunlight has caught the
          building across the street just right to illuminate
          Richardson and McCrady on the second floor.

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET -- DAY


           RICHARDSON (INTO PHONE)
          I ' 11-keep you = posted, sir.
           Richardson hangs up the phone and turns .t look out at David.
          As he does he real zes David can see him.

                         RICHARDSON
          D` emit !
          Richardson-steps back out of the sunlight.

          MCC- .DY
          What?

                         RICHARDSON
          Get out of the sunlight.
          McCrady, notices David looking, jumps back out of the light.

                         RICHARDSON

                         (FUMING)
          I cannot get a break on this case.

          INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          Charlie is trying to understand what David's staring at.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 61.

                         DAVID
          I have to see Elise now.

                         CHARLIE
          After you go back out there and
          talk to the New York channels--

                         DAVID
          Tomorrow. After GMA.
          He heads for the door. Charlie follows.

                         CHARLIE
          No, we need this on the nightly--
          (catching up to David and

                         STOPPING HIM)
          David...
          Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the right
          words to say to a friend...

                         CHARLIE
          Every time we get close.. .you do
          something to derail it.
          A beat. There's a truth to that. David knows it. But--

                         DAVID
          This is different. Trust me, it's
          different.
          David leaves.

          EXT.. WESTBROADWAY AND MURRAY ST -- DAY

          David looks at thepiece of..paper. An.address on West
          Broadway for "Nyman Studios " He's standing at the locked
          front door. No one inside. Richardson is on to him.
          The surprise on his face turns to anger.. .then resolve.
          He dials Elise's number on his cell. Gets voicemail.

                         DAVID
          Elise ...I doubt you'll ever get
          this message but--

                         JUMP CUT
          David dials 411.

                         DAVID
          Can I have the number for the
          Manhattan Modern Ballet...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 62.
          He looks down to see his phone has zero bars...

          INT. FURNITURE STORE -- DAY

          David goes to the saleswoman.

          EXT. FURNITURE STORE -- DAY

          Through the window we see he saleswoman dial a number ... then
          look at the phone and shrug. It's dead. She and David go
          to her computer. She looks at it, puzzled. It's dead too.
          PULL BACK to REVEAL Richardson and McCrady.

                         MCCRADY
          He's going to go next door:.
          Just then David exits the furniture store and goes next door
          to a clothing store--

                         MCCRADY
          You can't keep.-thephones and
          internet down on the whole block,
          for too much. longer without running
          into ripple problems...

          INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE -- DAY

          David enters :.and goes to an agent.

          INT. REALTOR'S DESK -- DAY.

          Thagent Googles "Manhattan:Modern Ballet." Nothing shows
          RtAL ESTATE AGENT
          Could itbe called something else?

                         DAVID
          Do you have a phone book?

                         JUMP CUT
          David gets to the phone book page that ends with "Manhattan
          Mobile Phone Company." The next page is torn out. David
          slams his fist down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 63.

          EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE -- DAY

          David exits the office to find Richardson on the sidewalk.
          With McCrady nearby.

                         RICHARDSON
          There is an entire world of women
          out there. I thought I made it
          clear this one was off limits.
          David takes off walking.

                         DAVID
          I must have forgotten. It's been a
          while.

                         RICHARDSON
          Doesn't change the fact.
          David looks around, trying to figure out his next move.

                         DAVID
          Why are you so.determined to keep
          us apart?

                         RICHARDSON
          You know: why.

                         DAVID
          The Plan? If there is a Pi ri you
          misread it.

                         RICHARDSON
          There's no misreading what the Plan
          says about you and Elise. It's
          unequivocal.

                         DAVID
          Then your Plan's wrong.

                         RICHARDSON
          Do you realize who wrote this Plan?

                         DAVID
          I don't care.
          Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall.

                         RICHARDSON
          Well you should. You need to learn
          a little more respect.
          David shoves him off. Looks like he might take a swing at
          Richardson. Then his eye catches the complex diagram that
          McCrady is looking at in his Planbook.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 64.

                         DAVID
          Why are you keeping us apart?

                         RICHARDSON
          Because the Plan calls for it.

                         BECAUSE--

                         DAVID

                         (FLARING)
          You put us together three times--

                         RICHARDSON
          That was chance. That wasn't us.

                         DAVID
          Three times? Bullshit! If I'm not
          supposed to be with her then why do
          I feel like this?

                         RICHARDSON
          It doesn't matter what you feel.
          It matters what's in black and
          white.
          David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in
          Richardson's eyes. David stops.. .then his whole expression
          changes...

                         DAVID
          You don't know, do you? You don't
          know why they're keeping us
          apart...

                         RICHARDSON

                         (COVERING)
          'It's not something your mind could
          :comprehend.

                         DAVID
          You're in a nice suit but the
          reality is you're just a minion
          aren't you?
          David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy
          restaurant. McCrady quickly consults his Planbook.

                         MCCRADY
          He's deciding how to--

                         (REALIZING)
          Uh..oh--

          INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY

          David strides in and goes right to a chair. Stands on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 65.

                         DAVID

                         (LOUD)
          Excuse me ladies and gentleman--
          (as people turn and look,

                         RECOGNIZE HIM)
          I'm sorry to disturb your lunch. I
          have a bit of an emergency. Is
          there anybody in this room who's
          ever seen a performance of the
          Manhattan Modern Ballet?

          EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY

          From outside, Richardson and McCrady watch.

                         RICHARDSON
          Son of a bitch.

                         MCCRADY
          He's smart. He's very smart.
          David exits the restaurant from another door. He hurries
          toward West Broadway.

          EXT. WEST BROADWAY -- DAY

          Not a taxi in sight. David looks for one in vain. Suddenly
          Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David.

                         RICHARDSON
          Maybe you should try the subway.
          David holds him in a steely gaze.

                         DAVID'
          Don't all those cab drivers you're
          diverting have Plans too? What
          about all the other people looking
          for cabs in this part of the city
          right n6t? What about their Plans?
          The ripples must be endless...
          Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out.

                         DAVID
          I don't care what you put in my
          way, I'm not going to give up.
          David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 66.

          MINUTES LATER -- DAY
          Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a
          very busy intersection.

                         MCCRADY
          You've got two more minutes keeping
          taxis off West Broadway before--

                         RICHARDSON

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          I need something that's going to
          keep him in place longer--

          EXT. LEONARD ST -- DAY

          On foot, David heads West towards Hudson St. Several taxis
          pass with their roof lights off;. Suddenly, down the street,
          he sees one with his roof light on. He runs for. it when--
          CRASH -- twenty feet in front of him two cars collide. Metal
          crunches and glass breaks. This is no fender bender--

                         DAVID
          Jesus:.,
          (looks for Richardson)
          Is this how far you people will

          Richardson and McCrady rush from a storage room to the

          He nods.

          Wait, he's--

          INT. LOBBY / DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          MUSIC pours out as David opens the door. A quarter of the
          way open, the door stops dead.

          EXT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          Richardson grabs the front door and pulls. It's sealed shut.
          It won't budge.

          sprints to grab it--

          David looks through the narrow space of the open door and
          sees Elise dancing. The piece she's practicing fuses the
          gra e -ballet with the raw emotion of modern. She's ï¿½xl

          Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring
          through the partially open door to the rehearsal room...

          Dammit !
          McCrady's phone buzzes. He pulls it out and looks at the
          caller ID.

                         MCCRADY

                         (DREAD)
          It's Mr. Donaldson.
          Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in
          his hands.
          David turns just in time to see this. At the same time
          David realizes the door is no longer "stuck."

                         RICHARDSON
          Celebrate while you can. They'll
          just kick it upstairs now You
          have no idea what you're up
          against.
          David just looks at him. He'll deal with that when it
          comes...

                         MCCRADY
          Sir?
          Richardson grabs the phone and answers --.going outside to
          talk.
          David turns back to the dance studio. He opens the door to
          get an unobstructed view of Elisee,. She spins, arches, dips.
          David can't take his eyes off hey`
          When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes,
          Elise gives David a. little wave. Then they start again.
          David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but he's
          gone..

          After a moment he signs it at the bottom and looks up,
          REVEALING Richardson, who is standing awkwardly in front of
          his superior's desk.
          Donaldson motions for him to sit down.

          By third grade I was going every

                         DAVID
          That's a lot of motivation for an
          eight year-old.
          She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby
          and they exit on to--

          David's phone buzzes. Caller ID shows it's Charlie.

          I'm a terrible dancer. I don't
          dance.
          Elise climbs out. David follows.

          You're going to teach me to dance
          in one night? Not happening.

                         ELISE
          Are you doubting me?

                         DAVID
          Yes.
          She spins and shoves him against the wall. Forcefully kisses
          him. Then pulls free.

                         ELISE
          Don't.
          She turns and walks into the club. David stands there.

          INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK

          Richardson sits across from Donaldson.

                         DONALDSON
          The disciplinary rules requ-te me
          to. demote you in rank and re-assign
          yot to a less desirable post.
          Donaldson Â±ingers the document he just signed.

                         DONALDSON
          I'm going-'to interpret those rules
          loosely. I'm going to go easy on
          you because,I feel the deck was
          stacked ,against you.
          In a WIDER shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson's
          AIDE sit nearby.

                         DONALDSON
          I'm talking about the intense
          chemistry between them, the
          constant inflection points, and the
          kicker of course: you pulling them
          apart only to have "chance" put
          them back together. Twice. That
          seemed impossible. So I asked
          Burdensky to do some research this
          morning, which he just completed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 76.

                         BURDENSKY
          It seems like these two were meant
          to be together because they were
          meant to be together...

                         RICHARDSON
          What?!

                         BURDENSKY
          Were, in the past, in an earlier
          version of the plan. Actually a
          dozen earlier versions.

                         (BEAT)
          God knows how many artifacts
          pushing them together are left in
          the current plan.

          INT. PLAN B -- DUSK

          A live salsa band has just started. Elise demonstrates Mambo
          for David. Couldn't be farther from the style of dance he
          just saw her rehearse. But she's amazing at it.

                         DAVID
          Serious, serious.trouble...

                         MOMENTS LATER
          Salt, Patron, lime .'-.and two glasses dotin on the bar.

                         ELISE
          Ready?
          Nope.

                         ELISE
          Perfect.
          She yanks him onto the dance floor.

          INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK

          Donaldson, Richardson, Burdensky.

                         RICHARDSON
          Why was it changed?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 77.

                         DONALDSON
          Something important. They went
          from "meant to be together" to "red-
          letter denied relationship" in a
          single Plan revision a few years
          back. As for why, specifically,
          that's apparently above even my pay
          grade...

          INT. PLAN B -- NIGHT

          David and Elise dance. He sucks, but doesn't care. A couple
          of people in the club recognize him and give him thumbs up...

          INT. ADJUSTMENT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS --'NIGHT

          Burdensky and a dejected Richardson walk down the hall.

                         RICHARDSON
          You spend your whole career hoping
          that one day you'll get a "red-
          letter" case. Something you can
          really make a name for yourself
          with. Finally I get one... and
          it's. .booby-trapped...

          CLOSE ON THE BAR'
          Another set of shot glasses hit the bar. UP to REVEAL David
          and Elise..

                         ELISE
          Okay, we've al-ready used up an
          hour, we >etter hurry.
          She pills him toward the exit.

                         DAVID
          Hurry where?

          INT. MUSTANG CLUB -- NIGHT

          Elise does a sexy, street variation on a two-step to an up-
          tempo pop-country ballad. David tries to follow along,
          mostly by bobbing his head with the beat. Sort of with the
          beat.

                         ELISE
          You've got to let yourself feel the
          music.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 78.

                         DAVID
          I've been told I have trouble
          feeling.

                         ELISE
          Whoever said that hasn't seen you
          speak.

                         DAVID
          That's different. I mean--

                         ELISE
          What?

                         DAVID
          In private. With women AlthOugh
          that might be changing. Is there
          any style of dance you can:'t do?

          EXT. HUNTER'S POINT, QUEENS -- NIGHT

          David and Elise walk from the waterfront to the street.

                         ELISE
          Next stop, the best 80s club in the
          city. You ready?

                         DAVID
          To make an ass of myself for the
          third time in one night? Â§4`r, 6'.

                         ELISE

                         (POINTS)
          Race me to that light. You lose,
          you dance, I watch. You win, I
          dance, you watch

                         DAVID'
          What are'the rules of the race---

                         ELISE
          No rules.

                         DAVID
          Hmmm, could get ugly...
          He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something. When
          she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell--

                         ELISE
          You bastard!
          He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 79.

                         DAVID
          Quit complaining and run.
          She catches up. He spins and digs it out. He can't dance,
          but he sure can run. He pulls away and wins.

                         DAVID
          Yes!!!!
          He pumps his arms in a victory dance.

                         ELISE

                         (PISSED SMILE)
          That was good. That was very good.

                         DAVID
          You said "no rules".
          She punches him in the stomach. Hard. He crumples,
          completely unprepared for it.

                         DAVID

                         (IT HURTS)
          Sweet Jesus! Christ on a crutch!

                         ELISE

                         (GIGGLING)
          You said you had trouble feeling.

                         DAVID
          You're insane.

                         ELISE
          We. need a cab.
          He'laughing through the'pain.

                         DAVID
          I'm serious. You're a maniac. You
          should come with a warning label.

                         ELISE
          I do. You just can't see it with
          my clothes on.
          OFF David biting his lip... and PRE-LAPPING the music--

          INT/EXT. A WAREHOUSE CLUB, RED HOOK DOCKS, BROOKLYN -- NIGHT

          David and Elise walk into the synthesizer prelude to "I Can't
          Wait" by Nu Shooz.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 80.

                         DAVID
          Doesn't this song make you feel
          like you're at your high school
          prom?

                         ELISE
          I was six when it came out. So,
          not really.
          Brutal. David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls
          him to the dance floor.

                         MUSIC
          Baby...1-I-I can't wait--

                         STROBE LIGHTS
          As the song kicks in and David and Elise start dancing... A
          couple of kids next to them notice David and start pointing
          and signaling their approval-
          The kids who first spotted David have alerted a few others.
          More people in the crowd cheer him on.

          David and Elise stand on the pier outside the dance club.

                         ELISE
          You grew up over there?
          She indicatesa residential area just behind the docks.

                         DAVID

                         (POINTING)
          I spent any, entire childhood three
          blocks up Carroll Street. We
          didn'.t move-` around a lot.

                         ELISE
          What were you like as a. kid?

                         DAVID
          Before sixth grade I spent about
          half my time in the principal's
          office.

                         ELISE
          You? Really?

                         DAVID
          The only person who spent as much
          time down there as me was a girl I
          had a huge crush on so I didn't
          mind too much.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 82.
          A smile spreads on Elise's face.

                         ELISE
          (re: the docks)
          Did your dad work here?

                         DAVID
          No... My dad filled vending
          machines.

                         ELISE
          And you're going to be a
          senator...

                         DAVID
          After my brother died my Dad wanted
          to get me out of town for a while.
          We went to Washington and the day
          we arrived he took meto the.
          Capitol. We ended up sitting in
          the Senate gallery;,all day.
          (re: Financial' District
          across the river)
          We could see that from the end of
          my block, but-be never once
          encouraged me to go to Wall Street.
          His idol was JFK. He thought
          business guys were selfish.

                         ELISE
          So...areyou doing all this-:f.or
          him?

                         DAVID
          I want to matter. I don't think
          that's just forrhim.
          Elise,. tucks her head into his shoulder.

                         ELISE
          I don't want tonight to mess
          anything..up for you, for the
          campaign.

                         DAVID
          Just make sure I make it to Diane
          Sawyer on time and I'll be fine.
          Elise looks at him for a long beat.

                         ELISE
          You're different... somehow you make
          me believe...

                         DAVID
          Believe what?

          David and Elise make love, FOCUS so SHALLOW that even their
          faces are not always sharp.

          INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          David and Elise lie together, spent.

                         ELISE
          (vulnerability we barely
          glimpsed before this)
          I don't let people in, David. And
          I never let them in this quickly.
          David pulls her close., He-,can't see her eyes. But we can.
          She's struggling with something more...

                         ELISE
          I haven'::t lead a perfect life

                         DAVID

          I'm trying to say .I'm not sure
          somebody running. for office can
          have, me in their life.
          David turns her around so he can see her face, so he knows
          for sure she hears this:

                         DAVID
          I haven't stopped thinking about
          you since the moment I met you. I
          want you in my life--

                         ELISE
          There are skeletons in my closet,

          2/12/09 84.

                         ELISE
          The kind that people use against--

                         DAVID
          Elise, listen! I don't care.
          We'll work it out... I've spent my
          whole life wondering why it takes
          auditoriums of people to fill the
          empty space inside me. Then I met
          you...and realized it doesn't.
          She looks at him. He means it.

                         ELISE
          You scare me.

                         DAVID
          (after a beat)
          That wasn't the effect I was going
          for...
          She smiles...then laughs out-loud--

          7 Thompson's aides seem surprised by the answer.

           INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING -- FRIDAY

          David wakes to find Elise looking at him.

                         DAVID
          You been up long?

                         ELISE
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 85.

                         DAVID
          Did you wake up in. the middle of
          the night?

                         ELISE
          Slept straight through.

                         DAVID
          I thought you never sleep through.

                         ELISE
          I don't.

                         (BEAT)
          I told you, you scare me.
          He kisses her.

                         DAVID
          I won't hurt you.
          They kiss more... and then get swept up by it...

                         LATER
           They lie in bed, post-coital, drained. Blissful. Until the
          phone rings. It's 6:17 am. Early for a call.

                         ELISE
          Hello? :Why, are you calling?

                         (LISTENS)
          No...I... . Look, I have to go...
          She hangs up. David looks at her.

                         DAVID
          What's wrong..

                         ELISE
          That was my , ex. Adrian.

                         DAVID
          Oh... I didn't-- I guess we hadn't
          gotten to that stuff yet...

                         ELISE
          He hasn't called since we broke up.

                         DAVID
          How long?

                         ELISE
          Three months.

                         DAVID
          Was it serious?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 86.
          An awkward beat. Elise opts for complete honesty.

                         ELISE
          We were engaged.

                         DAVID
          What happened?
          Complete honesty.

                         ELISE
          He left...
          David can feel this in the pit of his stomach now.

                         DAVID
          What an idiot.

                         ELISE
          You don't know me that well yet.
          You're still in the wishful
          thinking phase.

                         (BEAT)
          Truth is I should.;-Have left him a
          long time before he left me. It
          was a ,ain' l relationship. It
          hurt tb be i-h it every day.

                         DAVID
          But it was:h'ard to leave.

                         ELISE
          H& knew what buttons., tb push.

                         DAVID `'
          that him?
          DtTid paints at pica re of Elise with an attractive man, arms
          wound each other. lis'e looks surprised, shocked even, to
          tY%'e photo on her b okcase. She nods.

                         ELISE
          David... . It's not... It's over
          between us. Completely over...I
          want to be clear about that. I'm
          pretty sure yesterday was the most
          perfect day I've ever had.

                         DAVID
          Me too.
          David looks at the clock.

                         DAVID
          I have this Diane Sawyer interview.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 87.
          It comes out awkward.

                         ELISE
          I know.
          So did that. They look at each other. Then David reaches
          for his clothes--

                         ELISE
          Can I come? My dress rehearsal's
          not until nine.
          David's face lights up.

                         ELISE
          I'm afraid if I let you out of my
          sight. . .you know...I might never
          see you again...
          A smile creeps across his face...

          INT. GOOD MORNING AMERICA STUDIO -- DAY

          Diane Sawyer interviewsDavid.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          You've overcome enormous obstacles
          in your life and risen to-such
          heights so quickly... People are
          fascinated by you.

                         DAVID
          Only people who haven't spent
          enough time with ' me to know the
          'truth.

          INT. GREEN ROOM .-- DAY-

          Elise watches the:nterview on a big monitor. A soundproof
          window allows her tb see directly into the studio.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          As a speaker and politician you've
          been repeatedly compared to JFK.

                         DAVID
          By my campaign manager mostly.

          DIANE SAWYER (ON TV)

                         (GRINS)
          You're the youngest person ever
          elected to Congress. Which you
          celebrated by getting in a bar
          fight on inauguration night.

                         DAVID
          With a childhood friend. So I
          don't think that counts. And,
          truthfully, that's how we celebrate
          things we're I'm from.

          INT. STUDIO -- DAY


                         DIANE SAWYER
          (grinning bigger now)
          Let's just say you have a habit of
          getting into the press for...other
          uniquely human things as well--

                         DAVID
          that a euphemism, Diane?
          She laughs.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          Most politicians...

          .run aw ay from the embarrassing
          things they've done Yoti,crack,
          jokes about them. You embrace,
          them. Especially since your.;,
          concession speech thr
          ee years ago
          which started as a `sstd-up routine
          and brought tears to my,eyes by the
          .,end when you talked about losing
          Your mother to Lancer and then your
          older brother,,Pdt, to an overdose,
          both whei.you:were only ten years
          old.

          :,INT. STUDIO -- DAY


                         DAVID
          I think Americans are tired of
          electing automatons whose every
          word and move is stage-managed so
          as not to offend anyone. I think
          they want somebody who doesn't hide
          who he is or what he really
          believes. I guess I'm hoping they
          want to elect someone who's
          actually like them.

                         (LAUGHS)
          But I could be very wrong about
          that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 89.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          And if you are?

                         DAVID
          You'd be surprised at the number of
          underwear companies that have
          approached me to be their
          spokesman.
          Diane bursts out laughing. The floor techs are laughing too.

          INT. GREEN ROOM -- DAY

          And so is Elise. She's completely smitten. ON THE TV:
          Diane turns to the camera, trying to stop laughing.

          DIANE SAWYER (ON TV)
          Unfortunately, we're out of time.
          David Norris, announced his
          candidacy for US Senate yesterday.
          Thanks for stopping by.
          It goes to commercial.

          INT. STUDIO -- DAY

          David stays to speak to Diane for a moment-as we MOVE to
          find a stagehand'who is shifting the position of one of the
          big video cameras sed to tape the show. We catch a glimpse
          of his face and see it's Thompson's aide.
          INT<. Gk 2N- R0014 -- DAY
          The- "stagehand" moves thecamera so it's blocking the window
          giving Elise line-of sight to David and Diane.
          Just. then a man with an-.ABC ID enters the room to speak to
          Elise. (We only see his lower half.)

                         ABC ID
          Ma'am, Congressman Norris asked me
          to give you a message.
          We MOVE UP from his ID to REVEAL that the man is another one
          of Thompson's aides.

          THOMPSON AIDE #2 (ABC ID)
          He was just called into a meeting
          that he says is urgent. He says
          he'll call you later and see you at
          your show tonight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 90.

          INT. STUDIO -- DAY

          David and Diane say goodbye to each other. He salutes the
          floor staff, who actually applaud. They love him.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          (to David, re: earpiece)
          They're saying your girlfriend --
          can we call her that? Is this one
          going to last more than a month?

                         DAVID
          You can call her that. And yes.
          Definitely.
          David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks. It says:
          "I want to go to bed with you."

                         DIANE SAWYER
          They're saying she's getting a tour
          of the control room in studio C.
          Can somebody take Congressman
          Norris to studio C?
          Thompson's aide signals David to follow him. David does.
          They walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor.

          INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

          Thompson's aide leads him through a heavy door marked "Studio
          C" into a, vestibule and then through another heavy door into--

          INT. '':STUDIO C" -- DAY

           A partially-built set in the center of an empty stage. Elise
           isn't here. Thompson's aide feigns surprise.

           T HOMPSON'S AIDE #2
           They said she was here... . Hang on.
          David pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal. He
          looks up to see Thompson's aide exit through the stage door.
          It suddenly clicks for David, and he rushes to the door.
          Yanks on it. It's locked.

                         DAVID
          God dammit!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 91.

          INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

          Through the thick window of the outer door we can see David
          pounding on the window of the inner door.
          But we can't hear a sound.
          PULL BACK to REVEAL Thompson's aide removing the"Studio C"
          placard. Beneath is the true designation: "Studio D."
          PAN to REVEAL three Thompson aides removing a false wall that
          was hiding a bunch of construction equipment and setting up
          "No Entry -- Construction Zone" signs.

          QUICK CUTS -- FRANTIC HANDHELD
          1) David across the room tugs on another exit. It's locked.
          2) David pulls a fire alarm. Nothing.
          3) David slams on the door with a two-by-four.

          LONGER CUTS -- COMPOSED DOLLY SHOTS
          1) Diane Sawyet talks about the issue of the day as we pull
          back and show her. co-hosts on the couch.
          2) Elise arrives in the lobby of the Manhattan Modern Ballet
          for her company's dress rehearsal.

          INT STUDIO D (EARLIER ".STUDIO'.C") -- DAY
           David sits. His tie..loose now. His jacket off. He glances
          at his blackberry. the time reads 4:13 pm. He yells in
          frustration.

                         VOICE
          If people could hear you out there
          it wouldn't be a very good
          soundstage, would it?
          David turns to see Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit
          and fedora.

                         THOMPSON
          My name's Thompson.

                         DAVID
          What happened to Free Will?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 92.

                         THOMPSON
          Who said anything about Free Will?
          David stares back at him.

                         THOMPSON
          You know, we actually tried Free
          Will before. After taking you from
          hunting and gathering to the height
          of the Roman Empire we stepped back
          to see how you'd do on your own.
          You gave us the Dark Ages -- for
          five centuries -- until finally we:
          decided we should come back in.

                         (BEAT)
          The Chairman thought maybe we just
          needed to do a better job of
          teaching you how to ride the bike
          before we took the training wheels
          off again. So we gave you the
          Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the
          Scientific Revoluton.:ï¿½we spent
          six hundred years tempering your
          passions with reason.,then in 1910
          we stepped ba ï¿½c again. Within
          fifty yearsï¿½you brought us World
          War I, the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the
          Holocaust ani capped it off by
          bringingtheentire planet to the
          brink of destruction in the Cuban
          Missile Crisis. A decisiOfl was
          taken atthat point that we' should
          stop in again before Â±ou did
          _soittething even we Cduldn't fix.

                         (BEAT)
          You on't have_ Free Will, David,
          you have the appearance of Free
          =Will.

                         DAVID
          You expect me.'to believe that?

                         THOMPSON

                         (BORED SHRUG)
          You have Free Will over what tie
          you pick in the morning, or what
          beverage to order at lunch. But
          humanity just isn't mature enough
          to have control over the important
          things.

                         DAVID
          If you're in control of the
          important things then you're
          incompetent cause when I look
          around at the world these days it
          seems pretty fucked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 93.

                         THOMPSON
          It's still here. If we'd left
          things in your hands, it wouldn't
          be.

                         DAVID
          Why are you trying to keep me from
          Elise? Or are you just another
          lackey who doesn't really know?
          Thompson studies David for a long beat. Then decides it's
          time to level with him.

                         THOMPSON
          We put Elise in front of you three
          years ago to inspire you to, .g `ve
          that speech -- the speech that
          pulled you back from the brink of
          oblivion and, overnight, itiade.you
          the front runner for this coming
          election. The intervention on
          Charlie was to prevent the hedge
          fund you had just become vice
          chairman of from going belly up in
          the sub-prime=crisis, bringing two
          major banks down. with it, arid in ,
          the process making you unelectable.

           this election?

          THOMP50N,
          This 'one and six mom, after it.
          And t'm not just talking about
          `elections ' for Senate.
          lowly dawns on David what Thompson is saying...

                         THOMPSON
          You can matter, David. Really
          matter. What you wanted your whole
          life. What your father wanted when
          he took you to the Senate gallery
          when you were ten. What your
          brother wanted when he made you
          promise, the day before he
          overdosed, that you wouldn't be
          like him.

                         DAVID
          Stop. Don't tell me this.

                         THOMPSON
          Why do you think you have that
          yearning to be in front of
          people. . .and that terrible
          emptiness when you're not?

                         DAVID
          Stop.

                         THOMPSON
          David you are meant to change the
          world. But that doesn't happen if
          you stay with her.

                         DAVID
          Why does it matter to you who I
          love? Some skeleton of hers `is so
          bad I won't get elected? I don't
          believe that!

                         THOMPSON
          It's not about her-:..it's about
          you, what being with her does to

                         YOU -

                         DAVID-
          What does that mean?! I'm better
          with her than I ever was alone.,
          You just said it. That speech--

                         1HOMPSON
          Yes. The speech... Put it this
          wad: in small doses, Elise was the
          cure. But in large doses... When
          you're enthralledwith someone she
          ' rubs off on you:.

          I'm a politician. I spend my life
          with professional liars. With
          people who decide what they want

          have to tell to get it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 95.

                         THOMPSON
          Why do you refuse to accept what
          should be completely obvious by
          now? You've seen what we can do.
          You can't doubt we are who we say
          we are.

                         DAVID
          I don't care who you are. I don't
          care who's orders you're following.

                         THOMPSON
          You can't outrun your fate, David.

                         DAVID
          Who said anything about running.

                         THOMPSON
          Maybe we should just reset you.

                         DAVID
          We both know if you could have we
          wouldn't be standing here having
          this conversation...
          Thompson stares back. He's never dealt with such
          temerity...

                         THOMPSON
          You fight us, we will take
          everything from you.

                         DAVID
          You already did once.' And I'm
          still standing...

                         (BEAT)
          always knew you were out there.
          We all do. It's the one thing we
          have in common. Whether we call
          it God or the Devil or Fate we all
          know you're out there, fucking with
          us...

                         THOMPSON
          You'd still be living in caves if
          it weren't for us.

          You crush our dreams because they
          don't fit with your Plan. Your

          The only thing we have in this
          fucked up world are the choices we
          make. And there's nothing you can
          do to me that will get me sign them
          away.

          Kill me. Or erase me. Or let me
          go.
          Thompson stares back at him, dumbfounded. A long silence,

                         THEN:

                         THOMPSON
          It's 6:20. If you leave now,
          you'll make Elise's show.
          David's eyebrows go up. Huh? Thompson is letting him go?

          EXT. GOOD MORNING AMERICA STUDIOS: .--..DUSK

          David jumps into a taxi.

          INT. TAXI -- DUSK

           David sits in the back seat, taking everything in, turning it
           over and over in his head... .'

          INT. THEATER -- ELISE'S DANCE COMPAMY

          Elise and twb of her colleagues "finish a dance piece. The
          audience explodes into applause.
          The house lights come up half way as the stage is readied for
          the next piece,. David is startled to see that the man in the
          aisle seat next to-him is Thompson.

                         T-4 MPSON
          She's a beautiful dancer.

                         DAVID
          What do you want?

                         THOMPSON
          There's one more piece to all this
          I haven't told you. I guess I
          didn't have the heart. If you stay
          with her, it doesn't just kill your
          dreams, it kills hers.

                         DAVID
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 97.

                         THOMPSON
          Elise is about to become one of the
          most famous dancers in the
          country... and eventually one of the
          greatest choreographers in the
          world.

                         (BEAT)
          If she stays with you... she ends up
          teaching dance to eight year-olds.

                         DAVID
          I don't believe you. I thought we
          already established that.
          A beat.

                         THOMPSON
          When you look back at all this,
          David, just remember, we tried to
          reason with you.
          Thompson gets up and leaves...just as the lights go down for
          the next dance.
          David watches him go...then turns around just in time to
          catch Elise's entrance into the dance -- a graceful jump.
          When she lands, her ankle cracks, and she falls. The
          audience gasps.
          INSERT: a floor board tilted oddly. It goes back to normal.
          FIND THOMPSON: His hand slightly outstretched.
          THE AUDIENCE instantly knows something is wrong. David jumps
          up and runs down to the.: stage door. A dancer comes from off
          stage and helps Elise off the floor as the show continues.

          INT BACK STAGE -- NIGHT
          .A company staff member is examining Elise's ankle while the
          show goes on.
          David arrives. Sees Elise's face. Tears streaming down her
          cheeks. Seeing David...

                         ELISE
          If it's broken...my career's over.

                         DAVID
          Don't say that. Don't.

           The taxi rushes to the hospital. David holds her. Silently
          trying to comfort her. But he can't look at her.

          David carries her from the taxi into the emergency room...

          David is still staring at the floor. He looks-up to see
          Thompson.

                         THOMPSON
          I always hear people saying "you
          yourself for what can't bla M4'
          hpens fih other people," but in
          this case, really, you can.
          David stands up...
           . and punnhesThompson in `the face.
          h T ompson is knocked onto his ass.
          People in the waiting room stare at David. Almost everyone
          here knows his fade. He looks at them, unable to summon his
          usual wit.

                         THOMPSON
          This is what you do, David.

                         (GETTING UP)
          This is what you did the first
          night you got elected. This is
          what you did at that college
          reunion. We give you opportunities
          people would kill for and you
          squander them with impulse. It
          doesn't take a genius to see Elise
          isn't exactly going to help you
          with that.

          Thompson leaves.

          More X-rays of Elise's ankle. An orthopedic surgeon enters

          Really?

          This time.

                         (BEAT')
          Do you really want to watch her
          lose the only thing she's ever
          cared about? You just got the
          tiniest taste of what that looks
          like...
          The thought makes David ill.

                         THOMPSON
          Walk away. If you truly love her,
          walk away. She'll hate you for
          it...but that way she'll be able to
          let you go quickly. You can give
          her that at least.

          confronting the fact that he can't beat the forces arrayed
          against him. Finally ready to make the choice being forced
          upon him...

          INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- DAY

          David enters to find Elise with a huge smile on her face.

                         ELISE
          It's a sprain! It's just a sprain!
          David gives her a tight hug.

                         ELISE
          It's going to be okay. The doctor
          said it would heal in' a
          month. . .maybe even less.

                         DAVID

          They break from them hug.

                         DAVID
          It's; going to be fine. And as
          incredible of a dancer as you
          already are, yot're just going to
          get better and better...
          DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling
          in his eyes.

                         DAVID
          I...I have to go make a few calls.
          His voice cracks. Elise notices.

          You okay?

          You're doing the right thing,
          David. Not just for her, and the

          David looks at him for a beat, then turns and walks away into

          How's he doing?

                         CAMPAIGN AIDE
          They still love him... Papers?
          The aide hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers,
          the Times, the Journal, and the three big NYC tabloids.

                         CHARLIE
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 102.
          The aide leaves. Charlie glances at the front page of the
          Times, then reaches for the New York / Region section. As he
          does the front page of the Arts section catches his eye.
          There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split,"
          accompanying an article titled "Dance Takes a Quantum Leap."
          Charlie glances through the window at David who is climbing
          down from the pickup truck to applause from his parking lot
          audience.

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- MORNING

          David shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his
          speech. They really do love him.

          INT. DINER, UPSTATE NEW YORK MORNING

          Charlie reads the New York Times. article. It begins:
          "Once in a generation a piece is created of
          such astounding originality and virtuosity
          that it single-handedly reshapes. the. world of
          dance."

                         FOLLOW DAVID
          As he makes his way, towards the diner'f-tom the parking lot,
          shaking handb and allowing his picture to be taken.

          INT: DINER, UPSTATE NEW YORK -- DAY
          David sits down with Charlie.

                         DAVID
          I'm started.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm going to show you this because
          you'd find out eventually and
          because I want to be here when you
          do.
          Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it.
          Elise's photo has a noticeable impact on David. He glances
          at the article for a moment.
          Then Charlie points down near the bottom, at a particular

                         SENTENCE:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 103.
          "The show's choreographer, Adrian Troussant,
          and lead dancer, Elise Sellas, are partners on
          and off stage and plan to marry in New York
          next week."
          David stares at the words...

                         CHARLIE
          David?
          (off no response)
          David?

                         DAVID
          I think I need... I...

                         CHARLIE
          Take a day off. Take a couple.
          We're sixteen points up.

                         DAVID

                         (HOLLOWED OUT)
          Even I can't blow a lead that big.

          EXT. RED HOOK, BROOKLYN NIGHT

          It's pouring rain. David walks down Carroll Street. Most of
          the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs.
          Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is
          clearly in the early'stages of gentrification.
          David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes
          by. Was this his house?

          EXT. / INT. NEIGHBORHOOD DAR -- NIGHT

          There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in
          the window. David enters this classic dive bar and goes to
          the bartender.

                         DAVID
          Do you still serve neighborhood
          guys here or just the tourists?
          The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar notice
          him. Then others notice and they start whooping it up for
          him. He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him.

          EXT. RED HOOK DOCKS -- NIGHT

          David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers,
          holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 104.
          There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off
          the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls.
          A figure in a suit approaches David from behind. He turns
          to see the man.

                         DAVID
          Why are you here?
          REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.

                         HARRY
          I would have come earlier but I had
          to wait for the rain.
          (off David's confusion)
          Water interferes with their ability
          to sense your decision tree.
          That's why we met on a boat last
          time.

                         (BEAT)
          I guess I'm here to set the record
          straight.

                         DAVID
          About what?

                         HARRY-
          Thompson was lying when he said
          they couldn't let you be with 8lise
          because :it would bring out your
          reckless side.

                         DAVID
          Why, then? Why do they care so
          much?

                         HARRY
          8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If
          you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to
          fill the d side you with votes
          and ataplause'and dreams of one day
          becoming p sident...
          if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.

                         HARRY
          I've watched you a long time.
          They're right to want you in the
          White House. It would be good for
          the world. That's important but it
          can't be the only thing that
          matters.

                         DAVID
          Why are you so different than they
          are?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 105.
          A long beat, then:

                         HARRY
          You know, your Dad was a smart man.
          He could have been a lot more --
          and he wanted to be. So did your
          brother. But the Plan didn't call
          for that.
          This hits David hard.

                         HARRY
          In my job, you implement the
          Plan...

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          And most of the time.. .you don't
          even know why...

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry...

                         DAVID
          My mom?

                         HARRY
          That wasn't me... that wasn't us at
          all.
           David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink.
           Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes
          a drink as well.

                         DAVID
          When Thompson told methe choice
          as Elise or the White House I
          barely hesitated.

                         D1 ID
          But the trt t i `is after making that
          choice I went into a free-fall...
          Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to
          see Thompson hurt her...but I used
          it as an excuse. I think I left
          her more to save my career than
          hers.

                         (STRUGGLING)
          Thompson wasn't lying. The press is
          already talking about me as a
          future president. I'm phoning in
          my speeches and I'm still sixteen
          points up in the polls.

                         HARRY
          The public loves you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 106.

                         DAVID
          Before I met Elise that was all
          that mattered. Now I hardly
          notice. She's all I think about.

                         (BEAT)
          Do you know where she's getting
          married?

                         HARRY
          Front of a judge. Tomorrow
          morning.

                          DAVID
          Is she happy with him? Tell me she
          is and I'll walk away.

                          HARRY
           Thompson won't let you get near
          that courthouse.

                         DAVID
          Harry... is she happy?

                         HARRY
          No.
          A beat.

                         DW-ID
          I have to get her back..
          Harry knows how unlikely that is.

                         DAVID
          Will you help me:ï¿½ Just help me
          get to her...

                         HARDY
          They'll sense )tOu coming a mile
          away.'

                         DAVID
          What if Icould move as fast as you
          can?

                         HARRY
          What do you mean?

                         DAVID
          Teach me about the doors.

                         HARRY
          How do you know about that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 107.

                         DAVID
          The first day, after they caught
          me, they carried me through one.I
          thought it was a hallucination at
          first. Eventually I realized it's
          how you move around so fast.
          (off Harry's reluctance)
          If you don't want to help me
          because of what they'll do to
          you...okay, that's your choice.
          But if this is about protecting me
          then shouldn't the choice be mine?

                         HARRY
          Do you have any idea how
          complicated it is to navigate
          through those doors... how many
          thousands of permutations there are
          in even a simple several block
          journey?

                         DAVID
          You know, when I do town hall
          meetings I usually get introduced
          to forty or fifty people between
          when I walk, through' the door and
          when I start speaking. But when
          I'm done with the speech I can call
          on each one of them by `game.
          A beat...

                         HARRY
          I've seen you do that
          (taking tl leap )
          The rain is supposed to stop in the
          nexthou'r. We're going to need all
          night to do this. And we're going
          to need aplace surrounded by water
          to do it.

                         MOMENTS LATER
          Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the
          end of the pier. Harry dons his hat.

                         HARRY
          Put your hand on my shoulder. And
          don't let go until we've crossed
          the threshold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 108.
          David complies. Harry opens the door.

                         DAVID
          Are they ever locked?

                         HARRY
          Maybe if you have a defective hat.
          They step through the door and onto--

          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- NIGHT

          Harry notices as the rain slows to a drizzle.

                         HARRY
          Hurry.
          Harry runs David to the front dooraf a brownstone. Opens
          the door. They move through i into--

          INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING: STATION -- NIGHT

          Harry stops. David takes-his hand off Harry's shoulder.
          Still amazed by what they just did.

                         HARRY
          We're underneath Canal Street,
          which c as ,,A canal before rt, was a
          street. This is the jcity's':pumping
          station for downtown Manhattan.
          We're ten blocks from the
          courthouse.

          EXT. / INT. ELISE'S DANCE'.- COMPANY -- NIGHT


                         -
          Elise enters, smiles at the receptionist.

                         ELISE
          Floor open?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          (seeing Elise's red eyes)
          You okay, sweetie?

                         ELISE
          I just feel like being on the
          floor.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Everything still on for tomorrow?
          Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 109.

          INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT

          MUSIC BEGINS: something that recalls the sensei-pupil scenes
          in martial arts movies, but at the same time something fluid
          and lyrical (e.g. Yoshida Brothers, "Beyond the Deep Sea.")
          Harry rolls out a block-by-block map of lower Manhattan.
          There are intricate red pen markings all over the map..

                         HARRY
          Lower Manhattan is a nightmare.
          Layer upon layer of substrate --
          that's what we call the system of
          doors -- has been added over time.
          That makes it a lot more complex to
          navigate down here than it is
          uptown. And a lot slower.
          Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and
          exterior, all below Canal Street.

                         HARRY
          You ready?

                         DAVID
          Let's go.
          Harry smiles and hblds,.up a photograph of.the Manhattan
          County Court Building in Foley Squa:e:.

                         HARRY
          Your destination. Courtroom Six.

          INT ` ELISE'S DICE COMPANY-'; -- NIGHT
          The MUSIC CONTINUES". SOURCE music here-. Elise dances to
          it, freestyle. The fluidity and extension of ballet, but
          none of its formality or stiffness.

          INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT


                         DAVID
          (struggling to remember)
          North Moore St. Just south of the
          coffee shop... Red door. I come out
          on Broadway, near Leonard St.
          Harry looks at a photo of what David just described.

                         HARRY
          Good. Keep going.

          Elise continues to dance...

          (eyes closed, trying to

                         PICTURE IT)
          There's an alley in front of me.
          Third door on--

                         HARRY
          Thompson's there.

                         DAVID
          Okay ...so...

          No matter how hard I tried?

          2/12/09 120.
          David calmly turns back to her.

                         DAVID
          You're not supposed to be weeping
          on your wedding day, Elise.
          Elise fights the emotion again welling inside.

                         DAVID
          You were never happy with Adrian.
          You told me that.
          Elise puts her head in her hands.

                         ELISE
          This is so screwed up. Oh,-God..

                         DAVID
          I love you. I know I've acted
          strangely. But, I love you.

                         ELISE
          Don't do this to me.

                         DAVID
          I've never felt anything like. this
          in my life.

                         ELISE
          If you care 'so much, why the hell
          did you disappear on me in that
          hospital?

                         EL SE
          What are you ha.d1 g from me? Why
          did you diS pp`ear " Again! You
          fucking bastard! Why?
          Tears are streaming down her face.

                         DAVID
          They'll reset me...

                         ELISE

                         DAVID--

                         DAVID
          They'll scramble my brain--

                         ELISE
          David, stop talking like this!
          Stop!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 121.
          David looks back at her... Just looks at her. Then he leans
          over and wipes a tear from her face. And he decides...
          He just decides.

                         DAVID
          But at least you'll know the truth.

                         (BEAT)
          I saw behind the curtain, Elise. I
          saw this.
          He opens up Harry's Planbook. Elise sees the intricate
          "wiring diagrams." Sees the lines shift on the page. It
          startles her.

                         DAVID
          It's not in their "Plan" for us to
          be together. So they're trying to
          stop us.

          INT. STAIRCASE -- DAY

          Thompson and minions rush up the stairs.

                         THOMPSON'S AIDE
          Oh myGod... He just revealed us.

          INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY

          Elise stares back at him.

                         ELISE
          Stop talking like a crazy person.
          Stop making things up--

                         DAVID
          They said if we were together
          they'`d take dance from you and
          politic,s,from me. They hurt your
          ankle that night. They--
          The door flies open again. David picks up a trash can and
          clobbers the fedora-wearing man who enters. He drops.

          INT. STAIRCASE -- DAY

          Thompson spins to his aide, finger in his face.

                         THOMPSON
          Call the Intervention Team! Tell
          them it's a square-one reset!

          INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY

          An NYPD shield on the belt of one guy David knocked out.

                         ELISE
          Jesus.. .the cops are after you?!
          David grabs the shield and uses it to wedge the door closed.
          Kicks it in so it's jammed tight.

                         DAVID
          He's not a cop. He's one of them.
          Another body slams into the door now. But the shield holds
          it shut.

                         ELISE
          Who's "them?"
          SLAM! SLAM! The door cracks--

                         ELISE
          Jesus, David!. What's going on?!
          David is impossibly calm. He puts his hat back on.

                         DAVID
          I'm going to: show you.
          He takes Elise's hand, opens the bathroom door, and walks her
          across the threshold into--

                         DAVID
          Come on... We need to lose them.
          David walks her across the street and picks a door at random,

                         OPENS IT--

          EXT. DOOR -- DAY

          David and Elise exit through a door. Her jaw drops.
          REVERSE TO REVEAL Central Park's Sheep Meadow spread before
          them. (They've exited from the building on its north edge).
          Elise steps out onto the grass, touches it, falls to her
          knees in the rain, completely overwhelmed...

          INT. 5TH FLOOR LOBBY / INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY

          A bevy of men in hats push the ladies room door open and rush
          in. They're shocked to see it's empty...

          EXT. SHEEP'S MEADOW -- DAY

          Eliselooks at David

                         DAVID
          The rain slows them down but they
          can track us. We have two orthree
          minutes. Maybe less.
          Elise is still speechless. He takes her hand.

                         DAVID
          The ten year-old in me always mixed
          up winning elections with being
          loved. Then I met` you;,..

                         (BEAT)
          The thing is, if they'd let me be
          with you I wouldn'tk have left
          politipe. t, just would have beef
          in it, or. all the right reasons.
          David pauses for a moment. He can see this' so clearly in his
          head. How can it notbe right?

                         DAVID
          Now you know. Youknota everything.
          And you have to leave mitie.

          somehow she pulls herself together to say this:

          No.

                         DAVID
          You're not safe with me. If you

                         DON'T LEAVE--
          She puts her finger to his lip. Shhhh...

                         ELISE
          It doesn't make any sense but,
          right now I feel safer than I've
          ever felt before.

          INT. THE CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

          The Chairman's Office is the size of the reading room at the
          New York Public Library. Thirty foot high.ceilings. A dozen
          assistants perform various tasks very quietly, giving it more
          the feel of a papal court, than a corporate office.
          We see THE CHAIRMAN from behind only ..but we can still tell
          he is utterly calm and in complete control.
          An aide comes to The Chairman's--desk,.sets two open leather
          folios in front of him.

          AIDE TO-HE'"CHAIRMAN

          Thompson and a dozen other men with hats step out into the
          rain, scan the horizon for any sign of their quarry.

          David and Elise head towards a door across the street from
          the Banana Republic.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          They emerge through a door on the 125th Street Metro-North
          platform. Run down the stairs to street level.

          INT. BANANA REPUBLIC -- DAY

          Thompson and a half-dozen minions emerge from the same
          dressing room David and Elise did. The seventeen year-old
          attendant presses back against the wall, totally freaked now.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          David and Elise head toward a storefront church.

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          Thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing NYPD
          badges and asking questions. /

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          David and Elise enter the church and--

          EXT STONE FACADE -- DAY
          -- exit from a metal door in a stone facade. PULL BACK to
          REVEAL that they are standing at the base of the Statue of
          Liberty...
          Elise looks out at the harbor and the city. Rain pelts her
          face. And she smiles. Exhilarated. Like a prisoner who has
          just broken her chains...

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          Rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by
          Thompson and his men. A black Suburban with under-grill
          police lights pulls up fast.

                         DAVID
          If they find us ...they'll take you
          from me.

                         ELISE
          I won't let..them.

                         DAVID
          They'll take you from here.
          David touches his head'.

                         ELISE
          No, I won't let them.

          INT T. ?RE 'WAR APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
           David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.

                         DAVID
          Perfect.
          David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It's

                         ONE --
          locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise tries
          shakes her head.

                         DAVID
          They're not supposed to be locked!
          David hears sounds coming from the building's central
          staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits
          climbing up the stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 127.
          DING. The elevator door down the hall opens. More men in
          silver suits.

                         ELISE
          This one's open!
          Elise is standing at the door to the roof. David runs to her
          and they go up the stairs together to--

          EXT. ROOF -- DAY

          David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some
          concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on
          them.
          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are
          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen
          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;
          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the
          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They
          hang their legs over the edge and jump.
          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --
          except somehow they find themselves running across the same
          roof they were just on.
          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open
          from inside.
          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the
          building's edge they climb over again and... run...
          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as
          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
          roofs. They're completely surrounded.

                         ELISE
          Kiss me.
          Tears well in her eyes. And his.

                         ELISE
          Close your eyes and kiss me.
          He does. And they kiss in the rain...

                         ELISE
          I love you, David Norris.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 128.
          They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally,
          open their eyes.. .ready to accept their fate--
          They see an empty roof. The Silver Suits are gone. And the
          rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them...
          They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing
          there, alone.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Hello, David... Good morning,
          Elise.
          His voice is gentle, paternal.

                         DAVID
          Who are you?

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          I think you know.
          David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.

                         DAVID
          You can't oti{rn Fate...
          Tft , CHAIRMAN
          It's .more- complicated t,}an that,
          Fate am Free Will coexist
          They're;in tension with each other.
          And pure chance.
          A beat. David looks back at him...

                         DAVID

          TH2;.>ï¿½HAT, RMAN
          I could control 'everything. You'd
          be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets. I
          try to .keep things from getting too
          out of control. But that has a
          cost. Most people go through life
          like pinballs, reacting predictably
          to the stimuli I apply. They
          accept the path they find
          themselves on. And perform
          accordingly. But every once in a
          while someone comes along who
          refuses to be bound by his fate,
          someone who understands that Free
          Will is a gift most people are too
          afraid to use.

                         (BEAT)
          Which, you see, is partly the point
          of all this.

          THE CHAIRMAN (cont'd)
          Or maybe you don't see it. Maybe
          you just feel it. And that's even
          better. Because that's the other
          part.
          David and Elise take it in...

                         DAVID
          And all the misery, all the pain...

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          I sit up there and I watch it and
          it hurts me... . but if you could see
          the incredible courage people show,
          the random acts of kindness, the
          love... If you could see huitan
          beings choosing every moment
          every day to be better thAn'' I made
          them, you would know it's all
          worthwhile.

                         (BEAT)
          Good luck, David. And good luck to
          you, Elise. You're a-beautiful
          dancer. And so much more...
          The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Their case isclosed.

          AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN
          But, Sir,isn't this a majtr.
          deviation from The Plan?
          The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
          open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Not anymc3e .
          David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by
          what=they've just experienced. As He disappears around a
          corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ...
          After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say
          "what do we do now?"

                         DAVID
          Maybe we should go dancing.
          A smile slowly spreads across her face ...

		Re:  Project Sawtooth

FADE IN:

EXT.  SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY	1

Beside a 1950 Ford, a quartet of elite intellectuals poses 
playfully...dressed in the local custom of boots and cowboy hats, the 
TOW ORIENTAL MEN, A CAUCASIAN MAN, AND A CAUCASIAN WOMAN squint into 
the hot sun and then down at the jiggling home movie camera, the 
operator lopsided...

NARRATOR
The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase 
of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms.  Stung by this Soviet 
challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated 
weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi 
Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the 
dismal record of failure that has dogged the project.

TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from 
its present operator, a four-year-old child...A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND 
COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian 
woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him...

NARRATOR
Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares 
himself anxious to work for the Allies.  Enamored of the great American 
West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child "Buckaroo."  
A tribute to his adopted homeland.

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	2

A strange TWO-MAN SPEED VEHICLE readies for takeoff...the FIRST "PILOT" 
in the cockpit Dr. Banzai himself:

NARRATOR
And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory 
disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School 
of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to 
gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass 
unharmed through solid matter.

The SECOND "PILOT," a fair-haired Caucasian:	3

NARRATOR
Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy, affable limey, co-developer 
with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced 
theoretical gravity catapult...

	4
The fourth scientist, the female Caucasian, busy with last-minute 
details, securing the two pilots in their seats, checking their 
instrument data, writing on a clipboard...

NARRATOR
Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in Negative Mass Propulsion 
...wife of Dr. Masado Banzai.

...as the four-year-old BUCKAROO BANZAI now approaches the speed 
machine and gives his father a good-bye kiss...Dr. Banzai saying 
something to the boy, Buckaroo bowing respectfully, as his father and 
mother exchange last-minute assurances...

The cockpit canopy comes down, and Sandra Banzai tugs a reluctant 
little Buckaroo toward a sandbagged shelter...

EXT.  SANDBAGS - DAY	5

...where Professor Hikita sits at a bank of monitoring equipment, 
Sandra Banzai and Buckaroo entering the enclosure as...

...A SUDDEN NOISE causes Sandra Banzai to turn in fear, the bizarre 
speed machine's motors whining at an astonishing rpm, BLINDING GREEN 
FLAMES ENGULFING ITS COCKPIT...

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	6

...Sandra Banzai rushing toward the sheet-metal vehicle through SMOKE 
AND GREEN FLAME as her husband and Sir Alan both struggle to get out...

	7
...Buckaroo running after his mother who attempts to help the 
scientists free themselves when suddenly the child is thrown to the 
ground and protected by Professor Hikita's own body...as the 
experimental car VAPORIZES IN A FLASH OF EMERALD GREEN LIGHT!  THE 
SCREEN GOING WHITE, A LAUNCH COUNTDOWN BEGINNING UNDER A SOMBER CARD:

TODAY
THIRTY YEARS LATER

VOICE OF MISSION CONTROL
T Minus five hundred and counting.  Phaser positive.  Latch compressor.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	8

CLOSE ON AN OLDER, WISER PROFESSOR HIKITA:

PROF. HIKITA
Power source output, zero-zero-niner.  Multi-stage axial compressor 
latched.

EXT.  JET CAR - PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	9

One hundred yards from a concrete blockhouse, a SERIES OF MYSTERIOUS 
CLOSEUPS of an UNUSUAL STRATEGIC AUTOMOBILE sitting ready to roll, as 
TECHNICIANS in asbestos suites fill its tanks with HIGHLY FLAMMABLE 
FUEL.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	10

PROF. HIKITA
Fuel pressure, 1800 torrs.  Oxygenation.

...amid television screens, monitoring devices...an elite assortment of 
GOVERNMENT VIPS, MILITARY MEN, AND NEWS MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES standing 
by...

	11
...one such observer, GENERAL CATBURD, an AIDE approaching, whispering 
unpleasant news in his ear...

GENERAL CATBURD
You're kidding. Where is he?  Still in the hospital? 

The aide shrugging, the General leaning over to a nervous man sitting 
next to him...SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY.

GENERAL CATBURD
Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr. Secretary. Looks like he's got cold feet.

Another angle.  Two of Buckaroo's men, RENO and PERFECT TOMMY, sitting 
with their boots on a computer console.

PERFECT TOMMY
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.

RENO
Why me?

...an attractive NETWORK TV ANCHORWOMAN headed this way...

PERFECT TOMMY
'Cause I'm busy.  And get your clodhoppers off the UNIVAC.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	13

THE EYES OF DOCTOR BUCKAROO BANZAI, THE REST OF HIS FACE HIDDEN BY A 
SURGICAL MASK...such concentration.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	14

...a phone ringing, a NURSE answering it, then:

NURSE
Rawhide, it's for you.

Jacketless, A SINISTER PISTOL visible in the tooled leather shoulder 
holster, RAWHIDE takes the receiver.

RAWHIDE
I'll ask him.
(into his Go-Fone)
Buckaroo, I need an estimate.  They're getting antsy over at Mission 
Control.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	15

Buckaroo Banzai speaks into his GO-FONE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another ten minutes down here, Rawhide.

REVEALING DOCTOR BANZAI, the great surgeon, surrounded by a well-oiled 
team of physicians and nurses...his steady, miraculously skilled hands 
working a LASER KNIFE on the brain of a PATIENT sitting clamped in a 
serious chair.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	16

RAWHIDE
(into phone)
The chief needs ten more minutes.  I got the chopper waiting.  Don't 
start without us.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	17

Perfect Tommy still leaning back in his swivel chair, smiling at the 
blonde TV anchorwoman, waiting for her CAMERAMAN to set up...

TV ANCHORWOMAN
So where's Buckaroo?

PERFECT TOMMY
(a wry smile)
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?

The anchorwoman catching his drift, smiling, knowing Perfect Tommy 
perhaps intimately...Perfect Tommy glancing across the crowded room at 
Reno raising ten fingers...

PERFECT TOMMY
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you 
doing tonight?

TV ANCHORWOMAN
(picking up his hat)
Flying to Cambodia.

Perfect Tommy frowning severely as she tried on his Stetson, the 
anchorwoman promptly getting the message and putting it back down.

PERFECT TOMMY
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I 
hadda kill you.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Bet I do.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	18

Another STAR SURGEON, scrubbing for an operation next door now peeking 
at his wrist watch TV:

CLOSE ON THE TINY TV:  AN IMAGE OF THE JET CAR...	19

ANGLE ON...	20

STAR SURGEON
Jesus Christ...how does the man find enough hours in the day?

RAWHIDE
We help.

The surgeon curious, studying the big TV monitor, Rawhide sensing an 
explanation is in order:

RAWHIDE
Dr. Banzai's using a laser to fuse artificial nerve fiber to the 
original, bypassing massive stroke damage.  A subcutaneous microphone's 
gonna allow the patient to transmit verbal instructions to his own 
brain.

STAR SURGEON
What, like "raise my left arm"?

RAWHIDE
Or "throw the harpoon," depending on cultural differences. People are 
gonna come from all over. This guy's an Eskimo.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	21

Buckaroo winding down the surgery.  A BRILLIANT BUT ERRATIC JEWISH 
PHYSICIAN at his side whispering through a mask...

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Okay...right...okay, I see...next time I'll be able to...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There may not be a next time.

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Look...I'm sorry...calling for help in the middle of an operation...but 
I just lost my nerve...I panicked...again.

Buckaroo picking a NIKON up off a table, snapping some pictures of his 
handiwork...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You've got the God-given tools to be a success in any field of 
endeavor, Dr. Zwibel.  Ever thought about joining me full-time?

JEWISH PHYSICIAN (DR. ZWIBEL)
Are you serious?  Have you have an opening?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can you sing?

DR. ZWIBEL
A little. I can dance.

Buckaroo glancing at the clock on the wall...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	22

PROF. HIKITA
Inertial Control positive.  T minus seven zero and resume counting.

MISSION CONTROL
All systems righteous.  Professor Hikita says we have to go.

General Catburd and other VIPS happy to observe on their TV monitors 
the sight of a MAN IN BLACK COMMANDO PARACHUTE SUIT, carrying a 
BATTERED OLD BRIEFCASE, climbing into the cockpit of...THE JET CAR.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY

THE DRIVER'S POV, a curious combination of airplane dials and switches 
and personal touches like a big four-on-the-floor gear shift and a 
snazzy pearlized Brodi knob with snowflakes and a coochi-coochi girl...

	24
ANGLE ON the driver as he removes a strange GRYOSCOPIC DEVICE from his 
briefcase, plugs it into a cradle near his head...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	25

Professor Hikita standing at a special monitor as a light pops on, 
indicating "Overthruster Armed"....he covers it with a hanky...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	26

...all quiet suddenly, the car poised, waiting...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	27

General Catburd grabbing some coffee and doughnuts...the Secretary of 
Defense peering out through a viewing slot...

GENERAL CATBURD
I've got a budget meeting on the hill, John.  What's this thing 
supposed to do anyway?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Three hundred miles an hour, General.

GENERAL CATBURD
Senator, you are so fulla shit.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
May not...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	28

The Jet Car undergoing an amazing transformation:  TWO STABILIZER FINS 
AND A JET ENGINE suddenly appearing on its rear deck...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	29

CLOSE ON THE DRIVER TO REVEAL BUCKAROO BANZAI, world famous figure in 
every field of endeavor as he withdraws a beautiful KAMIKAZE SCARF from 
his flight suit...wraps it like a warrior's headband around his 
helmet...

	30
ANGLE ON Buckaroo's hand as his fingers flip a row of toggle switches, 
THE PULSATING POWER OF THE JET ENGINE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY with each 
successive switch...the vehicle a caged beast, taunting us, as Buckaroo 
flips the last switch...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Final contact is made.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	31

No kidding.  A TWENTY FOOT SHEET OF FIRE ROCKETING FROM THE BACK OF THE 
JET CAR...THEN ANOTHER...THEN ANOTHER...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	32

The Cavaliers at their monitors, calm...Hikita making minor adjustments 
on his instrument bank...the Secretary of Defense and General Catburd 
both now at viewing slots in the blockhouse wall...

PROF. HIKITA
Point of no return...five, four, three, two...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	33

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
...one.

As Buckaroo Banzai twists his steering-wheel mounted TWIN ACCELERATORS, 
the sudden forward lurch of the Jet Car slamming him back against the 
headrest...

EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	34

THE JET CAR BLASTING OFF!  MORE FIRE!  MORE SMOKE!

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	35

Technicians and VIPS eye their monitors.

	36
AND SO DO WE:  the rugged JET CAR raising a cloud of dust, viewed from 
high above us it blasts ahead!

ANGLE ON	37

GENERAL CATBURD
Too bad war ain't Indianapolis.  It's fast, I'll give Banzai that.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Perhaps an idea whose time has come, General?  Scoot over.

Catburd moving aside as Senator Cunningham takes her turn with the 
viewing device.

GENERAL CATBURD
It'll never work.  It's too simple.

INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY	38

HIGH OVERHEAD, manned by a TV NEWS CREW.

	39
AN OVER-THE-CAMERAMAN'S SHOULDER POV as the JET CAR'S EXHAUST TRAIL 
CHOKES THE LANDSCAPE BELOW...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	40

BUCKAROO'S POV as the highway races underneath him...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	41

ALL EYES glued to those TV monitors, Rawhide and Reno 
watching...Perfect Tommy slapping his hand on the desk.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo 
able to keep that thing on the ground?

PERFECT TOMMY
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	42

Talk about a road hugger...the JET CAR SCREAMS PAST A BANK OF HIGH 
SPEED CAMERAS...THE EARTH SHAKING...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	43

PROF. HIKITA
Approaching thirty seconds downrange Three zero.  Course steady.  Speed 
three one seven nautical-four hundred...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
He's gonna do it!  The man is gonna do it!

GENERAL CATBURD
So what?  Big deal.  Anybody can drive fast in a straight line.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	44

...as if in response to Catburd's comment, Buckaroo does an amazing 
thing, NOW FLICKING HIS DIRECTIONAL SIGNAL...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	45

LEAVING THE PAVED SURFACE FOR OPEN TERRAIN!  BEGIN INTERCUTTING 
BLOCKHOUSE AND JET CAR...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	46

A FIRE breaking out on a dashboard gauge, Buckaroo quickly snuffing the 
SPARKS with his gloved hand...DANGER LIGHTS FLASHING!

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	47

...as AWESOME PHYSICAL PRESSURES take their tool on car and driver...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	48

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, do you read?

MISSION CONTROL
Advise you abort.  Over.  Repeat: advise abort.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	49

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's a big "no can do".

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE- DAY	50

Buckaroo's voice through STATIC AND CRACKLE.  Professor Hikita white-
knuckled...determined.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	51

Buckaroo STILL ACCELERATING, struggling with his mighty 
machine...fierce vibrations, OIL AND SMOKE filling the cockpit...as he 
wipes hot oil off his goggles...

INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY	52

In the NETWORK HELICOPTER, a NEWSMAN and CAMERMAN catch this shocking 
turn of events:

	53
THEIR POV OF...the JET CAR flaming along across the desert.  A SONIC 
BOOM!

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	54

A TV MONITOR...A HELICOPTER SHOT revealing that the course thus far 
traveled by Buckaroo is ON FIRE, the ground literally set ablaze by the 
incredible speed of his JET CAR:

ANGLE ON:	55

TV ANCHORWOMAN
The Jet Car off the road!  Radio contact with Mission Control here 
severed...that firestorm apparently interfering with 
communications...Buckaroo Banzai in serious trouble.

GENERAL CATBURD
Either that or he's popped his cookies.

Professor Hikita, on pins and needles, face taught, concerned.

MISSION CONTROL
Mach 1.  Buckaroo!  Do you read?  Commence braking procedure!  Over!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
He's heading for the goddamn mountains!

MISSION CONTROL
Eject, Buckaroo! EJECT!

Buckaroo heard faintly in a STORM OF NOISE...SPEAKING JAPANESE...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Professor Hikita, what'd he say?

PROF. HIKITA
(quizzical)
He said, "This Bud's for you, Professor."  What does that mean?

	56
ON THE MONITORS the JET CAR is seen heading directly into a box canyon 
and TOWARD A WALL OF MOUNTAINS, impact virtually assured.

ANGLE ON:	57

GENERAL CATBURD
Looks like Banzai's finally gonna get more than he bargained for.  And 
take the friends of the Earth with him.

Rawhide and Reno exchanging very concerned glances...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	58

Buckaroo Banzai peers out his thick glass window.

BUCKAROO'S POV:  THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN CLOSING FAST...	59

	60
ANGLE ON Buckaroo's hand moving to a switch on the dash marked

ANGLE ON:	66

MISSION CONTROL
It's off my scope!

GENERAL CATBURD
What the devil?  What is going on?!

INT.  JET CAR	67

BUCKAROO'S COCKPIT POV... like a roller coaster ride through a meteor 
shower - THE EIGHTH DIMENSION, AN ORGANIC ASTEROID HURTLING RIGHT AT US 
EMITTING STRANGE STATIC ELECTRICAL CHARGES...MONSTROUS...RED...GHASTLY!

	68
REVERSE ANGLE.  Looking directly at Buckaroo as his face distorts under 
God-knows-how-many G-forces...where the hell is he?!  His plexiglas 
visor shattering as if hit with a two-by-four.

COCKPIT POV...Buckaroo's windshield CRACKLING AND THE COCKPIT TURNING 
RED.	69

	70
CLOSE ON DASHBOARD: wildly spinning dials, Buckaroo punching the

The TV crew in their fancy helicopter first to witness an astounding 
sight.

	72
THEIR POV: the JET CAR EMERGING FROM SOLID ROCK AS THOUGH THE CRAGGY 
MOUNTAIN WERE MUSH!

CLOSE ON:	73

HELICOPTER NEWSMAN
(in apoplexy)
He's through it!  He's gone through the mountain without a scratch!  
Oh, my God!  Oh, my God in Heaven!

Fifty miles downrange, Buckaroo tries to slow the speeding, smoke-
filled JET CAR.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	76

A parachute popping out its back, at once ripping off in the high 
velocity wind...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	77

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Chute negative.  I'm gonna try and lay her sideways.

78	
ANOTHER ANGLE as he reaches for the hand brake and simultaneously spins 
his Brodi knob hard to the right!

EXT.  MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY	79

Buckaroo doing the impossible, somehow bringing the racing JET CAR to a 
spinning, skidding halt in a thicket of dry brush!  AS OVERHEAD THAT 
NETWORK HELICOPTER CIRCLES...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	80

The battered JET CAR, exhausting smoke, Buckaroo rolling its window 
down, opening the door and emerging, checking the damage to his 
vehicle, noting a STRANGE GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE on the cracked 
windshield, touching it and turning his nose from the smell...his glove 
steaming!

THE NEWS COPTER LANDING IN THE DISTANCE.	81

	82
ANGLE ON Buckaroo as he lowers himself under the Jet Car, coming face-
to-face with one ugly SPHERICAL PARASITE, THE THING SUDDENLY SHOOTING 
OUT at Buckaroo as he's about to touch it...A MOBILE PHONE starting to 
BEEP back in the cockpit...the PARASITE coming to rest on the 
ground...dead?

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	83

Pandemonium, people cheering...General Catburd on the phone...

GENERAL CATBURD
This his frequency?  Nobody's home.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	84

Buckaroo ignoring the phone, taking his lunch bag from the front seat 
and removing a sandwich, taking a bite of it, and using the foil to 
pick up the BIZARRE PARASITE from the desert floor...wrapping the weird 
thing up...now at last reaching for the car phone...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	85

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(Taking the phone)
Gimme that!  You tell me, Buckaroo, what in the hell is this going-
through-solid-matter-and rendering-all-conventional-defense-perimeters-
useless-over-night bullshit?

But now Professor Hikita snatching the phone from the Secretary, 
turning his back to the room!

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  Did you seem them?  Did you?

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	86

Buckaroo leaning in to check his gauges, talking on his telephone.  TWO 
FIGURES from the news copter approaching, still a hundred yards off...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast.  
Broke my windshield...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	87

PROF. HIKITA
(into phone)
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?

GENERAL CATBURD
Creatures?
(grabbing the phone)
Buckaroo, Catburd here.  I got egg all over my face, but that's okay.  
No room for egos here.  We're all Americans and I wanna buy that thing 
of yours.  What's it gonna run me?

PROF. HIKITA
Not for sale.

GENERAL CATBURD
I wasn't talking to you, Hikita san.

...as the Secretary of Defense picks up a RED PHONE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
This'll be the President of me?

Perfect Tommy and Reno suddenly stepping forward, intimidating 
Catburd...

PERFECT TOMMY
She's not for sale, right, General?

INT.  HOME FOR CRIMINALLY INSANCE - DAY	88

CLOSE ON the haunting, unsettling eyes of DOCTOR LIZARDO, AN ORANGE-
HAIRED OLD MAN watching NETWORK FOOTAGE of the Jet Car Test on his 
battered Philco TV set...his eyes practically burning a whole through 
the screen...

...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a room in an insane asylum, a room designed 
for several inmates but occupied by only one, this crazy old 
fiend...the empty beds piled with books and Italian memorabilia, the 
walls covered with mathematical equations...

	89
ANGLE ON Dr. Lizardo even now unable to resist scribbling another 
formula on the wall with a piece of chalk...

CLOSE ON PHILCO:	90

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Here she is, slowed down.  Lookit there...slam!  Right into the side of 
that mountain!  Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno, you guys're the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers. Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.  So I gotta ask, did 
it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the BJV, the 
experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently smack 
into a black void?

PERFECT TOMMY ON TV
Nope.

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Was Buckaroo acting different this morning, I mean, in terms of other 
mornings?

The Cavaliers rolling their eyes, looking at one another...

RAWHIDE ON TV
Well, we partied pretty late last night.

	91
BACK TO Dr. Lizardo now hearing footsteps outside in the corridor, and 
HIS LEFT AHND, ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS RIGHT, ERASES THE EQUATION 
HE'S JUST WRITTEN...as his right hand reaches under his pillow and 
picks up a crude HOMEMADE ELECTROMAGNET...a piece of metal wrapped in 
copper wire, one end of which is a small loop that Lizardo now attaches 
directly to his thumbs...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(muttering)
The Overthruster! The Overthruster! 

Lizardo looking back at his equation, at first puzzled to find it 
erased, then becoming angry.

	92
CLOSE ON HIS HAND NOW STICKING THE OTHER END OF HIS HOME-MADE DEVICE 
DIRECTLY INTO AN ELECTIRCAL SOCKET...

ANGLE ON:	93

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(obsessed)
The Overthruster! 

ELECTRICAL CURRENT COURSING THROUGH LIZARDO'S BODY...AN AURA 
SURROUNDING HIM AS HIS LIPS CURL INTO A HIDEOUS SMILE...BURNING THE 
SCREEN, TAKING US INTO AN ASTOUNDING FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:

INT.  STRANGE LABORATORY - NIGHT	94

Forty-six years prior (years before the ill-fated primitive speed car 
run involving Buckaroo's parents) an unlikely experiment in a strange 
factory...A RUNWAY...a much younger, dark-haired Doctor Lizardo being 
strapped into a homemade wicker chair/rocket sled by two LAB 
ASSISTANTS, the entire contraption set up like a catapult AIMED 
DIRECTLY AT A LOSID BRICK WALL, THROBBING ELECTROMAGNETS AND BANKS OF 
GLOWING OSCILLATORS...

	95
ANOTHER ANGLE...and peering into an unusual periscope, an equally 
JUVENILE PROFESSOR HIKITA wearing glasses and scraggly 
goatee...standing in front of a 1938 calendar on the wall, today's 
eagerly awaited date circled in red...

PROF. HIKITA
Almost ready, Dr. Lizardo...almost...

Doctor Lizardo pulling on a leather helmet, Professor Hikita nodding 
grimly at the LAB ASSISTANTS who tug on a GIANT LEVER...the 
ELECTROMAGNETS PULSATING...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
More!  More!

PROF. HIKITA
Not so fast...

	96
ANGLE ON Doctor Lizardo pulling a switch, UNLEASHING HIS WICKER CHAIR 
AT A FANTASTIC SPEED down the rails!

	97
AT THE END OF THE TRACK...the strange device coming to an abrupt and 
total stop ten feet from the brick wall, pitching Lizardo forward 
and...

...through the wall, at least partially, the seemingly solid bricks 
turning out to be more like vertical QUICKSAND...Lizardo half in, half 
out, physically unhurt but screaming his head off...

	99
...the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose, while 
Professor Hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope.

	100
PERISCOPE POV:  HUGE GROTESQUE RED CREATURES IN AN AURA OF ELECTRICITY 
TRYING TO PULL DOCTOR LIZARDO TOWARD THEM...ONE CREATURE IN PARTICULAR 
ENVELOPING LIZARDO!

	101
BACK TO...the doctor's assistants frantically tugging on his feet, 
dragging him back into the room only to find this SUDDENLY ORANGE-
HAIRED LIZARDO a fearsome, changed individual...a beast!

	102
CLOSE ON LIZARDO!  A terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he 
straightens up, at last wrenching free of the wicker chair, smashing 
his two assistants' heads together as he jumps over the runway!  Hikita 
watching wild-eyed as Lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy 
expanse of the factory...

	103
A DISTANT VIEW OF LIZARDO as he rips a door off its hinges, escaping 
into the night, SILHOUTTED AGAINST A DAZZLING SECURITY LIGHT, THE 
SCREEN BURNING WHITE...OUR FLASHBACK ENDING.

INT.  LIZARDO'S ROOM - NIGHT	104

Nearly half a century later, the elderly Lizardo regards with 
smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance 
of a GUARD who comes in and unplugs his TV set.

GUARD
Cheer up, Lizardo, it's Friday.  I come for your TV.  You been using 
too damn much juice...ten thousand kilowatts again this month.  Beats 
me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power.

The guard leaving with Lizardo's TV...Lizardo trying to control 
himself, his eyes rolling up at the ceiling where yet another UNUSUAL 
EQUATION has been scrawled in an angry hand.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
I want my TV...don't take my TV...I want it.  I want the Overthruster.  
I want it.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT	105

Mysterious half-light...CLOSEUPS...plugs and jacks...a portion of an 
upright base...drums with the BANZAI LOGO writ large...hands and feet 
putting everything together as an unseen audience stirs restlessly...

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT	106

Backstage in a small dressing room, the rock band known as the Hong 
Kong Cavaliers waits to go on...three unidentified GROUPIES in 
attendance as Rawhide naps and Reno tunes his saxophone while Perfect 
Tommy answers the questions of a FEMALE REPORTER from the local 
underground press...

Professor Hikita meantime at a corner table, studying his big notebook, 
examining a pair of KODAK SLIDES...

...as there is the sound of a commotion in the corridor, EXCITED VOICES 
and FOOT TRAFFIC coming this way, Rawhide methodically counting down 
under his Stetson:

RAWHIDE
Five...four...three...two...one.

	107
The door to the dressing room opening precisely on the count of one, 
admitting an out-of-breath and hastily tuxedoed Buckaroo Banzai, A 
SMALL CROWD OF ASSORTED FEMAL FANS locked outside.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm starving...somebody, help.

RAWHIDE
Got a half a tuna sandwich.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Same one you had yesterday?

Rawhide taking a half-eaten sandwich out of his hat and tossing it to 
Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Smells fermented.
(taking a big bite)
Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen 
you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.

RENO
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that 
crack in her windshield.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?

PERFECT TOMMY
Coming right up, Buckaroo.

Perfect Tommy producing a highly sophisticated SLIDE VIEWER...Buckaroo 
slipping in a transparency.

	108
HIS POV OF A COLORFUL PRISMATIC GRAPH over the backdrop of A NAKED 
WOMAN.

	109
Buckaroo immediately diagnosing the problem and removing the naked-
woman slide from the viewer...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Anybody we know?

PERFECT TOMMY
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?

Rawhide reclaiming his raunchy slide, Buckaroo looking back into the 
sleek device...

PROF. HIKITA
I ran it through the centrifuge, but I came up blank.  It's definitely 
dead now, although it still conducts electricity even better than 
copper does.

PERFECT TOMMY
Super performance organic material.

PROF. HIKITA
Yes, Perfect Tommy, in a way.  However...
(slipping in another slide)
...notice...although certain components resist identification, it 
corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(scrutinizing)
Too closely.  Gotta be more than sheer coincidence.  Rawhide, you're 
keen on bugs.  What do you think?

Rawhide takes a look as Reno hangs the phone up...

RENO
Everything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo.  Sam's with the Jet 
Car and she's under lock and key.  He's retiming her valves.

Buckaroo nodding, as he's interrupted by Perfect Tommy who's now 
brought over the female reporter...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not really.  This is pretty important.

PERFECT TOMMY
She wants a picture.

Perfect Tommy quickly taking a place beside Buckaroo, smiling into the 
camera, as Reno and Rawhide exchange disgusted looks...

	110
...the shutter clicking...another commotion in the hallway...the 
dressing room door opening to admit the club owner, ARTIE DUNCAN, a 
fifty-year-old rocker who has to struggle to close the door behind him 
on a herd of REPORTERS and FANS...

ARTIE DUNCAN
I don't care who you are...when you play my joint, you're just another 
band. I want some music outta you characters.

RENO 
You want it, Artie? You got it.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?

PERFECT TOMMY
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.

A pair of no-nonsense BLUE SHIELD IRREGULARS appearing to escort them 
on-stage...as Rawhide returns the spectroscope to Professor Hikita...

RAWHIDE
No question about it.  Something very akin to arachnoid tissue.  If I 
hadda guess?  A mutated species.

INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT	111

Buckaroo, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, and their two Blue Shield escorts 
hustling down a corridor.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB STAGE - NIGHT	112

Our boys arriving on stage...SHADOWY FORMS in the dramatically murky 
light...a FAMILIAR VOICE BOOMING OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM...

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery is proud to present, for one night 
only...the one, the only, the amazing Buckaroo Banzai and his Hong Kong 
Cavaliers!

LIGHTS UP!  AND A WAVE OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ROCK 'N' ROLL CRASHES OUT 
ON THE AUDIENCE, Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won't sit still!

	113
...while at the rear of the room, seated by herself, we find an 
ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY...crying, for some reason exempt from the general 
raucous good will.  She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do 
the job.  She's all alone.  She needs some help.  Her name is PENNY 
PRIDDY.

	114
On-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves 
the Cavaliers to cease as well.  EERIE STILLNESS, the only sound 
Buckaroo's lips on the silver mike.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I heard somebody crying.
(no response)
I said is someone out there crying in the darkness?

Yes, indeed...Penny's voice, weakly:	115

PENNY PRIDDY
Here...here at the back. I'm sorry...

	116
Buckaroo squints, spots her.  His voice comes mighty over the PUBLIC 
ADDRESS SYSTEM.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Raise your hand...where?

PENNY PRIDDY
(raising her hand)
This is so embarrassing...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's 
your name?

PENNY PRIDDY
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

For reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to 
Buckaroo and the Cavaliers as "Peggy," said name immediately eliciting 
a surprised reaction from the Cavaliers...

...Buckaroo amazed as well...a not-too-distant pain deep in his soul 
momentarily manifesting itself, although he makes a brave attempt at 
nonchalance...as now Penny is given that microphone.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you say..."Peggy"?

PENNY PRIDDY
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean 
anything to you.  I'm a nobody.

The business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing 
a bit more easily...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?

PENNY PRIDDY
(blowing her nose)
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 
69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my 
luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record 
producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for 
life, and like a fool, well, I...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
He offered you money?

PENNY PRIDDY
Do I look like that kinda girl?
(to tell the truth)
I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep 
tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still 
got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, 
I'll always have a job.

A few snickers...BUCKAROO shooting a disapproving look at those guilty 
of laughing at another person's misfortune...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Remember it's always darkest just before the dawn.  Believe me, I've 
been there.

Buckaroo moving to a piano...starting to play...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on 
your luck.

PENNY PRIDDY
(exasperated)
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?

	117
Buckaroo and his men start to SING ANOTHER TUNE...slower, sexier.

	118
...and Penny opens HER BIG CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE, removes first a dog-
earned paperback entitled Beyond the Realm of Atomic Particles and 
Massless Photons, by Buckaroo Banzai...then a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC 
BOOK, its cover depicting Buckaroo locked in mortal combat with HANOI 
SHAN, THE MANCHU TERROR!  Penny lays both publications on the table, 
continues to dig around, revealing next a SHINY SMALL-CALIBER AUTOMATIC 
PISTOL...

	119
ON STAGE...as Buckaroo pours it on, looking in her direction...	

	120
Penny takes the gun from her purse and lays it in her lap, tears 
starting to flood her eyes...

	121
BUCKAROO CROONING, all the women enraptured by his voice, his sultry 
glance, his animal presence...a real heart-breaker.

	122
Penny takes another drink, wraps her hand around the tiny pearl 
handle...SLOWLY MOVING THE GUN...

	123
ON STAGE, Buckaroo startled...	

	124
...as in the blink of an eye Penny ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT HERSELF, her arm 
accidentally deflected by a passing WAITRESS, the SHOT going harmlessly 
into the ceiling as...

	125
...the crack Hong Kong Cavaliers whip out their GUNS, snapping back 
hammers, forming a human barricade around Buckaroo...

	126
...while BLUE SHIELD SECURITY MEN materialize and drag Penny screaming 
from the room.

PENNY PRIDDY
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody okay up here?

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Arrest the girl!  Let's get this thing on the road, huh?

	127
The Cavaliers holstering their weapons, resuming musical 
postures...Buckaroo too...but his mind still half on Penny Priddy.

INT.  CRIMINALLY INSANCE COORIDOR - NIGHT	128

Recreation time.  SEVERAL MADMEN playing video games, content.

Doctor Lizardo's Philco TV now sitting on a watch desk, the guard who 
took it eating dinner, leaning back in his chair, his feet on the 
set...so he can bash it now and then to improve the picture 
quality...as a SHADOW falls across him...Doctor Lizardo...pulling a 
RATTY SUITCASE on tiny travel wheels, wearing an ANCIENT SPORTJACKET.  
Out for a stroll?

GUARD
Where do you think you're going, doc? The moon?

	129
An amazing thing occurring, as Lizardo's right arm rockets out an 
catches the astonished guard around the throat, lifting him off the 
floor, Lizardo's left hand picking up the telephone...

DR. LIZARDO
Operator! I wanna place a person-to-person call to John Bigboote, 
Yoyodyne Propulsions Systems.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Tell him it's 
John Whorfin calling. That's W-H-O-R-F-I-N. Got it, honey? John! J-O-H-
N!

Lizardo waiting for the call to go through as he strangles the last 
breath of air out of the helpless guard, drops him to the linoleum, 
reaching for the dead man's keys...

DR. LIZARDO
(into phone)
Of course it's me, John Bigboote, you fool! Prepare for my return!  The 
time has come.  Haven't you heard? Don't you watch TV? Banzai and 
Hikita have done it! I'll meet you at the factory.  Get that 
overthruster!  And the little Jap!  Alive!  Banzai's too dangerous.

Lizardo ripping the phone out of the wall, hurling it across the 
room...

...those inmates playing their video games fleeing like rabbits when 
they see that...Lizardo obviously no ordinary lunatic, as he proves by 
simply reaching out and...

	130
...touching THE BUCKAROO BANZAI VIDEO GAME, instantly shorting it out 
on his way to freedom, suitcase in tow.

INT.  BEDROOM ON BUS - DAY	131

CLOSE ON a newspaper, a banner front page headline announcing the 
amazing Jet Car test...

...and down in a lower corner, A PHOTOGRAPH OF "WOULD-BE-ASSASSIN" 
PENNY PRIDDY being summarily escorted out of Artie's Artery...PULLING 
BACK TO REVEAL...

	132
...a simple steel frame bed, fold-out desk with microscope, scientific 
books everywhere...Buckaroo trying to tie his bowtie, glancing at the 
newspaper propped upon his dresser, that picture of Penny Priddy 
staring back at him...Perfect Tommy and Reno nearby assembling some 
kind of slide show...THE WHOLE ROOM SWAYING MYSTERIOUSLY...

...the two Cavaliers worrying more about Buckaroo than about what 
they're doing, as they fumble the slides, several falling to the 
floor...

PERFECT TOMMY
Pick those up, Reno.

RENO
I didn't drop 'em.

...Perfect Tommy getting up and peeking at the newspaper over 
Buckaroo's shoulder...then returning to Reno...their voices low...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's a spittin' image.

RENO 
Doesn't look anything like her to me.

PERFECT TOMMY
Pictures don't lie.

RENO 
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks 
so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, 
right?

	133
Buckaroo overhearing all of this, of course, as the door opens, Rawhide 
appearing, offering a COMPUTER PRINT-OUT...

RAWHIDE
Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo. Thought you'd wanna be 
notified. That old pal of the professor's, Dr. Emilio Lizardo?  The one 
you did the brain scan on--?  He killed a guard last night, broke outta 
the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled 
it a block away.

Buckaroo's expression changing at the mention of the name 
Lizardo...taking the 
print-out.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Then what?

RAWHIDE
Vanished. Thin air.

PERFECT TOMMY
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?

RENO
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.

RAWHIDE
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath 
with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy 
brown like yours.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Have you warned Professor Hikita?

RAWHIDE
First thing I did.

PERFECT TOMMY
(in the dark)
Why?  What's going on?  Anything I oughta know?  C'mon, Rawhide, spill 
it.

Buckaroo nodding his permission...

RAWHIDE
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to 
discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before 
Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a 
rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half 
out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was 
orange...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.

RAWHIDE
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, 
got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away 
the key.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

Buckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his 
pocket.

RAWHIDE
And another thing.  Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without 
signing.

Buckaroo and Reno automatically turning to Perfect Tommy...

PERFECT TOMMY
Wasn't me.  I'd take a hundred, right?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	134

...the guys following Buckaroo into an amazing ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, 
like the rugged interior of an AWACS, dimly lighted instrument panels 
manned by two BLUE SHIELD TECHNICAL EXPERTS.

RADAR SHEILD ONE
Lookit this, Buckaroo.  Grossly abnormal high-altitude electrostatic 
disturbance over Connecticut.  Fallout from the Jet Car, you think?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Doubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.  Work 
her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then 
shovel the data over to Reno.

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - DAY	135

Buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door, and for the first 
time we realize that we just might be on a MOVING BUS...

EXT.  POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY	136

BUCKAROO'S BUS pulling up...BUCKAROO BANZAI AND THE HONG KONG CAVALIERS 
emblazoned along its side.

INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY	137

Waiting near the watch desk, Buckaroo's Jewish surgeon buddy, Dr. 
Zwibel...in a thousand-dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear, a 
Hoppalong Cassidy hat, red alligator boots, listening to the local 
COUNTRY STATION on a suitcase size stereo...

...looking up as Buckaroo, Reno, and Perfect Tommy approach...

DR. ZWIBEL
Howdy, Buckaroo.  Got your message about rendezvousing here.  Barely 
had time to pack my saddlebags.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Sid, welcome aboard.
(shaking hands)
Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel.  He'll be riding with us 
from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around.

Buckaroo heading over to the DESK SERGEANT on duty...

RENO
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Where do you hail from, Doc?

DR. ZWIBEL
(catching on)
New Jersey!

RENO NEVADA
Where's your spurs at?

DR. ZWIBEL
You making fun of me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus 
and introduce him to the rest of the hands.

RENO
Why me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.

Reno picking up Doctor Zwibel's huge stereo and suitcase...

RENO
Follow me, pard'ner.

INT.  CELL - DAY	138

Penny sitting on her bunk, a disheveled mess...depressed, her head 
buried in her hands as Buckaroo arrives.  She sees his reflection in 
the pitiful mirror above her toilet...

PENNY PRIDDY
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before 
any of this craziness.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go away.  Let me rot?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who were you really trying to kill last night?

PENNY PRIDDY
You.  Like the papers all say.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pretty terrible shot.

Silence.  Penny realizing you don't fool this man with the sloppy 
bowtie...coming over to the bars...

PENNY PRIDDY
Was she pretty?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who?

PENNY PRIDDY
The girl I remind you of.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.

PENNY PRIDDY
It's kinda hard this way.

Meaning fixing his tie...which she's trying to do...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.

PENNY PRIDDY
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?

PENNY PRIDDY
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, 
right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, I don't.

Penny taking too long to retie Buckaroo's tie...an excuse to be near 
him...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?

PENNY PRIDDY
Which?  The one in my throat.

Things really heating up between these two...Buckaroo changing the 
subject...blocking Perfect Tommy's view.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?

PENNY PRIDDY
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another 'you'?

PENNY PRIDDY
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I 
was adopted.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit 
me!

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with 
what you have...

Buckaroo touching her moist cheek, wiping away a tear.  Perfect Tommy 
and the Desk Sergeant exchanging looks...

PERFECT TOMMY
Running a little late, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let her out. In my custody.

PERFECT TOMMY
Let her out?  She's a killer.

Buckaroo and Penny unable to look away from each other.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No she's not. 

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON	139

REPORTERS, cameras, microphones, and a small audience of VIPS, civilian 
and military, in a large hotel conference room...eyes on the ticking 
clock...examining charts and MODELS OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES...on the 
dais, Professor Hikita, Secretary of Defense McKinley and Senator 
Cunningham, waiting for Buckaroo.

	140
Over the refreshment table set up for reporters, TWO REDHEADED MEN 
WEARING GLASSES practically FILL THEIR CUPS WITH CUBES OF SUGAR...one 
of their arms ELONGATING (1) for more sugar...THE STRANGE MOVE 
UNNOTICED...

	141
...as the crowd breaks into SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE and Buckaroo Banzai 
enter, Penny Priddy beside him...the glamorous couple surrounded by the 
Hong Kong Cavaliers.

	142
JOHN O'CONNOR, and JOHN GOMEZ, those two nearsighted REDHEADS with the 
sweet coffee applauding only politely.

	143
Buckaroo taking Penny onto the dais with him, the Cavaliers assuming 
positions of security as...

...Buckaroo sits next to Professor Hikita who shields his remarks from 
what must be easily FIFTY MICROPHONES...

PROF. HIKITA
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(nodding)
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, 
just in case.

Professor Hikita removing the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER from his 
battered briefcase and laying it on the table.  Buckaroo taking a sip 
of water...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Thank you for coming.  Before I answer any questions, I think Buckaroo 
owes us all a few explanations for yesterday's antics.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years 
ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all 
former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of 
Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane 
notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another 
planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid 
matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually 
glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with 
Doctor Emilio Lizardo.

1st REPORTER
The same Doctor Lizardo that just...?

PROF. HIKITA
One and the same.

	144
SOMEONE ELSE'S NEARSIGHTED POV, PEERING AT THE BACK OF PROFESSOR 
HIKITA'S HEAD THROUGH A CRACK IN THE CURTAINS BEHIND THE DAIS...

	145
John O'Connor and John Gomez at the refreshment table now adding 
several packs of 'Sweet 'n' Low' to their thick coffee as...

ON THE DAIS:	146

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm 
talking twister physics.  Quantum Mechanics.  Now you see, now you 
don't.  This table I'm sitting behind?  It appears to be solid matter, 
right?

Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping 
it, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces 
off the table...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons, 
quarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one 
quadrillionth of its total volume.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Exactly.  So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if 
solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover 
a to travel inside things like tables.  And mountains.

PROF. HIKITA
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating 
gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its 
electroweak forces!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, 
professor?

2nd REPORTER
What about the Pentagon?  The possibility of war in the Eighth 
Dimension, Mr. Secretary?

PENNY PRIDDY
Hey, better there than here, huh?

SOME APPLAUSE, the Secretary of Defense eyeing Penny critically as the 
lights dim...as RADAR SHIELD ONE slips into the room, approaches the 
dais, and the FIRST SLIDE is projected onto the screen...

	147
...the image a murky one...but the outline of a WARSHIP WITH U.S. 
SAILORS ABOARD nonetheless unmistakable...

CLOSE ON:	148

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(a whisper)
The President's calling you, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The president of what?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
The President of the United States.

	149
ANOTHER SLIDE, even more graphic, the number on the bow of the ship 
plainly visible...7541.

EVERYONE CAPTIVATED.	150

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is he still delirious?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(shrugging)
Can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him through to a pay phone down 
the hall.

PROF. HIKITA
In 1942, a U.S. Navy frigate, number 7541, disappeared on a clear day 
in the North Atlantic. Long thought to have been torpedoed, these 
pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the Eighth Dimension.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now wait a minute here...

PROF. HIKITA
Next transparency, please.

A loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector 
proves to be a remarkable image...

...of AN UPSIDE DOWN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIRATE VESSEL.	151

...Buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by Penny:	152

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo, don't forget your thruster.

...handing him the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER...Buckaroo declining it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You keep an eye on it.

PENNY PRIDDY
Any time. 

EXT.  OUTER SPACE - AFTERNOON	153

Meanwhile, several thousand miles overhead, a HUGE SPIKEY SPACECRAFT 
APPROACHES EARTH...

INT.  SPIKEY SPACECRAFT (FATHER SHIP) - AFTERNOON	154

A mysterious cloud room where BLACK BRRODING CREATURES perch upside 
down and sideways at controls in a smoky, vaporous environment, the 
only illumination EERIE YELLOW LIGHT...THE WALLS BREATHING.

BUCKAROO BANZAI'S VOICE
Mr. President--? You there?

MORE NOISES, THE SOUND OF TELEPHONE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT...

INT.  CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON	155

Back at a pay phone in the corridor, Buckaroo trying to figure out why 
the President doesn't answer. 

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus.  But they used the 
code.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. President--?  Some kind of interference...I can't...

Nothing from the other end except ODD SOUNDING COMPUTER BEEPS and the 
STATIC-LADEN VOICES of several operators...

RAWHIDE
Maybe it's just a prankster. Some computer whiz kid.

RENO
Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha Clearance.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to Radar Shield One)
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.

RAWHIDE
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this 
is on the level. We're busy people here.

	156
...when suddenly eerie, inexplicable things begin to occur...ALL HAVING 
TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY...the telephone book scooting closer to 
Buckaroo's fingers as if drawn by a magnet, the pages then turning, 
faster and faster...

	157
...Buckaroo amazed...now the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming 
shut, the phone simultaneously emitting a BIZARRE BUZZ...

	158
...and then Buckaroo gets literally the shock of his life...A MIGHTY 
ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE TELEPHONE...

...AND HURLING HIM OUT INTO THE COORIDOR!	159

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pencil!  Quick!  Pen!  Anything!

Reno complying, the lights returning to normal, Buckaroo dazed, his 
hand moving automatically, writing on any surface available.

A SPARK flying when he touches the metal-tipped pen to metal!	160

Buckaroo finally settling for his hand, SCRIBBLING NUMBERS ON HIS PALM.
	161

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON	162

PROF. HIKITA
Let me ask you to imagine the Oscillation Overthruster as a 
sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a steady stream of protons at a 
target-in this case a mountain-and the Jet Car as a giant super-
conducting magnet.

The Secretary of Defense fascinated.	163

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Sure, sure, but what about the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh 
Dimensions?

PENNY PRIDDY
(thumbing through her paperback)
I don't guess they matter.  It's like cheesecloth, I think.  Minkowiski 
space...

...as all eyes turn to see a still woozy Buckaroo Banzai returning, 
pointing dramatically at John Gomez and John O'Connor in the 
audience...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There!  Those two!  Don't panic...

The Cavaliers haven't a clue what he's talking about...

RENO
Whadda you mean, Buckaroo?  Where?  What?

	164
BUCKAROO'S POV...SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY...ACROSS THE ROOM, TWO GHASTLY 
ALIENS, GIANT RED ARACHTOIDS WEARING SUITS AND TIES, HOLDING COFFEE 
CUPS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Evil...pure and simple, from the eighth dimension! Grab 'em!

	165
RENO'S POV...NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY...neither Reno nor anyone else 
in the room seeing what Buckaroo does, seeing instead only those two 
redheaded gents who like their coffee sweet, John O'Connor and John 
Gomez...COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE THE CRIMSON CREATURES BUCKAROO THINKS 
ARE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids! Stop 'em!

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Arachtoids?

	166
Buckaroo breaking into a dead run across the room, those two astonished 
RED ALIENS racing for the nearest exit!

	167
The Hong Kong Cavaliers rushing to help Buckaroo when suddenly the 
PIERCING SCREAM of Penny Priddy causes them to stop in their tracks and 
look toward the dais...

...where yet NOTHER REDHEAD called JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, in glasses and dark 
suit, a bandanna over his face, has just stepped from behind the 
curtain and seized Professor Hikita, pointing a revolver at the old 
man's head...the Cavaliers instinctively stepping toward the dais, 
outraged...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Okay, wise guys! 

...the masked John Bigbooté FIRING once, wounding Reno in the 
shoulder...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Let those gun belts hit the floor! And nobody follows, or the prof is 
history! 

The pistol stuck in Professor Hikita's ear convincing the Cavaliers to 
obey, to watch helplessly as the kidnapper backs his victim through the 
curtain and out of sight...as new Jersey administers first aid to Reno 
and Penny strokes the fallen Cavalier's hair, berating the idle 
bystanders around them:

PENNY PRIDDY
Is this the kind of society you want?  A society of weak-kneed 
jellyfish wallowing in self-pity, prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us 
off like flies?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Or a society where we stand strong, take charge of our own destiny, 
with the cry "So far and no farther will we be pushed!"

INT.  HOTEL BOWELS - MOVING - AFTERNOON	168

Buckaroo in the meantime running down a flight of stairs...catching 
sight of his prey...THOSE TWO MONSTROUS RED ALIENS running through a 
swinging door...

...Buckaroo accelerating, hitting the door with every ounce of strength 
in him...

INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON	169

...Buckaroo flying through the door, taking a fall down concrete steps, 
finding himself in the hotel parking garage where a MOTORCYCLE SHOW is 
unloading equipment...

...Buckaroo spotting THREE SHADOWY FORMS halfway across the lot loading 
A LARGE CRATE into a van...

Buckaroo wasting no time going after the van, as it starts 
up...commandeering A FANCY NEW MOTORCYCLE, charging after the van 
despite an EXHIBITOR'S warning:

EXHIBITOR
Hey, you can't ride that! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON	170

The Cavaliers coming from two directions, colliding at an 
intersection...

PERFECT TOMMY
Any sign of Buckaroo?

RENO
No!  Ditto the professor-

RAWHIDE
Shit!

EXT.  CITY STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON	171

The van speeds by...the motorcycle pursues!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON	172

The chase continues, leaving the city behind...

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - LATER AFTERNOON	173

...the van coming straight toward us, thundering past...as Buckaroo and 
his motorcycle next roar INTO CAMERA in hot pursuit, and over his 
shoulder an AWESOME SIGHT...

...A DARK, UNNERVINGLY PREHISTORIC CREATURE FLYING DIRECTLY AT US, 
GROWING LARGER AND LARGER ON THE SCREEN, BUCKAROO UNAWARE OF ITS 
EXISTENCE...

EXT.  FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON	174

Twilight enveloping a New Jersey meadow as a pair of DUCK HUNTERS and 
their DOG takes advantage of the last half hour of fading daylight 
as...

...that BLACK CREATURE wings overhead!	175

	176
The duck hunters confused, frightened, FIRING, as a reflex reaction to 
this sudden threat from above!

	177
CLOSE ON the AWFUL BLACK CREATURE HIT, swooping low with a horrible 
shudder!

The hunters transfixed...	178

DUCK HUNTERS
My God!  What the hell...

The FRIGHTFUL sound of the CREATURE'S FAILING LUNGS...a terrific noise 
as the duck hunters hurry to where their unnatural kill hangs obscured 
in a gigantic tree...their dog running ahead, intent on retrieving this 
unusual "BIRD"...

EXT.  TREE - LATE AFTERNOON	179

The heavy-footed hunters SLOSHING THROUGH WATER, the first hunter to 
arrive on the scene using a sharp stick to poke at a BULGING BLADDER on 
the bottom of the strange creature, the sac bursting and drenching the 
hunter with a hideous viscous fluid...SPARKS!  AND A STRANGE BLUE 
DUST...

	180
...as suddenly AN ENORMOUS SPHERE drops out of the tree and begins 
rolling toward the hunter who poked that sac...

DUCK HUNTERS
Jesus Christ--!  What is it?

The other hunter following the ODD SPERE as it backs his buddy into a 
shallow swamp...the thing coming to a stop and...

	181
...A BLACK MAN with dreadlocks emerging from the top of the weird 
vessel, trying to balance himself when he slips and crashes to the 
ground, his neck breaking...a beam from his dropped 'flashlight' 
revealing him in death to be not a black man, but a BLACK ALIEN WITH A 
THREE-FINGERED HAND...

	182
...the hunters terrified as their dog starts snarling at the tree where 
now a second BLACK MAN has emerged, running for the road, jumping the 
fence like a gazelle...

	183
...the hunters not seeing this second individual, obsessed instead with 
a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK they've discovered in the dead alien's 
fingers.

1ST HUNTER
It's the latest issue!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - TWILIGHT	184

Buckaroo still on his MOTORCYCLE in pursuit of the van, taking a daring 
shortcut down a treacherous hillside...

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	185

Alien John Bigbooté at the wheel, alien John Gomez riding shotgun, in 
high spirits, cradling a DRY CELL BATTERY, his strange tongue upon it, 
getting high...his teeth glowing.

Bigbooté turning in his seat, overhearing alien John O'Connor operating 
a RADIO in the rear of the speeding van...

JOHN O'CONNOR
What? A black ship?  Where?
(listening)
A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?

John Bigbooté looking at John Gomez for any possible explanation.

JOHN GOMEZ
John Whorfin...maybe they know he's escaped!

JOHN O'CONNER
How?  How could they possibly know?  They're more than three trillion 
six hundred sixty million miles away.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
(jerking the wheel)
They know everything!  I told Whorfin to sit tight.  This could be the 
end of us all!  We gotta get Banzai's Overthruster and get off this 
rock!

EXT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	186

The van making a 180( turn!

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	187

John Bigbooté yelling back to John O'Connor:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?

JOHN O'CONNOR
I have a radio fix...

John Gomez opening the glove compartment, taking out a pistol:

JOHN GOMEZ
Death to the enemy!

JOHN O'CONNOR
Death to the enemy--!  Kill or die!

John Bigbooté just driving...his strange eyes set.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	188

Buckaroo rounding a curve on his motorcycle when that van is suddenly 
upon him, coming head on!

Buckaroo just having a split-second to catch the logo 'Yoyodyne' on the 
front of the van as he swerves into a ditch to avoid certain death...

	189
...Buckaroo quickly restarting the motorcycle and taking out A SWISS 
ARMY LIGHTER/MINIATURE TWO-WAY RADIO, making a call to:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide.  Come in.  Over.

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	190

Back in the press conference room, the anxious Cavaliers try to help 
several LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPES reconstruct the professor's kidnapping.  
A TINY BUZZER going off in Rawhide's pocket:  his SWISS ARMY CIGARETTE 
LIGHTER.  Rawhide turns his Back on everyone, taking out a pack of 
Luckies, lighting up as he talks quietly into the FLAME:

RAWHIDE
Over, Buckaroo.  What's up?  Where in Hades are you?  I'm getting a 
lotta static.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	191

Buckaroo pushing and shoving his motorcycle onto a woodland path...IT 
IS GETTING QUITE DARK...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the 
homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.

RAWHIDE
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The deuce you say.
(realizing)
That crate!

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	192

Elsewhere in the room, nervous and concerned, Penny Priddy sits apart 
from the others, thumping the keys of a piano...

RAWHIDE
What crate?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and 
dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.

RAWHIDE
(into flame)
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?

...Reno sitting down next to Penny at the piano, his wounded arm in a 
sling but his fingers nimble as ever...

PENNY PRIDDY
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?

RENO
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.

PENNY PRIDDY
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?

RENO
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted 
some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.

PENNY PRIDDY
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?

RENO
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.

Rawhide calling from across the room...

RAWHIDE
All right.  Let's go!  We got our work cut out for us tonight!

Reno getting up, Penny unsure at that moment whether she's being 
included, as those steely eyes of Rawhide zero in on her...

RAWHIDE
You, too, Miss Penny.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT	193

Darkness as Buckaroo races on, the taillights of the van far ahead...

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	194

John Gomez now sharing his DRY CELL BATTERY with John O'Connor, the two 
of them singing a SONG from their home planet...

...John Bigbooté at the wheel, preoccupied, refusing their offer of a 
toke on the battery with:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No thanks, I'm driving.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	195

The Yoyodyne van approaching the scene of the downed spacecraft, the 
headlights of the single HIGHWAY PATROL CAR illuminating the CORPSE OF 
THE DEAD CREATURE in the water...the HIGHWAY PATROLMAN pulling the 
figure out of the water, the hunters standing by...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Hand me that tarp. Let's cover this guy...

2ND HUNTER
What guy? He's got paws.

The other hunter tossing a plastic tarp over the body as they all turn 
to regard the headlights of the Yoyodyne van...the cop heading that 
way...

	196
BUCKAROO ARRIVING now too, scraping to a stop on his motorcycle in 
heavy brush, creeping closer to the crash site for a better look...

	197
BUCKAROO'S POV: The ungainly SPHERICAL SPACECRAFT and that amazing DEAD 
CREATURE on the ground, covered now with a sheet of semi-transparent 
plastic...observing John Bigbooté and John Gomez producing official 
I.D.s and appearing to BUCKAROO AS CRIMSON ALIENS...TO THE COPS AS...

ORDINARY CITIZENS:	198

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Bigbooté, Officer. Executive Vice President, Yoyodyne Propulsion 
Systems.

JOHN GOMEZ
(of the spacecraft)
One of our birds.

The highway patrolman returning Bigbooté's I.D., still a little 
skeptical about the whole thing, pointing to THE DEAD CREATURE UNDER 
PLASTIC.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That fella over there-that one of yours, too, is it?

John Bigbooté having a ready answer...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
The droid, you mean?

	199
Buckaroo moving quickly to the back of the van, starting to open the 
rear door with a locksmith's pick attached to his special SWISS ARMY 
LIGHTER.

ELECTRICITY JUMPING FROM HIS FINGERS.	200

Buckaroo dropping the two-way radio homing device on the bumper...
	201

INT.  VAN - CRASH SITE - NIGHT	202

The sound of the Swiss Army lighter jolting red alien John 
O'Connor...O'Connor thinking the noise has come from the crate 
itself...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Button up in there, Professor, if you know what's good for you.

John O'Connor stepping out for a smoke.

EXT.  VAN - NIGHT	203

Buckaroo watching the alien John O'Connor move off in the direction of 
the hunters, retrieving his dropped Swiss Army lighter, not noticing 
that the once blinking L.E.D. on the homing device has gone out!  
Buckaroo again picking the lock...

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	204

...ordinary citizen John O'Connor meanwhile observing the hunters still 
hanging around, one of them engrossed in the Buckaroo comic, his pal 
trying to figure out how to operate the dead alien's unusual 
flashlight...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Nice night, huh?

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	205

...as Buckaroo stealthily enters, working the lock on the crate now 
with his all-purpose lighter.

CLOSE ON HIS FINGERS EMITTING THE OCCASIONAL SPARK...	206

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT	207

John Bigbooté, John Gomez, and the cop looming above the dead 
creature...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Looks like nothing I ever seen. I seen droids in space movies, but 
they're nothing like this-

JOHN GOMEZ
It's a three-man thermopod...

John Bigbooté shooting John Gomez a hard stare...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Thermopod?  What's a...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Very T.S.  Top Secret, right John Gomez?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Yeah, well, I was gonna call Buckaroo Banzai out here to have a look.  
Right up his alley, I think.

John Bigbooté's mood suddenly changing...tensing...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
You called Buckaroo Banzai?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Not yet.  I said I was gonna.

The three of them looking up at another pair of headlights arriving, A 
SEDAN, the cop yelling at them:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Go on!  Keep it moving!

JOHN GOMEZ
We got a truck on the way to mop things up for you.  Else this place 
could become a zoo, not to mention a haven for gawkers.

The highway patrolman moving off to deal with the sedan...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
We'll just go ahead and start breaking it down.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Don't touch it!  I got my own help on the way!  That's an order!

John Bigbooté frowning, telling John Gomez:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
There's a crowbar in the truck.

John Gomez nodding, heading back to the van...

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	208

...as Buckaroo pries his way into the crate, extracting the shaken 
Professor Hikita.

A SPARK dancing between them as they touch!	209

	210
PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than 
flapjacks.

PROF. HIKITA
What?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us.  
Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...

Buckaroo trying to show Professor Hikita the MATHEMATICAL FORMULA 
written on his hand.

PROF. HIKITA
You can see them? 

Buckaroo holding a finger to his lips...whispering...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. 
What is it?

PROF. HIKITA
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me 
scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.

Buckaroo opening the door to the van.

BUCKAROO SEES the red alien John Gomez coming closer...	211

	212
PROF. HIKITA
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.

PROF. HIKITA
Planet 10?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(pointing quickly)
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and 
start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions.  
Just synthesize it-

The professor still without the crucial information, however...John 
Gomez approaching...

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, the formula--

Thinking fast, Buckaroo presses the palm of his hand to Professor 
Hikita's forehead, the ball-point ink transferring...THE IMPORTANT 
FORMULA IMPRINTED IN REVERSE ON THE PROFESSOR'S SHINY PATE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Hurry!  Please.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT	213

The highway patrolman talking to the sedan...TWO SHADOWY FIGURES 
INSIDE...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
If you're gonna stay, you're gonna be under arrest.  It's your choice.

INT.  WOLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	214

Meanwhile back on Buckaroo's bus, in the nerve center, Rawhide and 
Perfect Tommy look at a BLANK OSCILLOSCOPE operated by a Blue Shield 
Technician...

PERFECT TOMMY
Twelve minutes since the last signal. Long time.

RAWHIDE
Too long.  We better get somebody over there.  Put up the grid, last 
known location--

	215
CLOSE ON OSCILLOSCOPE...AN ELECTRONIC GRID FIELD coming up, noting 
Buckaroo's last location.

	216
RAWHIDE
Hop on the Marconi, see if we got any Blue Shields within a ten-minute 
radius.

PERFECT TOMMY
Done.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	217

Buckaroo moving dangerously closer to the thermopod as the alien John 
Gomez returns with the crowbar...his other-worldly comrade demanding:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Open it!

SEDAN SITTING TIGHT.

INT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT	219

Inside an all-night gas station somewhere in New Jersey, a young black 
kid named SCOOTER LINDLEY at his SPECIAL HAM RADIO SET, hearing:

PERFECT TOMMY'S VOICE
Repeat: Intrastate Outward Band 5...Coded...calling all Blue Shield 
Irregulars in the Clam State.  Bucakroo in trouble...will repeat 
coordinates...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
This is Scooter Lindley, Future Knight of the Blue Shield 411/2. Hang 
on!

EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT	220

Scooter racing outside toward his father, CASPER LINDLEY, the station 
owner, an everyday no-nonsense guy in grungy overalls, presently trying 
to sell a crushed velvet sofa from the top of a three-tier display rack 
to a PAIR OF DISCRIMINATING CUSTOMERS...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Dad! Dad! Buckaroo's in trouble!

CASPER LINDLEY
Say what?!

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT	221

A weary, worried Rawhide comes back into the front of the bus and takes 
a seat near Penny and Reno...

NEW JERSEY
Trouble?

RAWHIDE
Nah-Damn sophisticated equipment always breaking down.

Reno wondering if there's more to it than Rawhide's saying...Rawhide 
losing himself in a copy of American Horseman.

Penny leaning forward, thinking, picking at a guitar left on the seat 
in front of her, watching the mysterious Hong Kong Cavaliers.

	222
Perfect Tommy arriving, whispering something in Rawhide's ear, Rawhide 
nodding...

Penny looking over at Perfect Tommy across the aisle, Perfect Tommy 
confiscating the guitar...his guitar.

PENNY PRIDDY
What's his problem?

RENO
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that 
thing?

PENNY PRIDDY
Better than him.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	223

Buckaroo jockeying for an improved position, as the alien John Gomez 
prepares to strike the pod-TWO MEN getting out of the sedan 
now...ARACHTOIDS in baggy suits...

...THE CROWBAR HITTING THE POD for the first time!

	224
The cop turning, shouting at John Gomez from his squad car:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Whadda you think you're doing?  Hey!

The cop in a jam, heading back toward the pod, as the two newly arrived 
redheads follow him despite his instructions:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
I said back off!  I mean it.  Now get in your car and get the hell 
outta here!

...the two goons halting...but as soon as the cop turns, they follow 
him again...

EXT.  FRONT GATES/BANZAI INSTITUTE - NIGHT	225

A modest estate, several unique buildings on several acres of rolling 
Midlothian grassland, home of Buckaroo Banzai and the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers...that famous Double B logo festooning a large front gate...a 
sign: THE BANZAI INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND STRATEGIC 
INFORMATION.

	226
...A NUMBER OF BUCKAROO'S DEVOTED FANS perpetually outside with 
sleeping bags and cameras...a wave of excitement rippling through the 
crowd as BUCKAROO'S DOUBLE BUS approaches and THREE BLUE SHIELDS on 
guard begin opening the gate.

INT.  FOYER/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	227

A combination Japanese ryokan-American ranch house, an elegant 
reflection of Buckaroo's dual lineage...a teenage girl heading for the 
door to answer an insistent buzzer...she MRS. JOHNSON...

	228
...Penny and the Hong Kong Cavaliers standing outside...Mrs. Johnson 
reacting as if she's seen a ghost...

MRS. JOHNSON
Peggy--!?  Oh, wow...no...

RENO
She's not Peggy, Mrs. Johnson--

MRS. JOHNSON
Not Peggy--!  Of course not. How could she be, huh?  Whew.

RAWHIDE
Any word from Buckaroo?

MRS. JOHNSON
No...I thought he was with you guys...

The Cavaliers quickly dispersing...Penny left alone under Mrs. 
Johnson's curious eyes...

INT.  STUDIO-COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	229

...the Cavaliers stepping into a home studio, a tangle of wires and 
microphones, mixing consoles and data banks tended by a skeleton crew 
of BLUE SHIELD TECHNICIANS...one a brainy, wiry kid in his late teens.

BRAINY KID
Hi, fellas...gonna lay down some background vocals tonight?

RAWHIDE
Wish life was so simple, Billy.  Remember that outfit the Justice 
Department checked into last year-Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?

BRAINY KID (BILLY)
The big space and weapons high tech consortium way behind on their 
delivery of the controversial new Truncheon Bomber?

PERFECT TOMMY
You got her.  Buckaroo's orders: access their data bank.  Attack their 
systems.  Up to it?

BILLY
I'm a little short-handed tonight.  My phone phreaks went into town for 
the big ice cream social...

NEW JERSEY
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!

BILLY
Who're you?

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	230

JOHN GANT
Detonator set.  My most profuse apologies to my homeland and loved 
ones.  John Valuk is dead.  He fell on his head, but perhaps John 
Parker will get through!

The screen going dark.

	235
THE ARACHTOID WING COMMANDER exchanging words with his second-in-
command...

SECOND-IN-COMMAND
But what if John Parker too is dead?  Then we must send another 
thermopod at once to contact Buckaroo Banzai!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
There's no time.  We have our order from John Emdall.

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	236

The alien John O'Connor looking in on the crate...finding it 
empty...lid off...

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	237

Ordinary citizen John Gomez HITTING the little thermopod again, the cop 
exasperated, pushed to the brink, surrounded...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That's it, gentlemen, you're all under...

The cop reaches for his pistol when suddenly John Bigbooté whirls and 
lunges out with HIS TELESCOPING ARM, chopping the cop's Adam's apple, 
knocking him to the ground...

...the hunters stunned, one of them reaching for a shotgun when the two 
newly-arrived Yoyodyne goons attack, easily knocking the hunters to the 
ground, beating them!

	238
Bucakroo starting forward, but A THREE-DIGIT HAND suddenly on his 
shoulder!  Spinning him around!

VOICE
Easy, friend-

Buckaroo face-to-face with RED ARACHTOID John O'Connor, the latter 
surprised to discover it's...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Buckaroo Banzai--!

Buckaroo taking advantage of this creature's momentary amazement to 
kick O'Connor below the belt...dropping him to the turf...now spying 
yet another set of headlights coming down the road...

JOHN O'CONNOR
(in pain)
It's Buckaroo Banzai! Get him! He let the professor outta the box!

	239
The goons pursuing Buckaroo onto the road, the HEADLIGHTS OF A TRUCK 
bearing down on them...Buckaroo waving back at the truck, his only 
chance, when suddenly, instead of slowing, the truck speeds up, trying 
to run him over...YOYODYNE!

...Buckaroo lunging to safety at the last minute, getting up and 
running into a field...the Yoyodyne truck making a 180( turn and coming 
after him, across the meadow.

	240
...Buckaroo pursued by the truck and the goons when suddenly THE BLACK 
THERMOPOD EXPLODES, Buckaroo and the goons flying to the ground, 
Buckaroo quickly up and running, the truck gaining on 
him...gaining...still gaining when out of nowhere, A ROPE LADDER falls 
from the sky, entangling Buckaroo and pulling him up to a hovering 
HELICOPER...

INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT	241

Piloting the small chopper, Casper Lindley, gas station proprietor, 
along with his eager son, Scooter...both father and son dressed in Blue 
Shield outfits now...Casper giving Buckaroo a helping hand into the 
swift-flying craft and getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK, COMING THIS 
CLOSE TO DROPPING BUCKAROO!

CASPER LINDLEY
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the 
Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty 
tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll 
be worried.

Buckaroo reaching for the mike, relieved to feel only a SLIGHT 
ELECTRICAL CHARGE on touching it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not the famous Scooter....?

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow.  You know it.

EXT.  FRONT GATES/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	242

Professor Hikita on motorcycle, being waved through the front gate by a 
BLUE SHIELD GUARD while a second Shield, PINKY CARRUTHERS (on 
HORSEBACK), telephones ahead...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
The prof just rolled in.  Says he's on his way to the lab and "Do not 
disturb."

INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	243

Reno on the phone, getting the word on Hikita while the other Cavaliers 
watch Billy call up a strange senseless MAZE OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS on 
his monitor...

RAWHIDE
Try a new cipher.  Try G.

BILLY 
G cipher. There!  More like it!

NEW JERSEY
Nice work, kid.

	244
CLOSE UP SCREEN:  the letters having at least turned into something 
coherent...a batch of names and dates, vital statistics...headed 
"YOYODYNE."

	245
BILLY
Looks like we've accessed their Read Only Memory...a personnel file. 
Could be highly revealing.

RENO
(rejoining the group)
The professor just pulled in, jabbering something about space monsters, 
locked himself in his lab.

PERFECT TOMMY
"Space monsters"...my ass.

INT.  HALLWAY/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	246

Mrs. Johnson leading Penny down a richly paneled corridor past pictures 
and momentoes of Buckaroo and the Cavaliers, past and present...

MRS. JOHNSON
I'm sure the boys like you.  They just don't wanna get attached...and 
then see what happened to Buckaroo's last sweetheart happen to you.

PENNY PRIDDY
What happened to her?

Mrs. Johnson biting her tongue...

MRS. JOHNSON
You know any judo?

PENNY PRIDDY
Any what?

MRS. JOHNSON
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

Penny staring at this strange young girl, not knowing what to say...

PENNY PRIDDY
What's up those stairs?

MRS. JOHNSON
Bunkhouse.  Off limits.  You'll be bedding down in here.

...Mrs. Johnson opening a guest room door...Penny eyeing those 
forbidden stairs...

INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	247

BILLY
This is queer...look...

Billy staring intently at the monitor...the others leaning in...

	248
CLOSE ON MONITOR:  a list of IDENTICAL DATES AND PLACES NEXT TO A RAFT 
OF NAMES.

	249
BILLY
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New 
Jersey on the exact same date.

NEW JERSEY
New Jersey?

BILLY
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.

RAWHIDE
Grover's Mills, Grovers' Mills...1938.  Why's that so darn familiar?

RENO
Looks like none of these guys ever lived anywhere else.  No places of 
birth.  And all of them with the same first name: John.

New Jersey studying the screen...

NEW JERSEY
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and 
November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. 
October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it? 
(obviously not)
Orson Welles!

BILLY 
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?

NEW JERSEY
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast 
that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were 
landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out 
to be a hoax.

BILLY
Then that's it!

RENO
What's it?

NEW JERSEY
Right!  Hoax my eye!

RENO
You mean--?  No!

BILLY
Yes!  Martians!  Right across the river in Grover's Mills!

EXT.  FRONT GATES/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	250

Pinky Carruthers aboard his palomino as JOHN PARKER (the only alien to 
escape the black thermopod) rides up outside the gate on a 
bicycle...holding a STRANGE YELLOW RECORD in his grasp...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
Hi, buddy, what can I do for ya?

JOHN PARKER
Buckaroo Banzai?

PINKY CARRUTHERS
You a messenger? What've you got here?

Pinky Carruthers snatching the ODD YELLOW RECORD through the gate...

JOHN PARKER
I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person. My name is John Parker. Identify 
yourself.

PINKY CARRUTHERS
Knight Commander, Pinky Carruthers. Sorry, John, all these people "need 
see" Buckaroo in person.

And with that Pinky Carruthers is gone, trotting up toward the mansion 
on his palomino...

...as a frustrated John Parker suddenly sticks his nose in the air, 
getting a whiff of something, causing him to get on his bike and 
pedal...

EXT.  OUTSIDE SECURITY WALL - NIGHT	251

...around the corner of Buckaroo's estate where he notices a PARKED VAN 
and THREE SHADOWY FIGURES lowering themselves into the ground near the 
high security wall...disappearing...

...John Parker approaching, beholding...that familiar "Yoyodyne" 
van...and a FRESHLY DUG HOLE, crawling into the hold himself.

EXT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE GROUNDS - NIGHT	252

...surfacing WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE ESTATE and again catching sight of 
THE SHADOWY FIGURES moving toward the buildings, John Parker 
following...quickly ducking behind a tree, trying to get himself a good 
view of the three intruders...

SUDDEN VOICE
That's as far as you go, pal.

John Parker jerking his head around, finding himself confronting the 
FRIGHTENING SILHOUETTE of a Blue Shield in camouflage commando gear...

	253
...John Parker instinctively raising a hand to protect himself when 
without warning, a second BLUE SHIELD drops on his head from the tree 
above, knocking him down...

INT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	254

Closed...SAM, the mechanic, next to Buckaroo's precious JET CAR, 
tinkering with that damaged Harley Davidson...the garage door suddenly 
sliding open, startling Sam...no one there.

SAM
Okay, who's the funny guy?

EXT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	255

In the buses, CLOSE ON SOMETHING WEIRD EMERGING SLOWLY FROM TEH ALIEN 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ'S MOUTH...SHARP...

Sam stepping forward...A FIVE-PRONGED ORGANIC STINGER THE SIZE OF A 
WALNUT FLYING OUT OF THE NIGHT!  A scream dying in Sam's throat as he 
clutches his heart, John Bigbooté dragging him back into the garage.

INT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	256

...while the red alien John Gomez remains outside as a lookout, the 
alien John O'Connor quickly peering into the locked Jet Car and 
smashing the window, searching in vain for the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Not here!  No Overthruster!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Whorfin will kill us!

JOHN O'CONNOR
You look!  It's not here!

JOHN GOMEZ
Professor Hikita!

EXT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	257

Outside, John Gomez making a startling discovery: the figure of 
Professor Hikita near an upstairs window of the research building only 
yards away...when suddenly overhead...

	258
GOMEZ'S POV...CASPER LINDLEY'S CHOPPER...landing behind a stand of 
trees as the alien intruders scatter for cover.

INT.  DEN - NIGHT	259

Mrs. Johnson sitting near a crackling fire, at a small desk stacked 
high with books and papers, her nose in an advanced chemical 
engineering text.

...looking up as the front door opens, admitting Buckaroo Banzai, 
Casper and Scooter bringing up the rear...

MRS. JOHNSON
Buckaroo!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is the professor here? Where's Penny?

MRS. JOHNSON
Both of 'em safe and sound. What's going on?  Everybody's freakin' out.

A shaken Rawhide, Reno, Perfect Tommy appearing on the stairway...

RENO 
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What? How do you know that?

RAWHIDE
It's all on the record. Come on-

Buckaroo heading up the stairs...

	260
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY...BUCKAROO MOVING QUICKLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR with his 
men, being debriefed on the run:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect 
Tommy?  The invisible body?

PERFECT TOMMY
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 
at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

RENO
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and 
they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?

PERFECT TOMMY
Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing 
around with his own stupid Overthruster.

RAWHIDE
Faulty design.  It sucked.

RENO
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep 
that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension 
when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind 
snapped?  Of course!  What else?

PERFECT TOMMY
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to 
talk to the head honcho.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It?  Who does?

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	261

Professor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at...

	262
...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce 
TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES...

	263
...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON 
HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	264

...while Billy places John Parker's UNUSUAL YELLOW RECORD on a 
turntable in Buckaroo's cluttered office...Casper and Scooter and the 
Cavaliers seeking protection behind a PLEXIGLAS 'BLACKBOARD', their 
faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations...

	265
...Buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer, FASCINATED TO SEE HE 
STILL POSSESSES ENOUGH STATIC ELECTRICITY IN HIS HAND TO DRAW A SHEET 
OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET!

RENO 
Stand back, man...

	266
...as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry 
of SMOKE AND SPARKS, A GORGEOUS BLACK HUMAN FEMAL sizzles up from the 
grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air...A HOLOGRAM!

HOLOGRAM
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Emdall from Planet 10.  
A common grave danger confronts both our worlds.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	267

Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs. Johnson advances with a load of 
cold beers and Birdseye burritos...passing by a figure frozen in the 
shadows...OUR POV: THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR.  Mrs. Johnson gone, none 
the wiser.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	268

Mrs. Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight 
of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room...

MRS. JOHNSON
Oh, wow...

Reno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the 
HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the 
corner of Buckaroo's desk...

	269
JOHN EMDALL
After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, 
the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as 
your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and 
condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend 
eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed 
too good for their ilk.

	270
RENO
Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her?

MRS. JOHNSON
She's not in her room...I looked.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing?

	271
JOHN EMDALL
Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and 
the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely 
away on another plane of existence.

	272
Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere 
in the room...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
"John Parker" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike 
dressed up in aluminum foil.  With a weird album...how the hell was I 
supposed to know he came from outer space?

Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the HOLOGRAM...

John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man...	273

JOHN EMDALL
And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin 
further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns 
us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back 
through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should 
attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic 
communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to 
Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.

PERFECT TOMMY
An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American 
first strike!

JOHN EMDALL
Exactly, Perfect Tommy.  The Soviets will retaliate.  Your President 
Widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike...and within twenty 
minutes the danger to Planet 10 will be removed...

RENO
God, if it's not one thing it's another.

JOHN EMDALL
But...because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your 
planet.  Stop John Whorfin before sunrise! If you fail we will be 
forced to help you destroy yourselves.  End of discussion.

	274
There's an awful pause...and then a SCREECH as John Emdall spirals 
downward into the grooves of the record again.

	275
CASPER LINDLEY
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You wanna take the chance, Casper?

CASPER LINDLEY
Not me. No way.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula.  
Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!

Buckaroo heading for the door...

RENO
Where're you goin'?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To get my guns.

PERFECT TOMMY
His guns?  Holy shit.

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	276

...Professor Hikita and his assistant leaning over the electron tube 
apparatus, removing a rubber stopper from one of the receptacles, in 
the process GETTING AN ACCIDENTAL WHIFF of that BIZARRE GLOWING GREEN 
COMPOUND...Professor Hikita and assistant letting out gasps, seeing a 
sight that nearly stops their hearts...

THEIR POV	277

AT THE WINDOW...JOHN BIGBOOTÉ...AND A RED ARACHTOID!

	278
Professor Hikita, petrified, stepping back, grabbing the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER and knocking over a chair, as THE ALIEN CREATURE smashes 
the window!

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDOR - NIGHT	279

Rawhide, hearing screams from the Professor's laboratory, races down 
the corridor, gun drawn...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	280

Buckaroo coming into his bedroom, opening a dresser drawer when 
suddenly...A NOISE BEHIND HIM!  Buckaroo whirling instinctively with 
twin EBONY HANDLED COLTS a fraction of a second from firing...at PENNY!

...the latter poking her head out of Buckaroo's closet just long enough 
to see him aim his silver pistols, jumping back into the closet, 
slamming the door...an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the 
closet, finding it locked...knocking...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open up or I'll shoot it off.

PENNY PRIDDY
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I 
thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like 
me.

Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, 
seeing THE PHOTOGRAPH on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet-
so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo...his pretty companion A DEAD 
RINGER FOR PENNY.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, look-

PENNY'S VOICE
You look.  Who is she?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's 
maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet 
door.

PENNY'S VOICE
Yeah, whose world is coming to an end?  You only wanted me because I 
remind you of her.

Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with 
arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we 
got married, and that's about all I can say.  Right now.
(no response)
Penny?

A silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking...slowly 
opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female 
clothing...

PENNY PRIDDY
Married--?  So that's it!  Buckaroo Banzai, a married man.  Where is 
she?  With the kids some place?

Buckaroo turning...Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul...

PENNY PRIDDY
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like 
you...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was killed, Penny.

PENNY PRIDDY
Oh, my.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.

A pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back 
to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the 
dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories...

PENNY PRIDDY
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around 
here!

PENNY PRIDDY
How did she die?  I wanna know.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You don't wanna know.

PENNY PRIDDY
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.

PENNY PRIDDY
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime 
League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of 
Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I wish he was.  He's real enough.

Penny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his 
guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a 
BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed 
photograph of Peggy...

PENNY PRIDDY
God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which 
I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget 
her though.

One look at Buckaroo says it all...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Never.

PENNY PRIDDY
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got 
mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go where?  Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(squatting close to her)
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic.  
Because it's gonna be all right.

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.

PENNY PRIDDY
Believe in Penny Priddy?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Absolutely.

Penny looks into his eyes...

PENNY PRIDDY
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another 
adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go 
with you.  Please...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's too dangerous.

PENNY PRIDDY
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...

Starry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige 
when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK...

...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in...
	281

PERFECT TOMMY
(breathless)
Buckaroo--! Sorry--

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is it, Tommy?

PERFECT TOMMY
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going 
haywire over at the lab...

Buckaroo running for the door, calling over his shoulder to Penny:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stay here, I'll be back.

PENNY PRIDDY
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	282

Buckaroo, the Cavaliers, and the Lindleys race out of the house toward 
the research building...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	283

Penny hurriedly changes clothes...puts on Peggy's clothes...when 
suddenly THE SIGHT OF JOHN O'CONNOR standing in the hallway door, 
leering at her...

PENNY PRIDDY
Whadda you want?

John O'Connor, remembering her from the press conference...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Nothing right now, Penny Priddy.

John O'Connor vanishing...Penny again at a loss...

INT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE - NIGHT	284

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers running inside, racing up a bright yellow 
staircase to the second floor...

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	285

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers entering, finding the motionless lab 
assistant in Professor Hikita's wrecked laboratory...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Dead.  Damnit!

PERFECT TOMMY
Where's the professor?

RENO
Where's Rawhide?

CASPER
Who'd do a thing like this?

NEW JERSEY
Arachtoids.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Spread out. They can't be far.

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDORS - NIGHT	286

SHOTS of Cavaliers in empty hallways, guns drawn, discovering evidence 
of intruders...OFFICES RANSACKED, FURNITURE UPSET...EXPERIMENTS FOULED 
UP...

	287
...Buckaroo turning a corner, finding a SMALL AMOUNT OF SMOKE in the 
hallway...turning the corner...

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	288

...stepping into a LARGE ROOM clouded with SMOKE from a burning file 
cabinet, Rawhide and a HULDING FORM struggling in the gloom...

...Buckaroo unable to get a clear shot at the beast when suddenly 
Rawhide succeeds in knocking his adversary to the floor, the "man" 
HISSING!

RAWHIDE
Look out, Buckaroo!

Rawhide putting himself in the line of fire, suddenly clutching his 
lower back...Buckaroo starting toward Rawhide but...

RAWHIDE
Behind you!

Buckaroo turning as THE SHADOW OF THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR falls on his 
back!

...Buckaroo firing his guns, wounding the creature, the disoriented 
FIGURE retreating out into the corridor as Buckaroo turns in time to 
see Rawhide's assailant dive into a hole in the floor!  A hole in the 
floor?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You okay?

RAWHIDE
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the 
Overthruster...

Buckaroo edging toward that strange orifice in the linoleum, going into 
it himself...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT	289

As Penny rushes in, her ears picking up weird noises...THE SOUND OF 
PEOPLE in the acoustical tiles overhead...Penny trying to follow the 
racket down the first-floor hallway...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	290

Buckaroo in the dim light of the crawl space, making his way past air-
conditioning ducts toward the sound of someone or something crawling up 
ahead...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Professor--!?

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Here, Buckaroo!

SOUNDS IN THE DARKNESS, Buckaroo holding his pistol still at the ready 
but useless in these cramped quarters...Buckaroo finding a worklight, 
flicking it on...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	291

Penny meanwhile following the NOISES AND VOICES OVERHEAD into an empty 
office, grabbing a ladder and knocking out a ceiling panel...

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo!  Rawhide!  Reno?  Anybody?

	292
ANOTHER POV...unfortunately someone else is watching Penny from inside 
that very office...the wounded John O'Connor sitting in a swivel desk 
chair behind the door, oozing blood of a strange color and consistency, 
staring ferociously at Penny...MORE CLATTER OVERHEAD...as Penny 
elevates herself partially into the hole...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	293

PENNY'S POV...Professor Hikita only yards away, on his belly, able to 
come no further, unable to wedge himself beneath a large duct...the 
arachtoid John Bigbooté closing in behind the professor...Buckaroo 
closing in behind Bigbooté.

PROF.  HIKITA
Take it, young lady!  Grab it!

	294
Unseen by John Bigbooté, the OVERTHRUSTER skittering across the crawl 
space and into Penny's hands!

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	295

Penny stepping down off the chair and onto the desk top, her back still 
to the wounded John O'Connor as she quickly stuffs the OVERTHRUSTER 
into her purse...an action unseen by the ghastly, bleeding thug who...

	296
...EXTENDS HIS ARM UP AND ACROSS THE ROOM...HIS HUMAN HAND TIGHTENING 
AROUND HER MOUTH...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	297

Buckaroo advancing toward the professor...

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Go back, Buckaroo!

The arachtoid John Bigbooté whirling, firing a STINGER that whizzes 
past Buckaroo's head, missing by inches...as Buckaroo FIRES 
twice...John Bigbooté screaming...kicking at a small fresh air vent, 
somehow squeezing his huge body out the tiny opening like a rat.

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	298

Buckaroo helping Professor Hikita up out of the floor...Rawhide lying 
very still now, surrounded by Reno, Perfect Tommy and New Jersey...

...one look between New Jersey and Buckaroo sufficient to tell us that 
Rawhide hasn't got a chance...Buckaroo kneeling beside his old pal, 
Rawhide forcing a smile...

RAWHIDE
You're a welcome sight...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Just 'grazed' you, huh?

New Jersey extracting a strange MANY-PRONGED STINGER from Rawhide's 
back.  Buckaroo looking at it...Rawhide maintaining a sense of humor...

RAWHIDE
Apache?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoid.

RAWHIDE
So I was right.  That's nice to know...

Across the room, Pinky Carruthers comes in with Casper and Scooter 
Lindley, and that black man from Planet 10, John Parker...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to...

Pinky's words catching in his throat as he sees Rawhide's condition.

	299
Buckaroo turning, seeing not a 'guy' but A GIANT ARACHTOID standing 
there...

	300
Rawhide fading fast, Buckaroo lobbing the STINGER to "John Parker"...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Any antidote for these things?

John Parker holding the stinger in his palm...

JOHN PARKER
No, none.

...as it suddenly comes alive!  He drops it to the floor, stomps it to 
death...

PERFECT TOMMY
That mean you're on our side?

RAWHIDE
(sinking)
We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo.

Buckaroo turning from the BLACK ARACHTOID to his dying buddy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
We will, old fried, we will.

RAWHIDE
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...

BUT RAWHIDE CLOSING HIS EYES FOR THE FINAL TIME, as Buckaroo feels for 
a pulse...the look in the great man's eyes saying it all...sadness 
mixed with anger...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There's another one we owe 'em.

...THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER STARTING UP...

CASPER LINDLEY
They're stealing my chopper!

The Cavaliers racing for the window...

RENO
And they got Penny!  Look!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't shoot!

PROF. HIKITA
She has the Overthruster!

JOHN PARKER
Then your planet is doomed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No!
(calmer)
We'll get it back.

Buckaroo shoving Perfect Tommy aside, at the window himself now.

BUCKAROO'S POV...a fleeting glimpse of THE STOLEN LINDLEY CHOPPER...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	302

CLOSE ON the familiar face of the Secretary of Defense seen from an 
unusual angle...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL PRESIDENT WIDMARK lying on his 
belly, surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of 
government, staring down at a special mirror that reflects his 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary pressing a point further an 
igniting a Camel with a lighter from the President's nightstand.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
It's not Buckaroo Banzai per se, Mr. President. It's his men...some of 
then foreigners...Asiatics, their names changed, their true backgrounds 
shrouded in secrecy! I mean, when you come right up against it, what do 
we really know about any of 'em?

A NURSE appears with two little pills...

NURSE
These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That's okay, Bonnie, I won't be operating any heavy machinery today.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(desperate)
We've never had a weapon like the Jet Car in the past, Mr. President.  
Light-weight, highly mobile, stick on some anti-tank missiles, a couple 
grenade launchers, hell, we could buy ourselves two hundred Jet Cars 
for the price of ten tanks, send 'em swarming all over Ivan like bumble 
bees, sir, right clear through their precious little Iron Curtain like 
it was Swiss cheese!  They gotta be just scared shitless!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
As are all sane men today.

SECREATRY OF DEFENSE
Hey, and me too.  That's why I'm saying until Buckaroo Banzai agrees to 
submit his boys to at least a routine government security check, that 
Jet Car should be in the hands of Defense, and if they won't sell us 
the technology, then Mr. President, by God, sir, we have got to take 
it!  In the national interest.

The lighter in the Secretary's hand suddenly BEEPING, startling him and 
prompting the President to claim the gizmo and point it at...

	303
...an astounding TV-telephone where the FACE OF BUCKAROO BANZAI 
APPEARS...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it 
like out there in the real world?

Secretary of Defense McKinley stepping around behind the bed, coming 
into Buckaroo's field of vision...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something 
very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like 
the Earth's caught in a crossfire.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT	304

On a highway somewhere near the Eastern seaboard, Buckaroo's bus speeds 
toward Yoyodyne...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	305

Buckaroo standing at a TV-telephone in his MOBILE ELECTRONIC NERVE 
CENTER, the arachtoidal John Parker right at his side amid a flurry of 
activity... technicians accumulating INFO on THE ALIEN FATHER SHIP FROM 
PLANET 10...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To cut right to the bottom line on this, sir, we have reason to believe 
that there are moving freely among us, vicious red aliens disguised as 
the owners and operators of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

...Perfect Tommy, Reno, even Casper Lindley, coming in and out of the 
picture, transforming themselves into a crack commando unit donning 
assault/chemical-warfare uniforms...little Scooter Lindley among them, 
too, doing like his dad.

	306
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Yoyodyne Propulsion?  The people working on our Truncheon bomber?  
Under control of alien nationals?  Reds?  Commies, you say?

	307
...New Jersey studying an initial computer enhancement of THE AWESOME 
BLACK ARACHTOID SHIP HEADED TOWARD EARTH...

	308
BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not exactly, Mr. Secretary, no.  Real aliens.  Giant red arachtoids 
camouflaged as human beings...and what they're really building, forget 
your Truncheon bomber, Mr. Secretary, is this enormous rocketship to 
escape back through the Eighth Dimension and then on to Planet 10.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Now wait one second...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The gentleman standing here with me is called John Parker, and he can 
corroborate everything I've said because he's from Planet 10 too.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	309

The President dumbfounded...John Parker on TV appearing as nothing more 
than a wild and wooly Rastafarian...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo...you and I, we go back a long, long way together...but...

JOHN PARKER ON TV
(interrupting)
Time is short, Mr. President. To prevent John Whorfin's escape, my 
comrades are at this moment taking up a geostationary position over New 
Jersey. This situation is explosive!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Explosive? What are you saying, man? Some kind of race war in New 
Jersey--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, sir.  This 'man' as you call him, is not a human being, Mr. 
President.  He's a black arachtoid.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
That's some kind of spider, isn't it?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	310

New Jersey joins Professor Hikita at a microscope, analyzing a slide 
smeared with that weird alien 'blood'...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Buckaroo, my good friend...I'd like to help you...but don't you think I 
would've heard from my SAC radar by now if...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	311

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
SAC wouldn't know what to look for, sir.  Because these black 
arachtoids are cleverly hidden inside a huge thundercloud.

The Secretary of Defense takes action, picks up a phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Get me John Bigboote at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, Inc.  Then...
(to the President)
...the FBI.  Let's see if this spade's wanted.  What the hell's his 
name again?  Jackson?

JOHN PARKER ON TV
Parker.  I have delivered a hologram from my president, John Emdall, 
who has made it clear that unless John Whorfin is destroyed at once, 
she intends to fire an atomic beam from your American airspace...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
A what?

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are 
ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other 
off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each 
other pretty well, I think.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
John...?  John Bigboote?  Right, Bigbooté, sorry.  Anyway, hey, guy, 
how's everything over there at Yoyodyne?  How's my big bomber coming?  
Nothing out of the, you know, ordinary?  Spiders?  I know you're 
busy...lunch?  Sounds good...when's good for you?  Next Tuesday?  I'm 
writing it down in my book.  See you then...Uncle Sam's treat.

The Secretary writes nothing down, hangs up, looking unsatisfied with 
the conversation just concluded.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	312

Buckaroo glancing over at Professor Hikita and New Jersey, the latter 
squinting into the microscope...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Well.  I don't know what to say, Buckaroo...aliens from Planet 10, 
nuclear extortion, spiders in thunder clouds, a girl named "John"...

NEW JERSEY
There's your answer!  Electromagnetic bacterial crap!

PROF. HIKITA
Programmable!

NEW JERSEY
We inhale the bacteria.  It swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms 
our consciousness.  Diabolical.  We only see what they want us to see.

PROF. HIKITA
Electric brainwashing.

John Parker nearby, helping Reno synthesize more of Professor Hikita's 
ARACHTOIDAL ANTIDOTE and pour the liquid into GAS MASK FILTERS...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY STEPPING CLOSER INTO THE PICTURE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Just curious, Buckaroo, but where's the Jet Car at these days?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I've got it, Mr. Secretary.  But unfortunately the Oscillation 
Overthruster is in Penny Priddy's possession and she's been kidnapped 
and taken to Yoyodyne, further exacerbating the situation. We're on our 
way there right now.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	313

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Who the hell's Penny Priddy?

The Secretary of Defense giving the President a sly 'I told you so' 
look...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	314

Perfect Tommy coming over, interrupting...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, John Parker has the arachtoid cloud on line 2!

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	315

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Excuse me a moment, Mr. President.  We're talking to the cloud right 
now.

And his image fades.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Good God...

The President picks up the phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command. I want 
some hard data on that cloud. We got any killer satellites over Jersey-
-?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	316

Everyone studying a much MORE DETAILED COMPUTER ENHANCEMENT of the 
alien cloud...

The Alien John Parker on the phone, whispering...	317

RENO 
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to John Parker)
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.

JOHN PARKER
(into phone)
Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a virtue, Wing Commander, sir.

Perfect Tommy interrupting again, holding yet another telephone...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?

INT.  SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	318

Meanwhile in a grimy narrow control booth high above the factory floor, 
a terrified Penny Priddy sits BOUND and GAGGED, John O'Connor SPREADING 
THE CONTENTS FROM A HONEY-BEAR SQUEEZE BOTTLE over her naked arms while 
long trails of ORDINARY PICNIC ANTS make their way up her legs...John 
Bigbooté looking on...

Penny's UNOPENED big clear plastic purse on Doctor Lizardo's desk, the 
OVERTHRUSTER right under his nose and he doesn't even know it as he 
speaks into the phone handed to him by an ASSISTANT.  BEGIN 
INTERCUTTING.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Well, well...Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you don't remember me?  Ah, I'm 
flattered.  We know the same people.  In fact, one of them is here with 
me now...your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.

	319
BUCKAROO BANZAI
"Doctor"--?

	320
DOCTOR LIZARDO
May I pass along my congratulations for your great achievement.  In the 
miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly enshrined! However...
(a pause)
...Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem. And provide the 
crucial missing circuit for my Overthruster.  Perhaps you can convince 
her to try.

Lizardo holding the phone toward Penny, ripping her gag off...

PENNY PRIDDY
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me! 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny--?!  Are you all right?

Doctor Lizardo yanking the phone from Penny, remaining silent for a 
second to torture Buckaroo's soul...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She knows nothing, Lizardo.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Then shall we say "A Penny for your thoughts?" You can come in her 
place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone, with your Overthruster!
(hanging up)
He'll bring it.  I know his type.

Penny glancing surreptitiously at her large transparent purse, THE 
OVERTHRUSTER IN A JUMBLE OF COSMETICS!

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Take her to the pit!  Use more honey.  Find out what she knows.

Smiling smugly, Lizardo heads for the door, Penny squirming in her seat 
as the TINY ANTS dig in...

PENNY PRIDDY
Who are you?  Hanoi Shan?  The Scourge of Burma!  The Pivot of Mystery?  
Well, you're not destroying me like you did my sister!

Lizardo simply sneering at her as he goes out the door...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT	321

A flurry of well-ordered activity taking place...Hong Kong Cavaliers 
and Blue Shield Irregulars along with Pinky Carruthers.  Casper and 
Scooter...sitting up front like paratroopers, cleaning their back-pack 
FLAMETHROWERS...SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS...Buckaroo giving them a chalk talk, 
an aerial photograph of Yoyodyne on the clear plexiglas 'blackboard'...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see 
them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't 
be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we 
fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.

JOHN PARKER
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.

Buckaroo nodding...THE CAVALIERS BREATING THEIR ANTIDOTE FILTERS, 
SEEING NOW "THE ALIEN" JOHN PARKER WITH A MIXTURE OF DISBELIEF AND 
HORROR...Casper and Scooter Lindley especially unsettled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the Overthruster.  
That'll be my job: get it back in one piece.  Here's the main gate.  
I'll pass through first, alone.  The rest of you divide into two strike 
groups-Apache Team...that's you, Reno...and Chaparral Team, Perfect 
Tommy.  John Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

Perfect Tommy not too thrilled about that.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Top priority is the Overthruster. Whorfin can't escape without it. The 
built-in tracking device should make it relatively simple to 
locate...maybe hard to get.

INT.  BOWELS OF YOYODYNE - NIGHT	322

Penny being dragged by John O'Connor through a slimy underground 
corridor, past a strange piece of machinery.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT	323

The President of the United States talks into a cigarette lighter and 
peeks up a nurse's skirt by means of his floor mirror...

	324
MIRRORED POV:  The nurse's reflection replaced by that of his NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR...

	325
PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody 
figure this lighter out?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
No, sir.  I think the flint...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
What's happening with my call to SAC?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They 
report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no 
cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same 
problem.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Should we be on Code Red?

GENERAL CATBURD
We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red...no sense jumping off 
half-cocked, Mr. President.

The President twisting around to glower at Catburd eating an orange, 
sitting near a table of flowers and fruit baskets.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
I don't know...Buckaroo Banzai's never been wrong before.

Senator Cunningham pacing nervously...

GENERAL CATBURD
The man went through solid matter, for crying out loud. Who knows what 
it did to his brain...maybe scrambled his molecules. All I'm saying is, 
let's not panic here!  I'm sure there's a rational explanation...

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(turning from a strange phone)
Russian radar is down, sir.  They've just gone to Code Red.

Silence.  And then calmly and quietly:

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
We've got no choice then.  Call my wife.

The National Security Advisor turning back to his telephone:

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Code Red.  "Butch says we're crimson."

GENERAL CATBURD
Mr. President, none of us here are lunatics or irrational men...
(looking at Cunningham)
...or persons.  I'm a soldier and I'm a damn good one, enough 
decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don't mind telling you, I'm 
sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am scared. I'm 
barely holding my fudge right now.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself 
together.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts!
(pause)
Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first.  They think 
we're godless monsters just like them.  Put yourself in their 
samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over 
the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming 
into the Great Hall of the People.  Now, do you think they're gonna 
listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do 
you think they will?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(being handed a dispatch)
Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours.  We're both totally 
defenseless.  More or less.

GENERAL CATBURD
Hail Mary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
So what's our counter option, General Catburd?  Earn your salary.

GENERAL CATBURD
I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir.  Hit 'em 
primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their 
heads and do it to us first.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Larry, where's my Football?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Out in the hall, sir.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT	326

An apple-cheeked Marine Lieutenant sits watching a television soap 
opera, only the sinister BLACK BRIEFCASE chained to his wrist setting 
him apart from missions of other viewers...General Catburd sticking his 
head out of the President's room...

GENERAL CATBURD
What're you waiting for, boy?  Get in here with that thing.

...as an out-of-breath Mrs. Johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates, 
out-foxing SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and the rest of the President's 
entourage, cutting through, clutching the YELLOW RECORD...

MRS. JOHNSON
For the President!  From Buckaroo Banzai!

EXT.  RENDEZVOUS POINT - NIGHT	327

A dimly lighted parking lot not far from Yoyodyne.  A KOLODNY BROS. 
PLUMBING VAN arrives, disgorging several tough BLUE SHIELDS as Buckaroo 
and Professor Hikita confer...the alien John Parker doing some highly 
unusual warm-up exercises on the tarmac...Reno telling the arriving 
Blue Shields:

RENO
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.

PERFECT TOMMY
Asshole probably got lost.

NEW JERSEY
Or nailed for speeding.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can I have everyone's attention?  I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm 
not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight.  
It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and 
we all saw what happened to Rawhide.  So if for any reason this is 
good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs...

Buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to 
him, the Cavaliers smiling, needling him...

RENO
What, Buckaroo?  You trying to tell us something?

The JET CAR racing up, skidding to a stop, Billy jumping out, the big 
engine still running.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let's just fry those arachtoids.

Buckaroo embracing Professor Hikita, turning back to his men, pulling 
on his helmet:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Give me thirty minutes.  Then come in and mop up.

Buckaroo tossing a quick Blue Shield salute, shutting himself into his 
speed machine.

CLOSE ON THE PRESIDENT'S FACE...JOHN EMDALL'S VOICE OVER...talking

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Well... that's certainly food for thought.

	331
Mrs. Johnson lifting the needle off the SMOKING RECORD...as the 
President's National Security Advisor places a call on that ominous 
STRANGE PHONE, a palpable tension rising, urgency bordering on panic...

...General Catburd and the young Marine lieutenant rummaging through a 
confusion of envelops in the BLACK BRIEFCASE.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
No answer at the Kremlin, sir. Just dead silence.

GENERAL CATBURD
Here you go, Mr. President...the Sealed Authenticators.  The Plan D 
Documents for your eyes only...John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves 
a knockout little force posture...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
You know, on second thought, maybe we should think this through a bit 
more so that future generations of...

THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM START TO BLINK ON AND OFF...silencing the 
Senator...Catburd handing the President a writing implement...pulling 
out a special writing tray from the bed...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
"Name of the enemy"?  What, Planet 10?  My hand's shaking.  How on 
earth can I even...have to stay awake, alert...that's my job.  That's 
what the people put me here for.

In the nerve center of Yoyodyne, a nervous John Bigbooté watches Dr. 
Lizardo addressing his ragtag followers on the floor below...Bigbooté 
with his hands on Lizardo's mike cord, trying to get up enough nerve to 
pull the plug on his boss...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Blacks are on this planet! Here in New Jersey! Coming to destroy us! We 
must move! Escape or die! 

	335
OVER LIZARDO'S SHOULDER: A view down below on the littered floor of a 
huge aircraft factory that houses a GIANT SPOACESHIP OF BIZARRE DESIGN, 
a customized 747, wingless, jagged, the entire vehicle suspended twenty 
feet off the floor on movable cranes, work ladders stretching up to its 
several doors...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You must work faster to finish the Great Vehicle. So that we can enter 
the Eighth Dimension and free our trapped comrades! So we can return to 
our homeland and seize power once again! 

...Lizardo's followers extending their three-fingered hands in fascist 
salutes as he whips them into a feverish state:

BACK TO:	336

DR. LIZARDO
Where are we going?  Tell me!

RED ARACHTOIDS

DR. LIZARDO
When?

RED ARACHTOIDS
Real soon!

The Jet Car's engine shut down, Buckaroo CHECKING HIS OVERTHRUSTER 
HOMING DEVICE as he's trundled toward John Gomez, in a graveyard of 
HUGE YELLOW SPIKES, his eyes taking in everything, from the last-minute 
preparation of the GIANT SPACECRAFT to:

BUCKAROO'S POV...the evil figures of Dr. Lizardo and John Bigbooté 
standing high in the speed operator's pulpit...

	340
Buckaroo yanked out of the cockpit...John Gomez poking at the JET CAR'S 
dashboard, ripping out its cassette deck, finding the crucial 
Overthruster missing and shaking his head in Lizardo's direction.

JOHN GOMEZ
Not here!

THEIR POV	341

An angry John Bigbooté racing down the stairs toward the Jet Car...as 
over the PUBLIC ADDRESS BOOMS:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
WHERE IS THE OVERTHRUSTER!

BACK TO:	342

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I thought you had it!

For that seemingly flippant but honest answer, Buckaroo gets punched by 
John Bigbooté...doubling him over...

DR. LIZARDO'S VOICE
Take him to the Shock Tower!

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	343

Murky, dank, an insect paradise...Buckaroo standing trapped inside an 
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD...John Bigbooté looking on...

DIAGRAMS on A MONITOR SCREEN in rapid-fire order.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Solve them! The shock tower is a lie detector. Any untruth triggers a 
brutal charge to your auditory meatus...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You're not getting a damn thing outta me until Penny's safe.

DR. LIZARDO
Curse you, Banzai! Don't you realize what you're saying? Your planet's 
about to be destroyed, and you're wasting time like this...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I've got nothing but time.

CLOSE ON THE POLYGRAPH NEEDLE SUDDENLY JUMPING!	344

Lizardo pressing a button, administering a second SHOCK to Buckaroo, 
while an aide turns a dial, INCREASING THE VOLTAGE

DOCTOR LIZARDO
I want my missing circuit now!

INT/EXT.  PRESIDENT'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT	346

A VIEW OVER THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE'S SHOULDER as the chopper

She'll live...for a while, and she won't enjoy it.

Lizardo indicates his favorite monitor...the INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER 
equation flashing across its face.

Only you can save her from the fate of your friend, Mr. Rawhide!  Solve 
this equation.  I must have the crucial missing circuit.

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR...a riot of circuits and junctions...	348

Whorfin?  How do you know that's my real name?

What the hell are we doing?!  I don't believe this...what're we waiting 
for?  Christmas?

PROF. HIKITA
(checking his watch)
Ten minutes more.  Buckaroo's orders.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Damn Buckaroo!  I'm the eyes and ears of the President of these United 
States of America!  In loco presidentis!  Which means I'm in charge 
here!

PERFECT TOMMY
Not on this bus, you're not.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Who the hell do you think you are?

PERFECT TOMMY
Perfect Tommy.

That answer alone enough to drive the Secretary up the wall...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well let me tell you something, Mr. Perfect Tommy: I don't need this 
shit.  I could be on Easy Street with a cushy job in the private 
sector.  But instead,  I got me a nine-hundred-million-dollar way-the-
hell-behind-schedule top-secret bomber being built down there by 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and I don't intend to set twiddling thumbs 
in a bus while Buckaroo Banzai goes crashing around my airplane looking 
for his damn girlfriend, driving a car that itself is probably worth 
more to this country than all the tea in China!  I'm talking National 
Security risk and we are going in there like gentlemen and straighten 
this thing out before somebody gets hurt!  You got that?

...the Secretary suddenly grabbing a weapon from a surprised Blue 
Shield and turning it toward the driver...

REVERSE ANGLE...THE SECRETARY CRACKING A SHOT OFF AT THE WINDSHIELD!
	351

	352
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Hit it, soldier boy!  Move this buggy!  That's a goddamn executive 
order!

With his weapon trained on the driver, who's to stop him?

PERFECT TOMMY
Go ahead, Louie, do like the man says.

EXT.  HIGHWAY NEAR YOYODYNE - NIGHT	353

The double bus leaping forward, heading down the long approach road to 
Yoyodyne...past a BILLBOARD touting the aerospace achievements 
of...YOYODYNE-AN EXCITING, GROWING COMPANY...JUST ONE MILE 
AHEAD...PATROLLED BY AIRCRAFT.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT	354

The Cavaliers letting the Secretary of Defense call the shots for the 
moment, talking among themselves, Perfect Tommy squelching any notion 
of knocking off their hysterical hijacker:

PERFECT TOMMY
(whispering)
Hey, so we get into action quicker this way.  We tell Buckaroo our 
watches were fast.

Ordinary citizen John Parker taking a step toward the Secretary, 
offering him a gas mask...the Secretary turning on him...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
That's far enough, black boy...

A mystified John Parker stepping back.

	355
ANGLE TOWARD WINDSHIELD...the Secretary peering through the windshield 
at the chain link gates coming into view...YOYODYNE-AN EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.

REVERSE ON	356

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I'll handle the negotiations here...
(to the driver)
Slow her down.

EXT.  GUARD GATE/YOYODYNE - NIGHT	357

The Secretary getting out, coming around to the REDHEADED YOYODYNE 
GUARDS who try to peer in through the bus' tinted windows...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
You fellas got a phone?  Ring ahead and get me John Bigboote.  Tell 
him...

GUARD
It's Bigbooté.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What? Hell, I'll do it yourself if I want it done right, huh?

The Secretary pushing the astonished guards aside and picking up the 
telephone, the guards trying to stop him and in the process turning 
their backs on the bus as it SILENTLY CRUISES PAST THE GATE INTO 
YOYODYNE...

EXT.  DESERTED AREAS (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	358

...the bus coming to a stop in a scrap metal dump inside the big 
compound, Cavaliers and Blue Shields piling out, going with their 
assigned groups...Perfect Tommy's Chaparral Team following John Parker 
toward a normal looking building...

JOHN PARKER
Under here, I think.

PERFECT TOMMY
Under where?  Hold on...

But John Parker entering a crawl space beneath the huge 
building...Chaparral Team having no choice, following.

EXT.  YOYODYNE GATE - NIGHT	359

The Secretary of Defense struggling with the guards for possession of 
the phone, drawing his stolen weapon...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now you get this straight...you're up to your ass in alligators, and 
I'm here to drain the swamp.  So I'm gonna use this phone...because it 
is all over for you, Baby Blue...
(picking up the phone)
This is the Secretary of Defense at the poorly guarded west gate.  I 
wanna speak to John Bigbooté, person to person.  Okay, okay...Bigbooté.

EXT.  UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE/YOYODYNE - NIGHT	360

Reno's Apache Team (Casper and Scooter on board), finds yet ANOTHER 
UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE to the main building, slips in...

INT.  UNDERGROUND BUILDING - NIGHT	361

Chaparral Team (the alien, John Parker, Perfect Tommy) in the strange 
labyrinth of dark, low-ceilinged passageways, making their way 
cautiously...

PERFECT TOMMY
Hope you know where you're going, John Parker.  Because my nose is 
starting to whistle...

A FORM suddenly dropping from the ceiling, landing on Perfect Tommy, a 
fierce struggle in the darkness...John Parker to the rescue, garroting 
a RED ARACHTOID, Perfect Tommy helping himself up...

PERFECT TOMMY
Thanks.

JOHN PARKER
Don't mention it.

PERFECT TOMMY
Then I won't.

INT.  BIVOUAC ROOM - NIGHT	362

...John Parker leading the way again, up some unusual stairs...into the 
MAIN BIVOUAC ROOM, RED ARACHTOIDS apparently asleep in bizarre tents, 
others hanging from the ceiling like sloths, A STRANGE HEAVY HUMMING 
NOISE starting to fill the room...

JOHN PARKER
They sense us.  Hurry.

John Parker breaking into a run for the far end of the room, Perfect 
Tommy and the others following, John Parker hitting the door...and AN 
ALARM GOES OFF...Perfect Tommy opening fire at a HUGE GENERATOR...THE 
POWER DROPPING EVERYWHERE!

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	363

LIGHTS PULSING...ELECTIRICITY FAILING in the murky torture chamber 
giving Buckaroo just the change he needs to break free of the shock 
tower.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Stop him!  Get him!

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	364

Buckaroo ducking into a recessed doorway, taking cover against a wall 
wet with strange algae as various ARACHTOID GUARDS scramble past, ALARM 
BELLS AND SIRENS GROANING...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(to Bigbooté)
Kill the girl! 

...Buckaroo losing sight of the swift arachtoid John Bigbooté, 
resorting instead to his ELECTRONIC TRACKING DEVICE while...

INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	365

...Reno, New Jersey and Pinky Carruthers bring Apache Team down a 
flooded corridor, meeting some opposition.

INT.  DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT	366

Buckaroo spotting New Jersey in the confusion, the two of them tracking 
Penny electronically, descending concrete steps, moving down a dark 
corridor that we recognize...

INT.  LAUNCH HANGER - NIGHT	367

The Secretary of Defense meanwhile reaching the big hangar, confused, 
alarmed, chaos everywhere, shouting over the din:

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote!

...spotting John Bigbooté across the hangar floor, going after him, 
staring bug-eyed at the MONSTROUS-LOOKING SPACECRAFT suspended above 
the hangar floor...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell...that ain't no Truncheon bomber, my friend.  I never 
approved that!

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	368

The Secretary following the speedy John Bigbooté around a bend, unable 
to keep up...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote!

Bigbooté giving no indication of seeing him, rounding a corner ducking 
into his office...

...the Secretary rounding the corner too but seeing no sign of 
Bigbooté...instead just an office door, a nameplate reading JOHN 
BIGBOOTÉ, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT...the Secretary of Defense opening 
the door...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	369

...moving past a vacant receptionist's desk to John Bigbooté's 
cavernous, strangely furnished chamber...EMPTY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote?!  You can run, but you can't hide.  I want some facts!

...but no sign of John Bigbooté.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	370

Buckaroo and New Jersey still tracking Penny, moving through another 
flooded, slimy corridor we remember...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	371

...the Secretary spying a phone on the receptionist's desk amid 
scattered Oreo cookies, picking the phone up, clicking it a couple of 
times to get a dial tone...totally ignoring AN AMAZING FRAMED PICTURE 
OF A RED ARACHTOID MOTHER AND CHILD ON THE DESK RIGHT IN FRONT OF 
HIM...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Operator...operator...how the hell does a person get an outside line 
around here?

...his gaze now focusing squarely on that cheap framed photograph of 
the RED ARACHTOIDS...Secretary McKinley losing his bearings...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Oh, Lord.  Never mind...forget it...

...his mind reeling, refusing to accept the obvious, the oddly designed 
furniture and chairs in the room, somehow insect-like...a sudden 
sound...a WOMAN'S SCREAM that seems to come from...underneath the 
floor?

...the Secretary cocking his weapon and stepping around the desk as an 
amazing thing occurs...A TRAPDOOR IN THE OFFICE FLOOR opening, the 
Secretary going to investigate, able to observe...

	372
HIS POV of...John O'Connor coming up a ladder and, in the room below, a 
barely conscious Penny still in her private hell, trussed and taped, 
ANTS CRAWLING ON HER ARMS...the lurid specter of John Bigbooté staring 
at her...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	373

PENNY'S CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE UNOPENED ON THE DESK BESIDE HER, as the 
Secretary of Defense suddenly knocks John O'Connor down the ladder and 
jumps into the room, injuring his ankle...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell's is going on here, Bigboote? Where's my bomber? 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
That's 'Bigbooté'.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I don't give a flying handshake what it is! Where's my bomber?

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ 
Let's just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two 
reasonable... 

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Your private life's your own concern, pal.  Where the hell is my 
bomber?  Look at this place...where's your pride?  It's like a pigsty 
down here!

	374
THE TELESCOPING ARM of John Bigbooté suddenly shooting out and lifting 
the Secretary off the floor, banging him into the wall...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It's not my goddamn planet!  Understand, monkey boy!? 

...BIZARRE LAMPS SWAYING as GUNFIRE upstairs prompts Bigbooté to 
release the Secretary, to urge O'Connor to head for a door off the 
hallway...

JOHN O'CONNOR
But John Whorfin said kill her. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Damn John Whorfin--! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	375

Bigbooté and O'Connor emerging in the hallway...seen by Buckaroo Banzai 
and New Jersey as RED ARACHTOIDS...

JOHN PARKER
Look out, Buckaroo Banzai!

Buckaroo turning and just in time, the alien JOHN GOMEZ right behind 
him...and behind Gomez, John Parker and Perfect Tommy with flame 
throwers...

...Buckaroo and New Jersey hitting the deck as the RED ARACHTOID gets 
smoked, the aliens John Bigbooté and John O'Connor escaping in the 
confusion...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	376

The Secretary of Defense still on the floor, spotting the OVERTHRUSTER 
in Penny's purse, taking it just as Buckaroo and New Jersey rush into 
the room...lights swaying...shadows dancing...

...the Secretary struggling to his feet as Buckaroo cuts Penny 
down...spraying her with a white insecticide, New Jersey checking her 
vital signs, Buckaroo shocking New Jersey accidentally with a jolt of 
STATIC ELECTRICITY, as the Secretary slips the OVERTHRUSTER under his 
coat...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(to no one in particular)
It's not over yet...I'll bounce back...always have.  I'll come through 
this thing smelling like a goddamn rose-just watch me.

The Secretary limping out of the room...New Jersey trying to get 
penny's pulse while Buckaroo peels back her eyelids...

NEW JERSEY
Leave her to me. You take care of business. 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Thanks.

Buckaroo looking at New Jersey, knowing he can trust him, rummaging 
through Penny's purse...no Overthruster...

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	377

Dr. Lizardo and the alien John O'Connor and the alien John Bigbooté 
seeing their deteriorating position OVER A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV...VIDEO 
IMAGES OF THE INVADING FORCES...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Sound the call to board ship!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Without the crucial missing circuit?  We'll never make it! 

JOHN O'CONNOR
They are only monkey boys!  We can still crush them here--! 

Lizardo picking up a primitive INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER THE SIZE OF AN 
APPLE CRATE...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You heard my orders!  Activate the Special Horns!

INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	378

Buckaroo joining the alien John Parker, the two of them tearing down 
one of the flooded passages...suddenly covering their ears from those 
PAINFUL, EAR-SPLITTING HORNS!

INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT	379

Secretary of Defense McKinley makes his way through several RED 
ARACHTOIDS running in blind panic...SIRENS WAILING...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Coming through!  Clear it!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	380

...the light of a new day starting to glow through grimy windows...as 
down on the floor, Dr. Lizardo is about to scale a spindly ladder into 
his BIG SUSPENDED SPACESHIP...Lizardo spotting Buckaroo, John Parker 
and Hong Kong Cavaliers entering this sacred space...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Massacre them! Without quarter! 

Dr. Lizardo pushing his own soldiers aside, scurrying into his 
SPACESHIP with John Bigbooté and John O'CONNOR.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	381

no sooner inside than a cowardly order is issued to John O'Connor:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Close the doors! 

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	382

Meanwhile, the floor of the hangar...the alien John Parker using 
strange judo, the amazing Blue Shields fighting like Samurai, ducking 
STINGERS, FIREING into the enemy at point blank range...

	383
BUCKAROO SEEING Dr. Lizardo's engine start up, CLOUDS OF BLACK SMOKE 
pouring from the exhaust pipes...

	384
John Parker fighting his way toward the ship...

	385
WHILE OVER YONDER the Secretary of Defense spots the JET CAR unattended 
amid that field of weird yellow totems...

ANOTHER ANGLE	386

John Parker reaching the BIG SPACESHIP to find Buckaroo already there, 
Buckaroo taking the lead up a tall ladder that seems to reach to a REAR 
ENTRANCE.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	387

Buckaroo settling into a weird little chair, John Parker at his side, 
facing the opposite direction in a love-seat arrangement...at a wall 
cluttered with confusing instruments and a framed photo of LIZARDO...NO 
WAY INTO THE BIG SHIP FROM HERE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is this thing?  A fighter?

JOHN PARKER
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	388

John Bigbooté in the co-pilot's seat, as Doctor Lizardo attempts to 
connect his clumsy overthruster.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Overthruster in place. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It won't work! It won't! 

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Shut up, John Bigboote, you coward! 

John O'Connor pushing John Bigbooté aside as Lizardo hits another 
switch and for a fraction of a second ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE, A BLINDING 
GREEN LIGHT!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	389

The spacecraft lurches forward twelve feet!  Stops.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	390

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Again, John O'Connor!  Again!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	391

BEAST!

ANGLE ON THE WALL PULSING!	392

BUCKAROO BANZAI
They haven't got enough power.  They'll never penetrate!

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	394

Dr. Lizardo, a raging madman in the cockpit, using a RADIO MIKE:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Almost!  Almost!  Lower my vehicle onto the runway!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No!  Please!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	395

THE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT, TRAPPING THEM...

JOHN PARKER
We're going down!  Onto the runway!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The door's locked.

INT.  JET CAR/LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	396

Meanwhile, unnoticed, Secretary of Defense John McKinley reaches the 
JET CAR, starts to climb in...

SMALL VOICE
Another step, I'll drink your blood--!

The Secretary turning, not seeing anyone at first...then little Scooter 
Lindley with an M-14 trained on him...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Get 'em up!

Scooter means business...as he suddenly demonstrates, blowing away an 
oncoming ARACHTOID before turning the gun back on the Secretary, who 
raises his hands...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
What's that?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Can opener...just a...

Scooter taking the CURIOUS OBJECT from his prisoner, not fooled for a 
second.

Buckaroo and John Parker rattling in their seats!  No escape...

INT.  HANGER WALL - DAWN	401

The sudden "expulsion" by the wall of a TWEEDY, FLESHY OBJECT 
RESEMBLING A LUMP OF CLAY which rapidly begins to define itself as the 
real, 1938-MODEL BLACK-HAIRED DOCTOR LIZARDO, standing in total 
bewilderment, SEVERAL 15th CENTURY BUCCANEERS spit out next, equally 
disoriented...

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	402

The "other Lizardo" (Whorfin) meanwhile undergoing a painful reverse 
transformation: FROM OLD MAN BACK TO RED ARACHTOID!  HIS EYES 
GLOWING...LIGHT ENERGY GLOWING INSIDE HIS MOUTH!

JOHN WHORFIN (LIZARDO)
Full speed ahead!

JOHN BIGTOOTE
We haven't a chance.  Your Overthruster's for shit!  We'll all just...

JOHN WHORFIN
One more word out of you, Bigboote...

JOHN BIGTOOTE
Bigbooté.

WHORFIN'S ARM ELONGATING, FLASHING OUT, breaking John Bigbooté's neck!  
John O'Connor moving up a notch at Yoyodyne.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	403

Buckaroo and John Parker picking up all of Whorfin's intraship 
communications...

WHORFIN'S VOICE
Full speed ahead!  Battle stations!

	404
THEIR POV OF THE HANGER AREA:  nightmarish excitement down below!  The 
floor rushing up as...

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	405

The BIG SPACESHIP makes violent contact with its runway, rocketing 
ahead!

	406
THE COCKPIT POV AS THE SHIP RUSHES TOWARD THE WALL...the real Doctor 
Emillio Lizardo barely ducking out of the way!  Buccaneers scattering!

EXT.  HANGAR WALL/YOYODYNE - DAWN	407

UNCERTAIN FLIGHT...BANKING VIOLENTLY...

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	409

The crew of BLACK ARACHTOIDS aboard the ethereal father ship also at 
their battle stations...

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Banzai has failed!  John Whorfin is airborne!

BLACK ARACHTOID OFFICER
but not in the Eighth Dimension.  Shouldn't we wait?  Maybe John 
Parker-

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
I have my order from John Emdall!  8000 miles.  Mark.  Activate 
particle beam.  Lock on Smolensk.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	410

John Parker fiddling with a RADIO, homing in on the black ship's 
frequency, overhearing:

BLACK ARACHTOID CHATTER
Particle beam activated...lock on Smolensk...one minute to rapid 
rupture...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell them to stop.  They're your friends!

JOHN PARKER
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!

John Parker talking to the father ship as Buckaroo struggles to unlock 
the strange little saucer from Whorfin's big vehicle.

	411
BUCKAROO'S POV (SIDE OF SHIP)...THE PROBLEM.  A SERIES OF ODD SUCTION 
DEVICES outside holding the thermopod in place.

	412
CLOSE ON DASHBOARD.  Buckaroo finally finding the proper release 
switch!

EXT.  WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	413

CLOSE ON the SUCTION BOLTS disengaging!  Freeing the small craft!

EXT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	414

His vehicle falling sideways, John Parker trying to ignite its ENGINES!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	415

In a free fall, the engines finally igniting and the thermopod 
rocketing upward!

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	416

BLACK ARACHTOID OFFICER
Sir, a thermopod has peeled off from Whorfin's ship!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
So what?  Big deal.  Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

INT. THERMOPOD - DAWN	417

Buckaroo struggling to master the strange craft...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?

JOHN PARKER
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

John Parker trying a likely button.

Time running out...Buckaroo receiving fire from Whorfin's big 
spaceship, THE SMALL VEHICLE LURCHING...THE TWO VEHICLES ON A COLLISION 
COURSE!

EXT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	421

The little ship dropping like a stone, barely avoiding a head-on with 
Whorfin and company!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	422

Buckaroo unhappy with John Parker's marksmanship...their "love seat" 
rotating, reversing their functions...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Take the throttle, John Parker!

John Whorfin and John O'Connor scrambling into evasive action, but it's 
too late.

FIRING!  FIRING!

Banzai!  I'll see you in hell!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	426

FLYING ON A COLLISION COURSE once again, THE OVERTHRUSTER BEAM FINALLY 
HITTING HOME AND THE BIG SPACESHIP DISINTEGRATING, VAPORIZING...John 
Whorfin and his ilk history...

REVERSE ANGLE ON John Parker...still on a collision course with the 
GIANT BALL OF HOT VAPOR THAT WAS LORD WHORFIN...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!

JOHN PARKER
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?

BUCKAROO BANZAI

As the Cavaliers and Blue Shields anxiously watch, THE SKY CRACKLES AND

Deactivate particle beam!  Tracking zero zero zero!

EXT.  SKY - DAWN	430

The sun coming up...and as we wonder what terrible fate has befallen 
Buckaroo Banzai and John Parker...A TINY FIGURE APPEARS high in the 
clouds!  A BIZARRE PARACHUTE catching the wind, floating lazily to 
earth.

	431
CLOSER SHOT: Buckaroo!  Safe and sound, looking up and SALUTING John 
Parker as the little THERMOPOD flip-flops, tumbles heavenward AT AN 
INCREDIBLE RATE OF SPEED...heading home.

EXT.  YOYODYNE - DAWN	432

Buckaroo touching down...Professor Hikita among the victorious Blue 
Shields scarcely able to believe his eyes as he spots...no, it can't 
be...rising from the debris...

PROF. HIKITA
Emilio!

Now it's the young Doctor Lizardo's turn to stare incredulously...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Toichi--?  I'll be damned.

The two scientists approaching one another...afraid to touch as if the 
other might prove a mirage...

	433
RENO FINDING A CUTLASS ON THE GROUND...as Buckaroo, face blackened with 
soot, his clothing torn, hurries toward several Blue Shields (gas masks 
off) herding a half-dozen "HUMAN" PRISONERS while other Shields and 
Cavaliers share congratulatory handshakes...RED STINGERS still stuck in 
their bullet-proof vests...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?

PERFECT TOMMY
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy 
if you want my opinion.

Perfect Tommy and Reno pacing Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Got a casualty list?

RENO
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're 
illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could 
throw the book at 'em...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back 
to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't 
in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and 
inside out...

Perfect Tommy whistling...

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, Scooter Lindley, fall in!

Scooter's eyes lighting up as he runs over...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Is this what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

The Oscillation Overthruster, safe and sound.  Buckaroo amazed, 
receiving the precious object, giving Scooter a Blue Shield 
salute...the Secretary of Defense watching jealously from a short 
distance, his clothing disheveled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Looks like one Junior Shield is in line for a ride in The Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!
(suddenly crestfallen)
I'll have to ask my dad.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Well, go ahead, what're you waiting for?

Scooter running off.

	434
A dour-faced, shaken New Jersey appears in the doorway of the big bus, 
Buckaroo's smile immediately vanishing...

NEW JERSEY
I did all I could.  I did my best...

Buckaroo racing past new Jersey and into the bus...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUT - DAWN	435

Buckaroo hurrying through the front section.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAWN	436

Buckaroo hurrying through the COMMUNICATIONS NERVE CENTER...

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Buckaroo, Reno said check with you - something about "pirates"?  He 
mean the baseball team?

No response.

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Buckaroo, the President's on line on.  Calling about is everything okay 
with the alien space cloud and Planet Ten...or should he just go ahead 
and destroy Russia...? 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell him yes on "1" and no on "2". 

Buckaroo going into his PRIVATE REAR SECTION of the bus...

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Which was "yes"? Destroy Russia? Or "2"...?

INT. BEDROOM/BUS - DAWN	437

Buckaroo reaching his private quarters, finding Penny on his cot, a 
sheet pulled over her face...ethereal morning light caressing her still 
body...

...Buckaroo distraught, pulling the sheet back to reveal Penny in final 
repose, speckled with dead ants, honey and powdery white insecticide... 
Buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish.

	438
His lips moving toward hers...when suddenly a SPARK LEAPS OUT, ARCING 
FROM THE TIP OF BUCKAROO'S NOSE TO THE TIP OF PENNY'S!

	439
And she stirs...a faint nerve response, Buckaroo seizing her with both 
hands...SPARKS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny!

...shaking her, exhorting her...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open your eyes!  Look at me!  Penny!

...but nothing, no more signs of life...

...Buckaroo kissing her in despair, pressing his lips against her 
lips...the kiss of the century, A POWERFUL ELECTRIC JOLT!

	441
...the fire of life as Penny opens her eyes, sees her haggard hero 
before her.

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo...you look awful.

	442
And indeed they both do, but who cares?  ANOTHER GALVANIC KISS, 
CRACKLING GOOD as the tiny bedroom heats up and we do the decent 
thing...IRIS OUT...as CREDITS ROLL and the FANTASTIC VOICE OF Dr. 
Buckaroo Banzai serenades us home...

...the Hong Kong Cavaliers harmonizing like honey, the world once again 
a safe, snug harbor.

          EXT. SKY - JUST ABOVE CLOUDS - NIGHT
          
          OMINOUS, THREATENING MUSIC. The upper tail fin of a jet
          plane emerges through the cloud layer and PASSES THROUGH the
          FRAME like a shark's fin through water. It passes by again
          in the opposite direction. MUSIC BUILDS as the fin comes
          straight TOWARD the CAMERA, MUSIC SWELLS to CRESCENDO as
          entire jet plane lifts out of clouds and passes overhead.
          TITLE SLASHES ACROSS SCREEN, "AIRPLANE!"

                   The white zone is for immediate loading
                   and unloading of passengers only. There is
                   no stopping in the red zone.

                   The red zone is for immediate loading and

                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   No. The white zone is for loading and
                   unloading, and there is no stopping in the
                   red zone.

                   The red zone has always been for loading
                   and unloading, and there is never stopping
                   in a white zone.

                   and which zone is for loading.

                   Listen, Betty. Don't start up with your
                   white zone shit again!

          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elaine is approached by a religious ZEALOT #1.
          
                                  ZEALOT #1
                   Hello, we'd like you to have this flower
                   from the Religious Consciousness Church.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   No, but thank you very much.
          
          Arrival-Departure TV monitors. Elaine approaches.

          BACK TO ELAINE
          
          She checks her watch and walks past Security Check area.
          CAMERA STAYS with a middle-aged couple, SHIRLEY and JACK,
          waiting to pass through Security Check. Behind them is sign
          reading: WARNING, HIJACKING IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE, etc.
          
                                  SHIRLEY
                   Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there
                   in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our
                   flight to Chicago.
          
                                  JACK
                   Yeah, I think he is.
                        (waves)
                   Hey, Fred!
          
          FRED recognizes Jack.
          
                                  FRED 
                        (yelling)
                   Hi, Jack!!!
          
          A swarm of police and airport security men descend on Fred
          and take him away.
          
          EXT. AIRPORT - PASSENGER LOADING ZONE - NIGHT
          
          A limousine arrives. Two colorfully dressed BLACK DUDES
          emerge. An extra pesters them. Two HARE KRISHNA'S arrive on
          foot and walk toward terminal.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   There's just no stopping in the white
                   zone.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)
                   Christ, you're as bad as your mother!
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   Oh, really, Vernon! Why pretend? We both
                   know perfectly well what it is you're
                   talking about. You want me to have an
                   abortion.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)
                   It's really the only sensible thing to do.
                   If it's done properly, therapeutically,
                   there's no danger involved.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   Have you considered that what's inside me
                   is a human being; that it's alive. We made
                   love. It's us -- you and me.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTER (male v.o.)
                   That isn't true. A fetus at this stage is
                   not a human being, nor is it a person.
          
          Krishnas enter terminal building.
          
          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          The Krishnas are approached by the Religious Zealot.
          
                                  ZEALOT #2
                   Hello, we'd like you to have this flower
                   from the Church of Consciousness. Would
                   you like to make a donation?
          
                                  KRISHNA 
                        (shakes his head) 
                   No, we gave at the office.
          
          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          A voluptuous BLONDE saunters through the airport, clears her
          throat loudly, and spits on the wall.
          
          She walks past an ELDERLY WOMAN standing outside a men's
          room door. She turns and sticks her head in the door.
          
                                  ELDERLY WOMAN
                   Go, O.J., go!!
          
          INT. SECURITY CHECK AREA - NIGHT

                   Please put your metal objects on this
                   tray.
          
          He puts his watch, keys on the tray. Then removes his metal
          arm and metal leg.
          
          EXT. TERMINAL BUILDING - PASSENGER LOADING AREA - NIGHT
          
          MR. and MRS. HAMMEN and their eight year old son, JOEY,
          arrive in a station wagon. They unload luggage.

          The Hammens walk toward terminal past a BUSINESSMAN.
          
                                  BUSINESSMAN
                   Taxi!
          
          A taxi cab skids to a stop in front of him. The Businessman
          gets in as the driver, TED STRIKER, drops the flag and
          rushes out.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Back in a minute.

          Striker enters, looking around as if searching for someone.
          People are rolling down the conveyor belt of a baggage
          carousel, banging into each other like luggage. The luggage
          is standing around the conveyor belt, waiting for the people
          to come off.
          
          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT
          
          Striker, walking briskly, is approached by Zealot #3 who
          tries to pin a flower on his jacket. Striker keeps walking
          but the Zealot is persistent. Finally, Striker slips out of
          his jacket leaving the Zealot with the coat.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)
                   Your attention, please. Flight seven-

          to direct plane to his right.
          
          CREDITS END.
          
                                  GROUND CREWMAN #2
                   Hey, Joe, where's the forklift?
          
                                  GROUND CREWMAN #1
                   The forklift? It's over there by the
                   baggage loader.
          
          He points to the left with his flashlights. Flight 733
          follows flashlights and CRASHES into terminal.

          INT. TERMINAL BULIDING - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT
          
          Striker catches up to Elaine.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Elaine!
          
                                  ELAINE
                        (surprised)
                   Ted!
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I came home early and found your note. I
                   guess you meant for me to read it later.
                   Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I just don't want to go over it any more.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I know things haven't been right for a
                   long time, but it'll be different. If
                   you'll just be patient, I can work things
                   out.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I have been patient and I've tried to
                   help, but you wouldn't even let me do
                   that.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Don't you feel anything for me at all any
                   more?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It takes so many things to make love last.
                   Most of all it takes respect. And I can't
                   live with a man I don't respect!
          
          She leaves.
          
                                  STRIKER
                        (to CAMERA)

          INT. DR. TURNANSKY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          DR. TURNANSKY is seated at desk. Behind him are shelves
          filled with mayonnaise jars.
          
                                  TURNANSKY
                   There's a passenger on your Chicago flight
                   two-oh-niner, a little girl named Lisa
                   Davis -- en route to Minneapolis. She's
                   scheduled for a heart transplant and we'd
                   like you to tell her mother that we found
                   a donor an hour ago.
          
          On his desk is a beaker containing a beating heart.
          
                                  TURNANSKY
                   We have the heart here ready for surgery
                   and we must have the recipient on the
                   operating table within six hours.
          
          The heart jumps out of the beaker, across the desk and falls
          off the edge.
          
                                  TURNANSKY
                   I want you to make sure she is kept in a
                   reclined position and that a continuous
                   watch is kept on her I.V.

          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elaine and Striker are walking together.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow
                   night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I won't be back. I've requested the
                   Atlanta run.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really
                   can change.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Then why don't you take the job that Louie
                   Netz offered you at Boeing?
          
          In the b.g. an airline PORTER is transporting an ELDERLY
          COUPLE in an electric cart. They round the corner too fast
          and the woman falls out. Husband doesn't notice.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   You know I haven't been able to get near
                   an airplane since the war. And even if I
                   could, they wouldn't hire me because of my
                   war record.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Your war record? You're the only one
                   keeping that alive. For everyone else it's
                   ancient history.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   You expect me to believe that?
          
          In the b.g. the Elderly Woman staggers to her feet and is
          immediately run over by another electric cart.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It's the truth. What's hurt you the most
                   is your record since the war. Different
                   cities, different jobs, and not one of
                   them shows you can accept any real
                   responsibility.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   But if you'll just give me...
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It's too late, Ted. When I get back to
                   Chicago, I'm going to start my life all
                   over again. I'm sorry.
          
          She walks off. Dramatic MUSIC as Striker glares with
          determination. The religious Zealot tries to pin a flower on
          his lapel.
          
                                  ZEALOT #3
                   Hello, we'd like you to have this...
          
          Without looking, Striker decks the Zealot with one punch. He
          walks after Elaine.
          
          INT. COCKPIT - FLIGHT 209 - NIGHT
          
          Clarence Oveur is in the pilot's seat. VICTOR BASTA is
          seated at engineer's console. There is a St. Christopher's
          statue on the dashboard.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Any word on that storm lifting over Salt
                   Lake, Clarence?
          
          TEXACO SERVICE MAN is cleaning windshield.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Unlikely, Victor. I just reviewed the Area
                   Report for 1609 hours through 2400 hours.
                   That's an occluded front stalled over the
                   Dakotas -- backed up all the way to Utah.
          
          Texaco Service Man opens hood and checks dipstick.
          
                                  BASTA
                   If it decides to push over into the Great
                   Lakes it could get plenty soupy. How about
                   the southern route, around Tulsa?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   I double checked the terminal forecast and
                   winds aloft. IFR ceilings all the way.
          
          Oveur gives charge card to Texaco Man.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Where do they top out?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Well, there's some light scattered cover
                   at twenty thousand with icing around
                   eighteen.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Looks like the original flight plan over
                   Denver is still the best bet.
          
          Oveur signs charge form and gives it to Texaco Man.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Denver it is.

                   How do you do, Roger?

                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I didn't go there that night to fall in
                   love, I just dropped in for a couple of
                   drinks.
          
          BACK TO STRIKER
          
          He turns to look toward dance floor.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   But suddenly there she was.
          
          STRIKER'S POV
          
          Elaine dancing with grizzly looking cutthroat.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I was captivated, entranced.
          
          BACK TO STRIKER
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   It hit me like a thunderbolt. I had to ask
                   the guy next to me to pinch me to make
                   sure I wasn't dreaming.
          
          Striker asks the burly LONGSHOREMAN next to him to to pinch
          him. Longshoreman gives him a look and moves away
          cautiously.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I was afraid to approach her, but that
                   night, fate was on my side.
          
          Elaine's dancing partner is stabbed in the back and falls to
          the grould. No one notices but Striker who eagerly fills in.
          They make a perfect disco couple. The other dancers make a
          circle around them.
          
          They begin with fancy disco steps, move on to flips and
          seemingly impossible acrobatics, finally ending with
          incredible stunts: Striker, jumping through flaming hoops
          and Elaine, hanging from a chandelier by her teeth and
          twirling.

          INT. MAGUMBA BAR DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
          
          Bar is closing, chairs on tables, bartender sweeping floor,
          Elaine and Striker dancing slowly in center of room. One
          final Girl Scout flies into FRAME and falls in a lifeless
          heap at their feet.

                                  STRIKER
                   We laughed, we talked, we danced, I never
                   wanted it to end and I guess I still
                   don't. But enough about me. I hope this
                   hasn't been boring for you.
          
          CAMERA WIDENS to reveal Mrs. Elderly's legs dangling next to
          him. She has hung herself.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   It's just that when I start to talk about
                   Elaine, I get so carried away -- I lose
                   all track of time -- not unlike Oliver in
                   'Jesus: the Man.'

          Milton, carrying a tray with two cups of coffee, approaches
          Bernice.
          
                                  MILTON
                   I happened to be passing, and I thought
                   you might like some corfee.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   That's very nice of you. Thank you.
          
          She takes a cup.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Ah, won't you sit down?
          
                                  MILTON
                   Thank you. Cream?
          
                                  BERNICE
                   No, thank you. I take it black. Like my
                   men.
          
                                  MILTON
                   Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You
                   see, I'm a teacher in the New York City
                   school system, and I was attending a
                   seminar on visual aids to education. Are
                   you from L.A.?
          
                                  MILTON
                   No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a
                   lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's
                   Assocation.

          Elaine is taking orders from a couple and their eight year
          old son.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Would you like to order dinner now?
          
                                  MR. HAMMEN
                   Yes. Steak for Joey and my wife and I will
                   have the fish.
          
                                  JOEY
                   When can I see the cockpit, Dad?
          
                                  MR. HAMMEN
                   Well, I think that the pilots are too busy
                   flying the plane for that, Joey.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Aw, gee whiz.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I tell you what, Joey. I'll talk to the
                   Captain and see what I can arrange.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Gee! That'd be swell!
          
          Elaine moves on to the two Black Dudes.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Would you gentlemen care to order your
                   dinners?
          
          The Black Dudes point to their selections on the menu.

                   May I take your dinner order?
          
                                  HARI KRISHNA #1
                   No, thank you, we brought our own
                   vegetables.
          
                                  HARI KRISHNA #2

          Boring another passenger.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY
          
          Striker and Elaine are running. She falls down at the
          water's edge, exhausted. Striker drops to his knees and they
          embrace passionately. A huge wave washes over them covering
          them completely. When the wave recedes, they're still locked
          in the same embrace. They are covered with seaweed. Fish are
          flopping around in the sand.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Oh, Ted, I never knew I could be so happy.
                   These past few months have been wonderful.
                   Tomorrow why don't we drive up the coast
                   to that little seafood place and...
          
          Striker frowns.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   What's the matter?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   My orders came through. My squadron ships
                   out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very
                   important mission.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about
                   you so much.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I love you, Elaine.

                   I love you.
          
          They embrace. Another huge wave washes in and covers them
          completely.

                   Hi.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   This is Captain Oveur. Mister Murdock and
                   Mister Johnson. This is Joey Hammen.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Come on up here. You can see better.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Joey, here's something we give our special
                   visitors. Would you like to have it?
          
          He gives Joey a small toy airplane and puts his arm around
          him.
          
                                  JOEY

                   Have you ever been in a cockpit before?
          
                                  JOEY
                   No, sir. I've never been up in a plane
                   before.

                                  ELAINE
                   We'd better get back now.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd
                   like to.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Could I?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Okay, if you don't get in the way.
          
          Elaine exits. Murdock picks up phone.

          Joey has been paying very close attention to Murdock, and
          suddenly recognizes him.
          
                                  JOEY

                                  MURDOCK
                   I'm sorry, son, but you must have me
                   confused with someone else. My name is
                   Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
          
          He turns to Basta.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Ah, Victor, why don't you get the
                   coordinates on the altitude vector and
                   find out the ratio of direct velocity over
                   engine speed?
          
          Victor is puzzled.

                   I think you should go back to your seat
                   now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him
                   stay up here.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   All right. But just remember, my name is
                   Roger Murdock.
          
          He points to his nametag.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   I'm an airline pilot.
                        (to Oveur)
                   Ah, Clarence, according to my
                   calculations, with this tailwind we ought
                   to be able to make up an additional
                   fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
          
                                  JOEY
                   I think you're the greatest. But my Dad
                   says you don't work hard enough on
                   defense.

                   during the playoffs.

                   buns every night.
          
          Murdock realizes he has given himself away. He quickly looks
          to see if Oveur is listening. Oveur is busy checking
          instruments. Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers
          angrily.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Listen, kid, I've been hearing that crap
                   ever since I was at UCLA. Tell your old
                   man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down
                   the court for forty-eight minutes.
                        (into mike)

                   Elaine, just hear me out. I know things
                   haven't been right for a long time. But it
                   will be different...like it was in the
                   beginning. Remember?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I remember everything. All I have are
                   memories.
          
          Soft MUSIC begins.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Mostly I remember...the nights when we
                   were together. I remember how you used to
                   hold me...and how I used to sit on your
                   face and wriggle...and then afterwards how
                   we'd watch until the sun came up. When it
                   did, it was almost like...like each new
                   day was created...only for us.
          
                                  STRIKER

                   It's a big building where the generals
                   meet. But that's not important right now.
                   They've cleared you of any blame for what
                   happened on that raid. Isn't that good

          Stewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer
          around corners and over seat backs. A man's head peers
          upside down from the TOP OF THE FRAME.
          
                                  RANDY

          As singing continues, Shirley and Jack look at each other
          with saccherine smiles, the Hammens do the same, then the
          Krishnas, then the Black Dudes. Finally, everyone is smiling

                         guitar)
                   'And I wanted to know if life had a
                   purpose, and what it all means in the end.
                   In the silence I listened to the voices
                   inside me, and they told me again and
                   again.'

                   one sea.'
          
          Randy, in her growing enthusiasm, swings her guitar,
          knocking the I.V. connection tube from Lisa's arm. The I.V.
          squirts, and Lisa turns pale and hollow­cheeked. No one else
          notices.
          
                                  RANDY

                   the Father, we are the son.'
          
          Randy again knocks I.V. from Lisa's arm with guitar as the
          passengers start to get into the music.
          
                                  RANDY

          Mrs. Davis rushes to reconnect Lisa's I.V. Lisa doesn't
          react. Mrs. Davis pounds Lisa's chest.

          Davis on the head.

                                  MURDOCK
                   Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff
                   ahead of us. It might get rough again
                   unless we can climb on top. But our
                   airspeed is holding steady at six hundred
                   ten knots.

                   That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen
                   asked me if you would autograph this

                                  STRIKER
                   After the war, I just wanted to get as far
                   away from things as possible. So Elaine
                   and I joined the Peace Corps. We were
                   assigned to an isolated tribe, the
                   Molombos.

          Striker and Elaine are being escorted to the chief's hut by
          two GUARDS. We hear Jungle Animal SOUNDS. The chief is
          standing in front of his hut surrounded by several TRIBESMEN
          who are making the jungle animal sounds.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   They had never seen Americans before.
          
          When Striker and Elaine arrive, the CHIEF holds up his hands
          and the sounds stop.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   At first, they didn't know what to think
                   of us; but soon we gained their trust.
          
          The Chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake.
          Striker shows him power grip. When the Chief is pleased,
          Striker gives him five. The Chief pauses then decks Striker.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   It really was a challenge during the year

          Elaine is having a Supperware party for native women.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Also, Supperware products are ideal for
                   storing leftovers to help stretch your

                   container with a special "Close-M-Tite"
                   lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and
                   prevents sugared cereals from sticking.
          
          She scoops a ladle of corn mush from a carved wooden bowl
          into a Supperware container.

                   "Freez-o-leer".
          
          When she burps the lid, the Supperware makes a human burp
          SOUND.

          Striker nailing crude basketball rim and net to tree.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   You must understand that these people had
                   been completely isolated from
                   civilization.
          
          Striker demonstrates a two-handed set shot to natives. He
          misses.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   No one had ever outlined a physical
                   fitness program for them and they had no
                   athletic equipment.
          
          Native examines basketball for first time. After two slow
          dribbles, he gracefully feints lefts, then, dribbling
          through his legs, sinks a two-hand, over-the-head, reverse
          dunk shot.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   We also emphasized nutrition and taught
                   them to watch their diets.
          
          Another native hits a long jump shot.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   The exercise improved their physical
                   fitness and condition.
          
          One shot after another swishes through the basketball rim.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   My working with them seemed to reinforce
                   our objectives of group cooperation and
                   controlled-competitive activity.
          
          Striker approaches Elaine who is standing on the sideline.
          As they talk, the natives are passing the ball around and
          shooting baskets Harlem Globetrotter fashion.

                   When we re-enlist I'll teach them
                   baseball!
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time
                   for us to go back home -- to the plans we
                   made before the war.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   A lot of people made plans before the war.
                   Like George Zipp.
          
          Elaine walks away, dejectedly. CAMERA STAYS with Striker as
          he pours Gator-Ade into a glass.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I guess it was at that moment that I first
                   realized Elaine had doubts about our
                   relationship. And that as much as anything
                   else led to my drinking problem.
          
          Striker has a problem drinking. He raises his glass of
          Gator-Ade, then suddenly pours it on his forehead.

                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Yes. Yes, of course.

          Rumack and Elaine enter. Rumack stoops over to Shirley, and
          surgical instrument is slapped into his hand from o.s. He
          pokes her stomach with his hand.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Pain there?
          
          She winces and nods.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   May I see your tongue, please?
          
          She sticks her tongue out. Rumack pulls on it until it is
          obviously too long. He continues to pull, and the tongue
          becomes multi-colored magician's scarves. Then he pulls out
          a bouquet of flowers followed by a white dove.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   I'll be back in a minute.
          
          Rumack takes Elaine aside.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   You'd better tell the Captain. We've got
                   to land as soon as we can. This woman has
                   to be gotten to a hospital.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   A hospital? What is it?
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   It's a big building with patients. But
                   that's not important right now. Tell the
                   Captain I must speak to him.

          INT. COCKPIT - CO-PILOT'S SEAT - NIGHT
          
          SOUND of rushing air as instantly inflatable balloon pilot
          takes shape in seat with hands on wheel. His uniform and cap
          are painted on, and he has an alert "leave the driving to
          us" expression on his face. The plane immediately regains
          level flight, and Elaine and Rumack sigh in relief.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   I'll get back to the passengers.
          
          Rumack exits.

                   This is Elaine Dickinson. I'm the
                   stewardess. Captain Oveur is passed out on
                   the floor, and we've lost the co-pilot and
                   navigator, too. We're in terrible trouble.
                   Over.

                   Now listen carefully. Is the automatic
                   pilot on? Over.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Yes. Yes, it is. Over.
          
                                  OVEUR (o.s.)
                   Huh?
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Very good. Now, Elaine, where are you?

                   All right, Elaine. Just hold on. We'll be
                   back to you in a minute.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal dispatch is a beehive of
          activity. The Chief Dispatcher, STEVE McCROSKEY, is barking
          orders to AIR CONTROLLER #1.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Hold all takeoffs. I don't want another
                   plane in the air. When the 508 reports,
                   bring it straight in.
          
          Air Controller #1 exits quickly. McCroskey picks up phone.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Put out a general bulletin to suspend all
                   meal service on flights out of Los
                   Angeles.
          
          He hangs up phone and talks to AIR CONTROLLER #2.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Tell all dispatchers to remain at their
                   posts. It's going to be a long night.
          
          Air Controller #2 exits. McCroskey notices he is out of
          coffee and turns to AIR CONTROLLER HINSHAW.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   And how about some coffee, Johnny?
          
                                  HINSHAW
                   No thanks.
          
          AIR CONTROLLER #3 enters.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   I want the weather on every landing field
                   on this side of the Rockies, no matter
                   what the size.
          
          Air Controller #3 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #4 enters.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Do you understand?
          
          Air Controller #4 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #5 enters.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Any place where there's a chance to land
                   this plane.
          
          Air Controller #5 exits. SIAMESE TWINS enter.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Stan, go upstairs to the tower and get a
                   runway diagram. Terry, check down on the
                   field for emergency equipment.
          
          Siamese Twins leave. In the b.g. we see them trying to walk
          in opposite directions. Air Controller #1 enters.
          
                                  AIR CONTROLLER #1
                   Chief, there's fog down to the deck
                   everywhere east of the Rockies. There's no
                   possible place they can land. They'll have
                   to come through to Chicago.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit
                   smoking.
          
          He lights up a cigarette. McCroskey walks toward a table and
          leans on his hands.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   I want the best available man on this. A
                   man who knows this plane inside and out
                   and won't crack under pressure.
          
                                  HINSHAW
                   How about Sal Mineo?

                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is
                   the air speed gauge. What speed does it
                   indicate?

          slowly beginning to deflate.
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Good. Now check your altitude. That's the
                   dial just below and to the right of the
                   air speed indicator.

                                  ELAINE
                   No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand
                   feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast!
                   Why is it doing that?
          
          By now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is
          quite deflated. It is staring at her with a half smile.
          Elaine notices it.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Oh, my God! The automatic pilot! It's

                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   All right, Elaine, don't worry. We have an
                   auxiliary inflation system. Just follow my
                   instructions.
          
                                  ELAINE

                   Now, Elaine, don't panic. On the belt line
                   of the automatie pilot there is a hollow
                   tube. Can you see that?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Yes. Yes, I can see it.
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Good. Now that's the manual inflation
                   nozzle. Pull it out and blow it up like a
                   balloon.
          
          Elaine kneels over automatic pilot's crotch, puts tube in
          her mouth and blows. Automatic pilot inflates. Rumack bursts

                   I think you ought to know what our chances
                   are. The life of everyone on board depends

                   This is due to periodic air pockets we
                   encounter. There is no reason to become
                   alarmed, and we hope you enjoy the rest of
                   your flight. By the way, is there anyone
                   on ­board who knows how to fly a plane?

                                  CAREY
                        (holding off dog)
                   Well, to tell the truth, they really
                   didn't fill me in on many of the details.
                   Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Something about a plane with no pilot?
          
          Carey begins to lose battle with the dog, while trying to
          remain polite.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Yeah, something like that, but as I say,
                   they didn't have time to tell me very
                   much.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting
                   things happen all the time down there.
          
          Shep is growling and Carey's arm is locked firmly in his
          Jaws.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Well...the airline business...does have...
                   its moments...
          
          Shep pins Carey against the wall, ripping his sleeve.
          
                                  CAREY
                   ...but after...awhile...you begin to...
                        (gasp)
                   ...get used to it.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Shep, no! He gets so excited when new
                   people are here.
          
          We hear a THUD and loud growling.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Are you a pilot yourself?
          
          Carey is on the floor desperately fighting off the dog,
          which is on top of him.
          
                                  CAREY
                   I'm...in a...argh...navigator training
                   program.
          
          KRAMER enters, buttoning his coat.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   It's unbelievable! How many times have I
                   warned those people about food inspection?
          
          Kramer is tying his tie in the mirror. In the corner of the
          mirror, Carey is being thrashed by the dog.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   The airport management, the F.A.A., and
                   the airlines, they're all cheats and
                   liars! All right, let's get out of here.

                   Sorry to bother you. We were just looking
                   for someone with flying experience.
          
          Randy exits. They return to reading their PLAYRAMA magazine
          with a female Hari Krishna in a sexy pose on the cover.

          Striker is sitting next to a MAN FROM INDIA in a business
          suit and turban.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   You see, the day we left the village it
                   was raining, so we had to take a special
                   jeep to the main road...
          
          The Indian is dousing himself with a can of gasoline. In
          b.g. Randy is talking to passengers.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep
                   since just the day before the only one we
                   had broke down -- it had a bad axle...
          
          The Indian lights a match to immolate himself. Randy
          approaches.
          
                                  RANDY
                   Excuse me, sir. There's been a little
                   problem in the cockpit and I was
                   wondering...
          
                                  STRIKER
                   The cockpit? What is it?
          
                                  RANDY
                   It's the little room at the front of the
                   plane where the pilots sit. But that's not
                   important right now. The first officer is
                   ill and the Captain would like someone
                   with flying experience to help him with
                   the radio. Do you know anything about
                   planes?
          
          The Indian holds the match, awaiting the outcome.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Well, I flew in the war, but that was a
                   long time ago. I wouldn't know anything
                   about it.
          
                                  RANDY
                   Would you go up, please?
          
          He has a moment of indecision. The Indian encourages Striker
          with an adamant nod. Striker gets up to leave. The Indian,
          relieved, blows out the match.

          Jack is sitting across the aisle from a 65-year-old
          con­servatively dressed SPINSTER. He pulls a flask from his
          coat pocket and takes a swig. She eyes him dis­approvingly.
          
                                  JACK
                   Would ya like a little whiskey, ma'am?

                   Certainly not.

          Empty pilot's seat and inflated automatic pilot.

                   Both pilots!
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Can you fly this airplane and land it?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Surely you can't be serious.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!
                   What flying experience have you had?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the
                   Air Force, but this plane has four
                   engines. It's an entirely different kind
                   of flying...all together!!!
          
                                  RANDY/RUMACK
                        (all together)
                   It's an entirely different kind of flying.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Besides, I haven't touched any ­kind of
                   plane in six years.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Mister Striker. I know nothing about
                   flying. All I know is this: you're the
                   only person on this plane who can possibly
                   fly it. You're the only chance we've got.

          Kramer and a mutilated Carey are en route to airport. Kramer

                        (into phone)
                   No, we can't do that; the risk of a
                   flameout is too great. Keep him 24,000.
                   No, feet!
          
          He hangs up phone.

                   One of the passengers is going to land
                   that plane.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Is that possible?
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot.
                   Thousand to one. I know this guy.
          
                                  CAREY
                   You do? Who is it?
          
          We hear A THUNK. REAR PROJECTION shows he has run oyer a
          bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him
                   during the war. And that won't make my job
                   any easier tonight.
          
          REAR PROJECTION SPEEDS UP to obvious FAST MOTION.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up
                   to a point. But he was one of those men
                   who, well, let's just say he felt too much
                   inside. Maybe you know the kind.
          
          Now REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then
          weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   It takes a certain type to perform under
                   pressure. Striker didn't have it.
          
          By now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback
          chasing and shooting at Kramer's car.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Ate his heart out over every name on the
                   casualty lists. The upshot of it is that
                   he went all to pieces on one particular
                   mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen
                   again tonight.

                                  STRIKER
                   That's what I've been trying to tell these
                   people.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently,
                   so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on
                   this plane is in a desperate situation.
                   Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the
                   thrust, this must turn on the landing
                   lights.
          
          He flips a switch. The plane dives.

                   Yeah, I was just trying out the landing

                   This guy doing the flying has no airline
                   experience at all. He'll be a menace to

                        (he pauses to listen)
                   ...Yes, birds too.

                   Okay, okay. He's a terrible risk, but what
                   other choice have we got?
          
          McCroskey hangs up phone.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Well, that's the whole story, Rex,
                   everything we know.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.
          
          Kramer whips off his sunglasses. Underneath is another pair
          of sunglasses.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   As you know, I flew with this man,
                   Striker, during the war. He'll have enough
                   on his mind without remembering those days
                   when -- well, when things weren't so good.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Well, right now things aren't so good. And
                   while we're talking there are a hundred
                   and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a
                   decision.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker
                   was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long
                   time ago...
          
          A spear slams into the wall behind Kramer.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   ...but my feeling is that when the going
                   gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's
                   gonna fold up.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn
                   and talk this guy down! You're going to
                   have to let him get the feel of this
                   airplane on the way; you'll have to talk
                   him onto the approach; and so help me,
                   you'll have to talk him right down to the
                   ground!
          
          A watermelon falls from TOP OF FRAME, splattering on the
          table.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Very well then. Put Striker on the
                   speaker.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Okay, you can use the radio over there.
                   Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit
                   drinking.

                        (dramatically)
                   Yes, Captain Kramer. Read you loud and
                   clear.
          
          INT. DISPATCH - NIGHT
          
          Kramer sits at the mike. An Air Controller is standing next
          to him, but only his mid-section is in FRAME.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right. It's obvious you remember me.
          
          The Air Controller is scratching his behind.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   So what do you say you and I just forget
                   about everything except what we have to do
                   now?
          
          The Air Controller is now scratching his crotch.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   You and I are going to bring this plane in
                   together.
          
          The Air Controller's hand is now inside his pants
          straightening out his underwear.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Before we start, I'd like to say
                   something. I know that right now things
                   must look pretty rough up there.
          
          The Air Controller is now hopping around with both hands
          inside his pants.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   But if you do what I tell you, when I tell
                   you to do it, there's no reason you can't
                   bring that plane in.

                                  STRIKER
                   Let's not kid each other, Kramer. You know
                   I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm
                   going to need all the luck there is.

                   Stand by, Striker.
                        (to McCroskey)
                   The one hope we have is to build this man
                   up. I've got to give him all the
                   confidence I can.
                        (into microphone)
                   All right, Striker, have you ever flown a
                   multi-engine plane before?
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   No. Never.
          
                                  KRAMER

                   This is a goddamn waste of time. There's
                   no way he can land this plane! Route 'em
                   into Lake Michigan and at least avoid
                   killing innocent people!

                   Grab hold of yourself! You've got to talk
                   them down. You're the only chance they've
                   got!
          
          Kramer lights cigarette.
          
                                  KRAMER
                        (into mike)
                   All right, Striker, now you listen to me
                   and you listen close. Flying is no
                   different than riding a bicycle...it just
                   happens to be a lot harder to put baseball
                   cards in the spokes. Now, if you just
                   follow my instructions...
          
          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
          
          Two vultures are sitting on back of Striker's seat.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   ...there's no reason why you shouldn't
                   have complete confidence in your chances
                   to come out of this thing alive and in one
                   piece.
          
          INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT
          
                                  KRAMER
                   First, I want you to familiarize yourself
                   with the controls. Later we'll run through
                   the landing procedure.
          
          Kramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out
          the window. McCroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and
          ducks as though Kramer had thrown a grenade. There is an
          EXPLOSION O.S.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right. Now I'd like you to disengage
                   the automatic pilot. But watch any violent
                   movement of the controls, like you used to
                   make in Spitfires and Phantoms.
          
          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
          
                                  STRIKER
                        (into microphone)
                   Okay, I'm going to unlock the automatic
                   pilot.
          
          Striker switches off automatic pilot button. Automatic pilot
          shoots upward out of the seat. Elaine is thrown to the
          floor. Striker struggles desperately to control the plane.

                        (matter of factly)
                   Just remember, the controls will feel very
                   heavy compared to a fighter.
          
          Striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is
          drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the
          rear of the cockpit.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   Don't worry about that. It's perfectly
                   normal. You must watch your airspeed
                   closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both
                   your rudder pedals and elevator trim will
                   have additional play due to increased
                   drag, but you can compensate by lowering
                   manifold pressure below 154. Now there's
                   one other thing. Have you someone up there
                   who can work the radio and leave you free
                   for flying?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Yes! The stewardess is here with me!
          
          Elaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands
          clinging to her breasts. She removes it and seats it at
          engineer's console.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   Have her take the co-pilot's seat.
          
          Elaine takes her seat as Striker regains control of the
          plane. He hands Elaine the mike.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye
                   on that number three engine. It's running
                   a little hot.

                   How's it handling?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

                   All right, Striker, you're doing just
                   fine.

          MRS. SCHIFF, a middle-aged woman, is seated behind the Black
          Dudes.
          
                                  MRS. SCHIFF
                   Oh, stewardess, I can speak jive. He said
                   he's in great pain and wants to know if
                   you can help him.

          He reaches up and opens the overhead air nozzle. Air rushes
          out with hurricane force. As Jack struggles to turn off
          nozzle, Shirley is blown about, an adjacent passenger's
          papers go flying from a briefcase, a Hari Krishna's toga
          flies up revealing polka dot boxer shorts. An extra's toupe
          flies off.

                                  MILTON
                   After my wife died, I felt like a fifth
                   wheel. You know, so many years being with
                   one person -- a very wonderful person --
                   makes you always think of yourself as part
                   of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was
                   lost. I couldn't function socially and I
                   couldn't function in business.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't
                   be expected to.
          
                                  MILTON
                   But I think it's time we stopped talking
                   about me. A woman like you -- why haven't
                   you ever married?
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's
                   all too easy to answer.
          
                                  MILTON
                   I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman
                   like you became so involved in your work,
                   you didn't have time for marriage.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   I wish I could fool myself into believing
                   that that's the reason. The truth of the
                   matter is, nobody ever asked me.
          
                                  MILTON
                   You know, here we are having coffee
                   together, and discussing education and
                   business and economy...and we don't even
                   know each other's names...full names I
                   mean.

                   I'd be glad to.
          
          Randy hands a large bottle of Coca Cola wrapped in a baby
          blanket to Ms. Schiff, who cradles it in her arms.
          
                                  MRS. SCHIFF
                   Ooooh, such a nice soft drink.

          The Dispatcher attempts to remove the message, but it is
          stuck in the cartridge. He yanks on it, but the paper
          stretches out like rubber. The scene now becomes like a
          cartoon. He lodges his feet against the typewriter and pulls
          until the paper stretches to his face. He grumbles in Donald
          Duck voice. The typewriter snaps back and hits him.

                                  RANDY
                   Doctor Rumack, I'm scared. I've never been
                   so scared. And besides, I'm twenty-six and
                   I'm not married.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK

                   be landing?
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   It will be pretty soon. How are you
                   bearing up?

                   at least I've got a husband.

                                  McCROSKEY
                   Rex, I've decided that the best thing to
                   do is to foam the runway -- let him do a
                   wheels-up landing. It'd be a lot simpler.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   No, the risk of fire is too great. If she
                   starts burning, you write off all those
                   people who can't get out of there on their
                   own power.
          
          McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   Well that's better than writing them all
                   off? Are you going to play God with a
                   hundred and 38 lives?
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   No. A belly landing isn't all that simple.
                   It takes a good pilot to keep from
                   smearin' himself all over the runway.
          
          McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket as Kramer drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   If Striker has the guts to try this, he
                   deserves the best shot we can give him.
                   We've gotta foam that runway.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks.

                   His only shot's with the wheels down. I've
                   seen foam tear a man's guts out.
          
          McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer throws cup
          into wastebasket.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   And if Striker goes to pieces?
          
                                  KRAMER
                        (taking another cup)
                   That's a risk we'll just have to take.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey throws cup

                   No. I haven't a thing to say. You've done
                   the best you could. You really have. The
                   best you could. I guess we can't expect to
                   win 'em all. I want to tell you something
                   I've kept to myself for years. I was in
                   the war myself -- the Medical Corps. I was
                   on duty late one night when a badly
                   wounded pilot was brought in from a raid.
                   He could barely talk, but he looked at me
                   and he said, "Doc. The odds were against
                   us up there but we went in anyway, and I'm
                   glad we did. The captain made the right
                   decision." The pilot's name was George
                   Zipp.
          
          Striker looks up. Notre Dame Fight Song is heard in b.g.

                                  DR. RUMACK
                   And the last thing he said to me, "Doc,"
                   he said, "Sometime when the crew is up
                   against it and the breaks are beating the
                   boys, tell them to go out there with all
                   they've got and win just one for the
                   Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then,
                   Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too
                   good. That's for sure."

                   All right, you'd better stay up there for

          She turns to face him. A dramatic moment. Striker enters

                   put down full flap, bring your air speed
                   back to a hundred and thirty-five, then I

                   There's a slight crosswind from the right,
                   so be ready for it.

                   If that doesn't stop you...
          
          Kramer is suddenly aware of what Mrs. Oveur is doing. He
          gives her a look and she removes her hands.
          
                                  KRAMER

          PLANE

                   ...Lonliness, that's the bottom line. I
                   was never happy as a child. Christmas,
                   Ted, what does it mean to you? For me, it
                   was a living hell. Do you know what it's
                   like to fall in the mud and get kicked? In
                   the head? By an iron boot? Of course you
                   don't. No one does. That never happens.
                   Sorry, Ted. Dumb question. Strike that.

                   I didn't know that the electric eel was
                   approaching so rapidly nor that hidden in
                   the coral reef was a family of poisonous
                   sea urchins.
          
          EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

                        (into mike)
                   ...and they shall be for frontlets between

          ROMANTIC MUSIC.
          
          Striker and Elaine are alone on the runway. Behind them is
          flight 209. They embrace and kiss as CAMERA ARCS around.
          MUSIC SWELLS. Suddenly the ENGINES REV UP. Astonished, they
          look up to the cockpit.
          
          EXT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
          
          Automatic pilot is at controls. He salutes Striker and
          Elaine and winks at CAMERA.
          
          EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT
          
          The plane begins to taxi on its belly, shooting off sparks
          and making a tremendous scraping SOUND. Arm in arm, Striker
          and Elaine wave good-bye as the plane takes off into the
          night sky.
          
          
                                                       FADE OUT.

					UNTITLED

	1	FADE IN								1

	A close-shot of a yellow legal tablet.  A young hand comes
	into frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only
	the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written
	in a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and
	corrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of
	an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we
	now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song."

	2	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY					2

	A lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky.  Behind
	it, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of
	San Diego.  A dry, hot Southern California day.  Even the wind
	is lazy, and a little bored.

	3	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER - DAY				3

	Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he
	collects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the
	Southland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly
	thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.

	Turning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.
	She is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's

	Having with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They
	stand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the
	highly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering
	fake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the
	commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual
	conversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing
	letters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY...
	now he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always
	pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.

					ELAINE
			Excuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no
			word in The English Language -- "Xmas."
			It's either Merry Christmas... or Happy
			Holidays.

	The Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns
	away.  The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs -
	that's my Mom.

	TITLE: 1969

	4	EXT.  MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX -- DAY				4

	This is the new professional-class.  It's a mini-condo
	community.  Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with
	common walls.   Move in on one of these homes, the one without
	Christmas lights.  At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl.
	She checks her cheek, straightens her hair.  She hides
	something under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance
	to enter.  Music fades.

	5	INT. KITCHEN -- DAY						5

	We now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her
	son, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets.
	The meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan.  Across the kitchen
	we see William.  He's a great listener, with a calm and curious
	face that takes everything in.

					WILLIAM
			- so Livia -

					ELAINE
			-- killed everyone off so her son
			Tiberius could inherit the throne.
				(thoughtful pause)
			Just like Nixon.

	William nods, intrigued.  He has a good disposition.  The
	world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings
	out in his Mom.  There is a small clatter at the front door,
	as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes.
	She silently curses herself.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Anita, is that you?

					ANITA'S VOICE
			Hey Mom!  I already ate.

	Mom moves to the living room to greet William's sister.  William
	peers into the next room.

	6	INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY						6

	She's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches
	her.  We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close.  She is an alluring
	young Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.

					ELAINE
			You sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.

	The words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl.

					ANITA
			I'm fine.  Already ate.

	William stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as
	Mom moves closer to his sister.  She sees something curious
	about her daughter.

					ELAINE
			Wait.  You've been kissing.

					ANITA
				(too quickly)
			No I haven't.

					ELAINE
				(peering at her lips)
			Yes... yes, you have...

					ANITA
			No I haven't.

					ELAINE
			Yes you have.  I can tell.

					ANITA
				(boldly)
			You can't tell.

	Mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully.
	To her, everything is a quest for knowledge.

					ELAINE
			Not only can I tell, I know who it is.
			It's Darryl.

	Anita is stunned silent.  She turns slightly to look at herself
	in a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself
	immediately.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			And what have you got under your coat?

	This is the booty Anita didn't want to give up.  Mom picks at
	the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket.
	She withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends.

					ANITA
				(busted)
			It's unfair that we can't listen to
			our music!

					ELAINE
				(weary of the issue)
			Honey, it's all about drugs and
			promiscuous sex.

					ANITA
			Simon and Garfunkel is poetry!

					ELAINE
			Yes it's poetry.  It's the poetry of
			drugs and promiscuous sex.  Look at
			the picture on the cover...

	CLOSE ON BOOKENDS ALBUM COVER

	Mom's fingers at the edges.  We examine the insolent faces on
	Richard Avedon's classic album cover.  Even Simon and Garfunkle
	look guilty under her scholarly inspection.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			... honey, they're on pot.

					ANITA
			First it was butter, then sugar and
			white flour.
				(beat)
			Bacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll,
			motorcycles.

	Nearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating
	conversation.  Anita glances at her brother.  He silently
	urges her to downshift.  She can't.

					ANITA (cont'd)
			Then it was celebrating Christmas on a
			day in September When you knew it
			wouldn't be "commercialized."

					ELAINE
			That was an experiment.  But I
			understand -

					ANITA
			What else are you going to ban?

					ELAINE
			Honey, you want to rebel against
			knowledge.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			I'm trying to give you the Cliff's
			Notes on how to live in this world.

					ANITA
				(simple and direct)
			We're like nobody else I know.

	These are the words that sting Mom most.

					ELAINE
			I'm a teacher.  Why can't I teach my
			own kids?
				(pats chest)
			Use me.

					ANITA
			Darryl says you use knowledge to keep
			me down.  He says I'm a "yes" person
			and you're trying to raise us in a
			"no" environment!

					ELAINE
				(immediately, can't help
			it)
			Well, clearly, "no" is a word Darryl
			doesn't hear much.

	Anita gasps.  Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in.  Nearby
	is a poster - "No More War."

					WILLIAM
			Mom --

					ELAINE
			Everything I say is wrong.

					ANITA
			I can't live here!  I hate you!  Even
			William hates you!

					WILLIAM
			I don't hate her.

					ANITA
				(to William)
			You don't even know the truth!

	William looks vaguely confused.

					ELAINE
			Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen.

	Anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the
	strangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for
	the first time.

					ANITA
			Feck  you!  All of you!

					ELAINE
			Hey!

	Anita runs down the hall to her room.  Elaine turns to William,
	relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Well, there it is.  Your sister using
			the "f" word.

					WILLIAM
			I think she said "feck."

					ELAINE
				(sputtering)
			What's the difference?

					WILLIAM
				(encouraging)
			Well.  The letter "u"...

	Shot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of
	The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin."

	7	INT.   SCHOOL DANCE/GYMNASIUM BATHROOM -- NIGHT			7

	Music continues.  Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking
	male teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror.
	There's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid
	proudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some
	Hai Karate), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the
	face of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and
	then a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down,
	down to find William.  He is so much younger, without a zit in
	sight.  Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.

	8	INT. DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-CRANKED				 8

	Song continues as we see William's perspective of these much-
	older looking kids.  Girls now are visible, and they are even
	more mature than the boys we've just seen.  They flirt and
	glow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys.
	Whispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down.
	It's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring
	world of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Are you really in our grade?

	9	INT. JUNIOR HIGH LOCKER ROOM -- DAY				  9

					VOICE
				(louder)
			Are you really in our grade?

	William turns to see tall, adenoidal TIM TOBIN.  The most mature
	looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud
	theatrical tone.  It is a voice right out of Guys and Dolls,
	which incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just
	starred.  William answers in a respectful voice.  He is
	desperate for acceptance.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					TOBIN
			Hey guys!  Check it out!  William
			doesn't have any pubes!

	Others now begin to gather around, examining William.  He has
	never been more naked.

					GUY # 1
			How old are you man?

					TOBIN
			He's not a man, he's a little baby
			kid.  He Doesn't even get zits yet.

					GUY # 2
			How come you don't have any hair down
			there?

					TOBIN
				(in loud, funny voice)
			Where are your pubes???!!

	Their voices echo off the tiled walls.  Now everyone is watching
	the hairless William.  He is confused by their meanness.

					GUY # 2
			Yeah.  Where are your pubes?

	All eyes are on him, waiting for a response.  The kid's mental
	wheels turn frantically.  And from somewhere comes an attitude,
	a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could
	only be a merciful deity.

					WILLIAM
				(cool, dismissive)
			I had 'em.  I shaved 'em off.

	It is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy.  And it works.
	Guy #2 cracks up, then others.  William's new accuser is
	suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these
	older boys.  Others turn away, on to other things.  Tobin stares
	at William, and then also turns away.

	10    INT. FAMILY CAR -- DAY						10

	William jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan
	station wagon, carrying books.  ("See ya pubes!")  Mom continues
	driving William and Anita home from school.

					ELAINE
				(cheerfully, by rote, to
			William in back)
			Put on your seatbelt.   I don't want
			you flying through the windshield.

	Anita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't
	noticed.

					WILLIAM
			We got our annuals today --

					ELAINE
				(cheerful, automatic)
			"Received" your annual.

					WILLIAM
				(looking at his photo)
			I look so much younger than everyone
			else.

					ELAINE
			Enjoy it while you can.

	Camera drifts from Mom to Anita, who can take it no longer.

					ANITA
			Mom.  It's time.

					ELAINE
				(pleasant, pointed)
			Can this wait until we get home?

					ANITA
			Mom, pull over.  Tell him the truth.
			Tell him how old he is.

	Mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.

					ELAINE
				(as in "be quiet")
			He knows how old he is.

					ANITA
			The other kids make fun of him because
			of How young he looks.  Nobody includes
			him.

	They call him "The Narc" behind his back...

					WILLIAM
			They do?

					ELAINE
			What's a "Narc?"

					ANITA
			(bleeding for her brother)
			A Narcotics Officer!

					ELAINE
			Well what's wrong with that?

					WILLIAM
				(ever the peacemaker)
			Come on you guys.  It's no big deal.
			I'm 12.  It's okay. She skipped me a
			grade, it's okay.  Big deal.   I'm a
			year younger.  They're 13, I'm 12 --
				(beat)
			Aren't I?

	Their silence is eloquent.

					ELAINE
				(confessing, in a rush)
			I also put you in first grade when you
			were five and never told you.

					WILLIAM
				(trembling)
			So...  I'm... how old?

	A heavy quiet.  She and his sister ignore him, as they now
	debate the subject with each other.

					ANITA
			You lied to him!  You make such a big
			deal about the truth and you lied!

					ELAINE
				(that one hurts)
			He never asked.

					ANITA
			What -- like he's going to ask if he's
			as old as he thinks he is?  Don't you
			realize, this is going to scar him
			forever?

					ELAINE
			Honey... sweetheart... don't be
			Cleopatra.  We have to be his mother
			and his Dad.

					ANITA
			You put too much pressure on him!

					WILLIAM
				(apprehensive)
			How... old...

					ANITA
			And when he rebels in some strange and
			odd way, don't blame me.

					WILLIAM
			... am I?

					ELAINE
				(matter of fact)
			I skipped you an extra grade.  You're
			eleven.

					WILLIAM
			(horrified, voice crackling)
			ELEVEN?

	He looks at his body, the information affects him physically.
	New sounds come from way down deep inside.  Mom now begins
	speed-rapping, trying to stem the leak.  She starts the car.

					ELAINE
			So you skipped fifth grade.  There's
			too  much padding In the grades.  I
			taught elementary school.  5th grade -
			unnecessary.  Nothing happens in the
			5th grade.  All Teachers know it, no
			one talks about it.

					WILLIAM
				(still in shock)
			E - leven.

					ELAINE
			And you skipped kindergarten because I
			taught it to you when you were four.

					WILLIAM
			(still horrified, looking
			 at his body)
			This explains... so much...

					ANITA
			You've robbed him of an adolescence!

					ELAINE
			Adolescence is a marketing tool.

					ANITA
			He's got no "crowd"... no friends...

					WILLIAM
			Okay!

	Anita reaches out to her brother.  With the compassion of a
	saint, she offers this:

					ANITA
			Honey, I know you were expecting
			puberty.  You're just going to have to
			shine it on for a while.

	Deeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat.  Mom
	monitors his face constantly.  She is raw and sincere... and
	yes, inspiring:

					ELAINE
			Who needs a "crowd?"  You're unique.  You're
			two years ahead of everybody.  Take those
			extra years and do what you want.  Go to
			Europe for a year!  Take a look around,
			see what you like!  Follow your dream!
			You'll still be the youngest lawyer in the
			country.  Your own great grandfather
			practiced law until he was 93.  Your dad
			was so proud of you.  He knew you were a
			pronominally accelerated child.

					ANITA
			What about me?

					ELAINE
				(heartbroken, can't help
			herself)
			You're rebellious and ungrateful of my
			love.

					ANITA
			Well, somebody's gotta be normal around
			here!

					WILLIAM
				(blinking, still can't
			believe it)
			Eleven.

	11    INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY					11

	William finishes the last of many candy bars.  A mound of
	wrappers sit just below the mirror.  He examines his face
	hopefully for zits.  Nothing coming.  We begin to hear Simon
	and Garfunkel's "America."

	12    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY						12

	Anita stands in the living room.   The song continues playing
	on the stereo.

					ANITA
			I want to play you a song that explains
			why I'm leaving, and try to listen.

					ELAINE
			We can't talk?  We have to listen to
			rock music?

	13    EXT. FRONT LAWN -- DAY						13

	William watches sadly.  Anita's good-looking boyfriend DARRYL,
	a dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases
	into a large turqouise Chevy.  The suitcases are adorned with
	plastic stick-on flowers.    All coolness is leaving William's
	life.  Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless.   (Their house
	is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)

					WILLIAM
			Take good care of her in San Francisco,
			man.

	Darryl gives the kid a sub-human look.  He's invisible, too
	young to converse with.

					ELAINE
			How can she leave such a loving family?

	Anita turns and heads towards them.  She focuses on William,
	placing her hands on his young shoulders.  Her face is very
	close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the
	future.

					ANITA
			One day you'll be cool.

	He nods stoically, hopefully.  He is utterly lost.  She leans
	forward and whispers in his ear.

					ANITA (cont'd)
			Look under your bed.  It'll set you
			free.

	Anita shakes hands with Mom, and exits.  As the car takes off:

					ELAINE
			She'll be back.

	In the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.

					ANITA
			YEAHHHHH-HOOOOOOOO.

					ELAINE
			Maybe not soon...

	William watches wistfully.  He moves away from his mother.
	She pulls him closer.  Shot moves in on his slightly fearful
	face.

	14    INT. DARRYL'S CAR - DAY						14

	Anita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her
	mother and brother.  Sister waves to brother.  She feels for
	him.  Music now shifts to The Who's "Sparks."

	15    INT. BEDROOOM -- NIGHT						15

	William locks the door.  He reaches under his bed.  It's a
	black leatherette travel bag, with tartan design.  He unzips
	the bag -- it's filled with albums.  He flips through the
	amazing, subversive cache of music.  Cream's Wheels of Fire...
	the seminal Bob Dylan bootleg Great White Wonder... the Rolling
	Stones' Get Yer Ya Ya's Out... The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds...
	Abraxas by Santana... Jethro Tull's Stand Up... The Mother's of
	Invention's We're Only In It For The Money...  Led Zeppelin...
	Crosby, Stills and Nash... Miles Davis' Bitches Brew... and
	The Who's Tommy... with a note taped to it.

					ANITA (V.O.)
			"Listen to Tommy with a candle burning
			and you will see your entire future..."

	The heady effect of all these albums registers, as we see him
	lighting a candle.

	TITLE:  1973

	DETAIL SHOT OF NOTEBOOK

	A blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the
	names of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with
	carefully drawn thunderbolts.  Also, the name LESTER BANGS.

	16    INT. JOURNALISM CLASS -- DAY					16

	William, now 15, sits in class with book, Adventures in
	Journalism.  His hair is shoulder-length.  A dedicated teacher,
	PATRICIA DEEGAN, walks the aisles.  Music continues.

	17    EXT. FOOD MACHINES - DAY						17

	William presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from
	a vending container.  He still looks younger than most of the
	students... and these days, especially the girls.

	18    EXT. LUNCH COURT -- DAY						18

	William sits apart from all the others, under a tree.  He reads
	intently, happily, as he eats the orange.  It's a copy of Creem
	Magazine.  Music continues.

	CLOSE ON PHOTOS IN MAGAZINE

	Camera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and
	fashions of the rock heroes of the day.  Ian Anderson of Jethro
	Tull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute.  Neil Young,
	enigmatic with perfectly patched Levis.  The Southern Rock Royalty
	of The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of
	massive stacks of amps.  Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair
	backlit by stage lights.  David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one-
	piece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars.  Pete Townsend
	of the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.

	Drift down to a by-line - by Lester Bangs.

	19    EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY						19

	William walks through the parking lot after school.  Everybody
	now congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their
	own cars.  Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly
	faces smile strangely, laughing.  He takes a few steps and
	looks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing
	something from the high-school marquee.

	HIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE

	which reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)

	All are laughing.  He laughs with them, and turns as his face
	goes slack.  He shrugs, marches on.

	20    EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RADIO STATION -- DAY			20

	The song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by
	a highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the
	greatness of The Guess Who.  He is a ferocious, lumbering, music-
	driven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the
	very brim.  This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a
	then new art-form -- Rock Journalism.  A Disc-jockey with long-
	long hair watches helplessly.  William views all this through a
	glass window.  He stands on the corner of a downtown side
	street, halfway up a steep incline.  He is the only person on
	the streets this early Saturday morning.  Reveal that he is
	watching a live radio show, audible to us through the small
	p.a. speaker overhead.

					DISC-JOCKEY
			Quite an honor to have the World's
			Greatest Rock Critic... and editor of
			Creem Magazine, back Home in San Diego
			for a few days -- Lester Bangs.

					LESTER BANGS
			What is this hippie station?!  Where's
			Iggy Pop?  Don't you have a copy of
			Raw Power?!

					DISC-JOCKEY
			Lester, isn't it a little early for
			this?

	Bangs searches for the album -- vinyl flying everywhere now,
	with no regard for album jackets.

					BANGS
			Found it!!

	21    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY						21

	William watches intently.  Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy
	of Raw Power.   We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the
	Stooges' "Search and Destroy."   A closer shot on William now
	watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside.  Lester does an Iggy
	Pop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot
	hear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the
	other side of this double-glass window.

	22    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATER				22

	Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego
	street.  It's early, the streets are silent.  Bangs is about
	fifteen beer pounds overweight.  His jeans are loose, his
	paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and
	nights spent writing.  In there somewhere is a good-looking
	guy.  His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he
	takes big sweeping steps.

					BANGS
			So you're the one who's been sending
			me those articles from your school
			newspaper -

					WILLIAM
			I've been doing some stuff for a local
			underground paper, too.

					BANGS
			What are you like the star of your
			school?

					WILLIAM
			They hate me.

					BANGS
			You'll meet them all again on their
			long journey to the middle.

	The kid nods, they walk.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			Well, your writing is damn good.  It's
			just a shame you missed out on rock
			and roll.

					WILLIAM
			I did?

					BANGS
			Oh yeah.  It's over.

					WILLIAM
			Over?

					BANGS
			Over.  You got here just in time for
			the death rattle, the last gasp, the
			last grope.

					WILLIAM
			Well.  At least I'm here for that.

	Bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head.  It's
	too late for newcomers.  But if the kid's age is an issue, he
	doesn't mention it.  Like a machine-gun:

					BANGS
			What do you type on?

					WILLIAM
			Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

					BANGS
			You like the new Lou Reed?

					WILLIAM
				(automatic)
			The early stuff.  The new stuff, he's
			trying to be Bowie, he should be
			himself.  I'm not a big Lou man.

					BANGS
			Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and
			Lou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing
			Lou.

					WILLIAM
				(standing his ground)
			If you like Lou.

					BANGS
			Take drugs?

					WILLIAM
			No.

					BANGS
			Smart kid.  I used to do speed and
			sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night
			writing and writing, like 25 pages of
			dribble about, you know, the Guess
			Who, or Coltrane, just to write, you
			know, with the music blasting...

					WILLIAM
			Me too.  The writing part...

	For a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest
	thing happens.  Bangs laughs.  It's an odd and charming laugh,
	the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden.  It surprised the kid,
	who smiles back.  Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a
	pleasant but very final nod of the head.

					BANGS
			Well, alright.  It's been nice to meet
			you.  I'll see you around.  Keep sending
			me your stuff.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  See you.

					BANGS
			I can't stand here all day talking to
			my many fans.

	WIDE SHOT - SOLITUDE

	But neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning.
	They stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted
	street.  They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.

	23    INT. DINER -- DAY							23

	William listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich.  His face
	is an open book filling with words.

					BANGS
			-- so anyway, you're from San Diego
			and that's good.  Because once you go
			to L.A., you're gonna have friends
			like crazy but they'll be fake friends,
			they're gonna try to corrupt you.  The
			publicists!  The bands!  You got an
			honest face, they're gonna tell you
			everything.  But you CANNOT make friends
			with the rock stars.

	The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures --
	can I make a note?  Bangs nods.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			Cannot make friends with the rock stars.
				(savage bite)
			That's what's important.  If you're a rock
			journalist, a true journalist -- first you
			will never get paid much.  But you will
			get free records from the record company.

	The kid's eyes widen.  Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal
	writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate
	softie.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			And they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet
			girls... they'll try to fly you places for
			free.... offer you drugs...  I know.  It
			sounds great.  But they are not your
			friends.   These are people who want you
			to write sanctimonious stories about the
			genius of the rock stars and they will
			ruin rock and roll and strangle everything
			we love about it.

	Privately, William thrills.  We.  Our.  It all sounds great to
	him.  He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of
	them.  He madly scribbles.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			They are trying to buy respectability
			for a form that is gloriously and
			righteously -

	The kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			- dumb!  And you're smart enough to
			know that.  And the day it ceases to
			be dumb is the day it ceases to be
			real.  Right?  And then it will just
			Become an Industry of Cool.

					WILLIAM
			... Industry... of... cool...

					BANGS
			And that's what they want!  And it's
			happening right now.  I'm telling you,
			you're coming along at a very dangerous
			time for rock and roll.  The war is
			over.  They won.  99% of what passes
			for rock now... SILENCE is much more
			compelling.  It's over.  I think you
			should turn around and go back and
			be... a lawyer or something... but I
			can see from your face that you won't.
			I can pay you thirty-five bucks.  Gimme
			a thousand words on Black Sabbath.

					WILLIAM
				(attempting cool)
			An assignment.

					LESTER
			Yeah.  And you should build your
			reputation on being honest... and
			unmerciful.

					WILLIAM
				(writing in notebook)
			Honest... unmerciful...

					BANGS
			And if you get into a jam -- call me.
			I stay up late.

	Bangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he
	scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate
	notebook.  The notebook has just become valuable.  They sit
	together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.

	24    INT. FAMILY CAR -- NIGHT						24

	Mom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena.  She looks
	out the window at the adrenalized concert-goers.  She feels
	protective not just of her son, but an entire generation.
	William goes over his questions for Black Sabbath.

					ELAINE
			Look at this.  An entire generation of
			Cinderellas and there's no slipper
			coming.

	William looks out the window at the sign: TONIGHT - SOLD OUT -
	BLACK SABBATH with special guest Stillwater.

					WILLIAM
			You can drop me off here.

					ELAINE
			Black.  Sabbath.  Just remember - you
			wanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill
			a Mockingbird.

	The kid doesn't answer.  He silently goes over his questions.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			As long as I know this is just a hobby,
			I'll go along with it.

					WILLIAM
			All I have to do is listen.  That's
			what Lester Bangs said.

					ELAINE
				(dryly)
			I'll be waiting right here at eleven
			'o clock sharp.  If you get lost, use
			the family whistle.

	He unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange
	canvas shoulder-bag and exits.

	Elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert
	crowd.  It's a windy night.  Everything about this image
	troubles her.  She fights with herself, and then uses the family
	whistle immediately.  He turns.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
				(sweetly, too loud)
			Don't take drugs!!

	Fifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound
	of a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her
	concern.  All around him, we hear:

					HAPPY CONCERT GOERS
			Don't take drugs!!

	He winces, nods and moves forward.  Music echoes from the open
	windows of many other cars.

	25    EXT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA BACKSTAGE RAMP -- NIGHT		 25

	The kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel
	backstage arena door.  He rings the buzzer.  The door wheezes
	open to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's
	backstage list.  Famous to all those who attempt to enter,
	this is SCOTTY.  He is a wiry, humorless man for whom
	powerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few
	hours he controls the list.  Scotty is only forty but everything
	about him screams that he's an angry sixty.

					WILLIAM
			Hi.  I'm William Miller and I'm here
			from Creem Magazine to interview the
			band Black Sabbath.

	Scotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and
	snaps through three clipboard pages.  He moves back to the
	door and grabs the handle.

					SCOTTY
			Not on the list.

	He shuts the door with finality.  The kid stands silently for
	a moment.  He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering
	Groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp.  They
	look at him sympathetically, but he turns away.  William rings
	the buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of Creem from his bag.
	The door opens.

					WILLIAM
			Sir, I'm a journalist, and here's a
			copy of the magazine.

	The magazine hangs in mid-air.

					SCOTTY
			You're not on the list.   Go to the
			top of the ramp with the girls!

	Slam.  William stands there for a moment.  Unsure of what to
	do next, he looks back to the top of the ramp.  Rejected by
	him just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest.
	Bracing himself, William rings again.  The door opens slowly
	this time.  Scotty stands peering at him.

					WILLIAM
				(in a rush)
			What-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of-
			the-ramp with-the-gi -

	Slam.  Lock.

	26    EXT. TOP OF SPORTS ARENA RAMP -- NIGHT				26

	William inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the
	ramp.  The wind whips.  It's just him, and two Groupies in
	their evening best.  They now pretend to barely notice the
	young journalist who has been banished to stand with them.
	Chattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17
	years, is ESTRELLA.  She sports long unruly black hair.  Her
	partner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes.  Estrella turns
	to the kid with great disinterest.

					ESTRELLA
			Who are you with?

					WILLIAM
				(embarrassed to be alive)
			Me?  I'm with myself.

					ESTRELLA
			No, who are you with?  What band?

					WILLIAM
			I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
				(beat)
			I'm a journalist.  I'm not a... you
			know...

	Estrella stares at him.  Moving into the parking lot light,
	introducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur
	trimmed coat.  This is PENNY LANE.  There is an inviting warmth
	and real interest in the way she asks:

					PENNY LANE
			... you're not a what?

					WILLIAM
				(enthralled)
			Oh... I'm just... not a... you know.

					PENNY LANE
			Not a "what"?

					WILLIAM
				(charmed)
			You know.  A "groupie."

	The two girls are deeply insulted by the word.

					ESTRELLA
			Ohhh!

					WILLIAM
			Sorry, I -

					PENNY LANE
			We.  Are not.  "Groupies."

	Estrella indicates Penny with great reverence.

					ESTRELLA
			This is Penny Lane, man.  Show some
			respect.

					WILLIAM
			-- sorry.

	Penny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid.  Behind
	her, concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way.  She seems
	not to hear them.

					PENNY LANE
			"Groupies" sleep with rock stars because
			they want to be near someone famous.
			We are here because of the music.  We
			are Band Aids.

					ESTRELLA
			She used to run a school for Band Aids.

					PENNY LANE
			We don't have intercourse with these
			guys.  We support the music.  We inspire
			the music.  We are here because of the
			music.

	William is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window.
	Listening.

					ESTRELLA
			Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.  It's
			famous.

					PENNY LANE
			It's a long story.  I'm retired now.
			I'm just visiting friends.

					ESTRELLA
			She was the one who changed everything.
			She said "no more sex, no more
			exploiting our bodies and hearts... "

					WILLIAM
			Right.  Right.

					ESTRELLA
			"... just blow-jobs, and that's it."

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  Well, see, now I get the
			difference.

	Shot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another
	breathless girl teetering on tall shoes.  She is in the vicinity
	of 16.  Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just
	like the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane.  She is POLEXIA, the
	voluptuous one, from Riverside.

					POLEXIA
				(the usual greeting)
			It's all happening.  It's all happening.

					ESTRELLA
			Polexia!!   Did you tell Sabbath we
			were going to be here?

					POLEXIA
			I talked to Dick with Stillwater, I
			talked with Sabbath.  They're all dying
			to see us.   It's all happening.

					PENNY LANE
			This is our journalist friend.
			Journalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr,
			and Polexia Aphrodisia. And you are --

					WILLIAM
			William.

	Silent beat.  His name lands like a thud.

					POLEXIA
			Here comes Sabbath!

					ESTRELLA
			Ozzy!!!  Tony!!!  It's us!!

	A long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps
	twice.  The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls
	inside.  And then silence again.  The girls do not discuss
	being rebuffed.

					ESTRELLA (cont'd)
			I think I saw Sapphire in there.

					POLEXIA
				(can't hold it in any longer)
			Okay.  I was with Ian Hunter all night
			at Rodney's Last night.  Wanna see his
			spoo?  I saved it in a baggie.

	She opens her purse and shows the girls something inside.
	William edges away.

					ESTRELLA
				(peering into purse)
			I'm really happy he's doing so well.

					PENNY
				(regarding what's in purse)
			Yeah.  I know he's such a talented
			guy.  I mean, look at him.  Who deserves
			it more?

					POLEXIA
				(looking in purse)
			Nobody -- he's so sweet.

					ESTRELLA
				(with compassion)
			Don't you just root for him, you know.
			To go that little distance between
			good and great?

					PENNY
			Wait.  That's not his.  I would know
			his.

	A very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet
	look.  What's in that purse?

	BAM -- THE BACKSTAGE DOOR OPENS

	Out steps SAPPHIRE, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms.  Heavy
	eye-makeup.  Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English.
	In one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne.  In the other,
	a fistful of backstage passes.

					SAPPHIRE
			Does anybody remember laugh-tah?
				(as they turn)
			Come and GET 'EM!

	The girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire.
	Penny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked
	around his.  He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the
	ramp.  Sapphire slaps passes on the girls.  As Scotty (The
	Keeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William
	forward for a pass.

					SCOTTY
			Oh no.  Not this one --

					SAPPHIRE
				(off William)
			Who brought Opie?

	The kid looks over his shoulder.  Who's Opie?

					PENNY
			He's with us.

					SCOTTY
				(hand blocking William)
			He wasn't with you.

					SAPPHIRE
				(to Scotty)
			Are you going to turn this into a
			Thing?

					SCOTTY
			All of you can wait outside!  Top of
			the ramp!

					WILLIAM
			I don't want to cause a Thing.  I'll
			wait.

					PENNY
				(privately, to William)
			I'll go take care of this.

	Sadly, they leave him behind.  The thundering arena sound of
	the collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes'
	"Roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases...
	the glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants
	to be a part of is on the other side of this door.  And then
	it shuts.  He stands alone.

	At the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads.  It reads --
	STILLWATER TOUR 73.  Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening
	band.  This is Stillwater.  Four road-weary band members, and
	their road manager.  Voices booming.

	RUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his
	guitar-case.  It's obvious from moment one.  This is the star
	of the band, the charismatic one.  He's tired.  They're late.
	William recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches.
	The buzzer goes unanswered.  The kid is invisible to him, as
	the others now arrive behind Russell.

	Tour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on
	the steel door.  He has the flaxen-haired look of a former
	hippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest
	silver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes.
	His direction is always - forward.

					DICK
			Let us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on
			the show!!

	William is surrounded by them now.  They stand together under the
	single lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover.  JEFF
	BEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his
	head.  ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging
	limply at his sides.  His is a face made for the background. LARRY
	TURNER the compact bass-player.   Dick now kicks at the door with
	his foot, as William produces a copy of Creem Magazine.

					WILLIAM
				(to Dick)
			Hi, I'm a journalist.  I write for Creem
			Magazine.

	Once again, the magazine hangs there.  He can't give it away.

					JEFF
			The enemy!  A rock writer!

					WILLIAM
				(struggling forward)
			I'd like to interview you or someone
			from the band.

					DICK
				(busy, running behind)
			I'm sorry but could you please fuck
			off?

	William blinks a little, takes it in stride.  Russell sizes
	him up, moving in the background.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  Okay.  I could do that.

					JEFF
			You guys never listened to our records.
			You're all just frustrated musicians.
			Do you know what your magazine SAID
			about us?  What was it - "the singer's
			incessant cater walling distracts From
			an assault with no clear purpose."

					LARRY
				(in background)
			That was Rolling Stone.

					RUSSELL
			Yeah.  Okay.  Fuck off anyway.  We
			play for fans, not critics.

	Stung, William shrugs.  It's been a terrible night, but at
	least thrillingly so.

					WILLIAM
			Russell.  Jeff.  Ed.   Larry.
				(can't help it)
			I really love your band.   I think the
			song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward
			for you guys.  I think you guys
			producing it yourselves, instead of
			Glyn Johns, was the right thing to do.
			And the guitar sound was incendiary.
				(gestures with fist)
			Way to go.

	He turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp.
	Russell looks at the others.  That kind of love is hard to
	give up.

					RUSSELL
				(good humored, yelling)
			Well don't stop there.

					JEFF
			Yeah, come back here!!  Keep going!

	They wave him back, as the backstage door opens again.  The
	kid moves back down the ramp.   They herd him in with them,
	through the door.  Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares
	off.

	Russell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him
	forward.

					SCOTTY
			Not this one.

					RUSSELL
			He's with us.

					SCOTTY
			He's not with you.  He's not with them.
			He's not on the list.  He's not coming
			in.  And this is my arena.  And
			furthermore -

	Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to
	Scotty.

					SCOTTY (cont'd)
			- have a good time tonight.   Welcome
			to San Diego.

	27    INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY -- NIGHT					27

	The band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving
	to keep up.  A young and grizzled red-haired roadie, RED DOG,
	catches them on the way.  The band swarms around him.

					RUSSELL
			Red Dog!

					RED DOG
			We're playing here tomorrow night.

					JEFF
				(aside, to the kid)
			This is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers
			Band's number one roadie.

	Russel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck.

					RUSSELL
			How're the guys?

					RED DOG
			Havin a ball, man.  When we have a
			party, we have an Allman Brothers Band
			party.  Everybody boogies.  Everybody
			gets off.  It's family, man.  We all got
			These now.
				(flashes new mushroom tattoo
			on forearm)
			We'll see you guys in Boston, right?
				(specifically to Russell)
			Dicky and Gregg send you their love.

	Camera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as
	Stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room.

	28    INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT					28

	Dressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply
	listens.  He holds a small microphone.  His stoic look gives away
	little of the full body rush he's experiencing.  As the other
	band members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and
	roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready
	for the show.  To the kid, every word is reckless gem.

					RUSSELL
			... and it's okay, because rock and
			roll is a LIFESTYLE...  and a way of
			thinking and it's not about money and
			"popularity!"

					JEFF
			Some money would be nice.

	Jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into
	his scalp - poor man's mousse.

					RUSSELL
			- but it's a voice that says here I
			am... and FUCK YOU if you can't
			understand me.

	Russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth
	from his guitar case.  The kid notices all these close-up
	details of rock.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			And one of those people is gonna save the
			world and that means that ROCK AND ROLL
			CAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together.

	The kid's eyes dance.  He checks to make sure he's getting the
	recording.  He listens intently.

					JEFF
			And the chicks are great.

					RUSSELL
			But we didn't do it for that!  We are
			here because we needed to fuckin be
			here, not just 'cause we needed to
			away from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE
			DID... but what it all comes down to
			is that thing. The Indefinable Thing,
			when people catch something from your
			music, the thing you put into it.  I'm
			talking about... what am I talking
			about?

					WILLIAM
				(elegantly)
			The buzz?

					RUSSELL
			THE BUZZ!   And the chicks, the
			whatever, is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ.
			And like -- you saying you liked "Fever
			Dog?"   That is the fucking buzz, man.
			All we get are these fucking old-ass
			interviewers who don't understand,
			don't LISTEN, don't appreciate why we
			are here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ.

	William nods, holds his microphone steady.  Russell tunes his
	guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks.
	Jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.

					JEFF
			The next album will be even better.
			More texture.

					RUSSELL
			But... it's not what you put in, is
			it?  It's what you leave out.  Listen
			to... listen to Marvin Gaye...

	Russell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of
	music.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			A song like "What's Going On."  That
			single "woo" at the end of the second
			verse - you know that woo - that single
			"woo."

					WILLIAM
				(proudly)
			I know that, "woo."

					RUSSELL
				(he does it)
			That's what you remember.  The silly
			things, the little things... there's
			only one, and it makes the song.  It's
			what you leave out.  That's rock and
			roll.

	William nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed.
	Activity surrounds him.

					JEFF
				(impressed)
			We used to talk more about this stuff.

					RUSSELL
			Okay.  See, this is maybe the most
			honest we've ever been in an interview
			because you know our music.  You're
			the first press guy we've made friends
			with.  We don't normally talk like
			this to them.  And you're supposed to
			be The Enemy!  What are you - 18?

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			There you go.  Still young enough to
			be honest.

					DICK
				(walkie talkie crackling)
			Ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who
			isn't in the band -- out!

	Russell takes a last swig of beer.  A roadie whisks his guitar
	away.

					DICK (cont'd)
			All this luggage is going to L.A.!

	William is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual,
	past the pile of luggage by the door.  It's a colorful heap of
	suitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a
	number.

	29    INT. BACKSTAGE STEPS -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER			29

	William sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his
	notebook.  Behind him, two steps higher, Penny Lane scoots
	into place.

					PENNY LANE
			I found you a pass.

					WILLIAM
				(amped, distracted)
			Thanks.  I got in with Stillwater.
				(as he writes)
			The guitarist, Russel Hammond, he
			just thoroughly opened up.  He is by
			far the best and most honest interview
			I've ever done.
				(she nods)
			I've only done two, but you know.
			He's number one.

					PENNY LANE
			You're learning.  They're much more
			fun on the way up.

	William nods, still scribbling.  She eases down into place on
	the step next to him.  Her proximity cause him to look at
	her, his eyebrows rising.  She smooths them down with two single
	fingers.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			How old are you?

					WILLIAM
			Eighteen.

					PENNY LANE
			Me too.
				(beat)
			How old are we really?

					WILLIAM
			Seventeen.

					PENNY LANE
			Me too.

					WILLIAM
			Actually I'm 16.

					PENNY LANE
			Me too.  Isn't it funny?  The truth
			just sounds Different.

					WILLIAM
				(confesses)
			I'm 15.

					PENNY LANE
			You want to know how old I really am?

					WILLIAM
				(immediately)
			No.

	She looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning
	up.  Music is her religion.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			How did you get started in all this?

					PENNY LANE
			It's a long story.

					WILLIAM
				(quick study)
			Right.  Right.

					PENNY LANE
			We live in the same city.  We should
			be friends.

	She takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his
	thigh - the cooler location.  Nearby, the dressing room door
	opens, and the Stillwater exits.   Excitement level rises as
	they mass in the hallway with instruments.  We hear the amped
	voice of Russell growing nearer.

					RUSSELL
			The Enemy!

	He approaches, as William stands.  Penny watches, hanging out
	of Russell's eyesight.

	Standing in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to
	introduce his new friends.

					WILLIAM
			Russell, this is Penny Lane.

					PENNY LANE
				(stepping into view)
			Pleasure.

					RUSSELL
			Penny Lane?  Like the song, right?

					PENNY LANE
			Have we met?

	THEY SHAKE

	And do not let go, for too long.  There is history in their
	shake.  Their eyes tell all.  Shot takes us to William, who
	puts two and two together.  It isn't hard.  They clearly know
	each other. Well.

					WILLIAM
			Well, I guess you've... you've met.

					DICK
			Penny Lane!  God's gift to rock and
			roll!!  You're back!
				(privately)
			Marc Bolan.  Please.

	Other band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time,
	waiting in the hallway... and now singing the Beatles song
	"Penny Lane."

					RUSSELL
			Come on, let's go.
				(noting kid's shyness)
			Both of you.

	30    INT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT						30

	House lights go down.  Cheers rise.  Dick's flashlight dances
	on the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the
	dark to the stage steps.

					RUSSELL
			- get in the huddle.

	Russell pulls William into the band's huddle.

	SHOT LOOKING UP AT THEM

	Their band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's
	shoulders in a circle.  They sing a dew lines of the classic
	"Train Kept A-Rollin'" (or "Go See Cal" from the Cal Worthington
	ad) They all touch feet, and then break, heading for the stage.
	Russell directs Penny to his side of the stage.  The kid follows.
	Plugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord --
	thwack.  He steps on effects pedal.  Applause.  (Adlib onstage
	private patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff
	no audience ever hears)  Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to
	address the crowd from the darkened stage.  It is his favorite
	moment of the evening, the highlight of his job.

					DICK
			From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome --
				(importantly)
			Stillwater.

	Light hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening
	song, "If You Say Nothing."  Audience response is strong.
	Shot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most
	undeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty
	seconds.

	Jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some
	vocal pyrotechnics.  Russell looks over to Penny and William,
	at stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an
	elegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he
	belongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first
	guitar lead of the night.  The kid looks over to see Penny
	watching Russell.

	31    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT -- LATER					31

	Cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks.  Stillwater heads
	for their bus.  Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr,
	like a sailor leaving port.   Russell lingers behind, saying
	goodbye to William, loading his own equipment.  Black Sabbath
	passes with entourage, heading to the stage.

					RUSSELL
				(privately)
			So.  You want to come up to L.A., we'll
			be at the "Riot House" all week.

					WILLIAM
			"The Riot House?"

					RUSSELL
			The Continental Hyatt House!  It's on
			Sunset Strip.

					WILLIAM
				(attempting cool)
			Right.  Right.

	All the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the
	backstage crowd of hangers-on.  Looking perhaps for Penny Lane.

					DICK
			Let's blow this burg!

					RUSSELL
				(exiting)
			Well tell your friend Miss Penny Lane
			to Call Me.  Tell her "It ain't
			California without her.  We want her
			around like last summer."   Say it
			like that.

					WILLIAM
			Got it.

					RUSSELL
				(returns, whispers)
			Oh, I'm under the name - Harry Houdini.

					JEFF
				(exiting, to William)
			The Enemy!!  Yeah!!    Come to L.A.,
			we'll take some more.

	Russell joins Jeff, exiting and laughing.  A good show is still
	in the air.

					WILLIAM
			Later Jeff!  See you, Dick.  Larry.
			Ed.
				(and now the roadies)
			Mick, Gregg, Red Dog, Scully, Frosty,
			Estrella, The Wheel!

			ROADIES			   DICK
	  Laterrrr!			 We'll see you down the
						line.

	William is deliriously happy, hands upraised.  He turns to see
	Penny.

					WILLIAM
			PENNY!

					PENNY
				(calming him)
			Hey.  Hey.  Be cool.

					WILLIAM
			You just missed Russell!  He says he's
			at the "Riot House" all week and to call
			him.  He's under the name Harry Houdini.
			Do you know about the "Riot House?"

					PENNY LANE
			I think I've heard of it.

					WILLIAM
			He had a message for you!  He said,
			"It's not California without you.  We
			want you around like last summer."
				(consults notebook)
			Actually he said "ain't."  "It ain't
			California - "

					PENNY LANE
			I get the gist.

					WILLIAM
			How well do you guys know each other?

	She smiles privately.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			I got it.  No problem.  Long story.
			Alright!  I gotta go.

	Elsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing "Sweet
	Leaf."  The kid could care less.  He has bonded with Stillwater.
	He heads for the door.  Penny walks with him.  He's loving it.
	They pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they
	exit out into the ramp area.

	32    EXT. SPORTS ARENA -- NIGHT					32

	Penny takes out an eyeliner pencil, writes her number on the
	back of his green notebook.

					PENNY LANE
			Call me if you need a rescue.  We live
			in the same city.

					WILLIAM
			I think I live in a different world.

	They stand in the night air.  The parking lot is largely silent
	now, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath.  In
	the distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle.

					PENNY
			Speaking of the world.  I've made a
			decision.
				(a very serious secret)
			I'm going to live in Morocco for one
			year. I need a new crowd.

	He nods.  He is a rapt audience for this flashy girl.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			Do you want to come?

					WILLIAM
			Yes.

	In the distance, we hear the family whistle growing louder.

					PENNY
			It's a plan.  You've got to call me.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.

					PENNY
			It's all happening.

					WILLIAM
			It's all happening.

	He nods cooly.  He waits until she turns, and the sprints
	through the parking lot, to the distant family whistle.

								 FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	33    ON TAPE RECORDER							33

	William's fingers work the clunky keys, pressing rewind.  We
	hear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview,
	full of overlapping and barely discernible voices.
	Meticulously, he untangles the voices, especially Russell's,
	as he transcribes.

	INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

	The work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona
	Galaxis.  There is a knock at the window, and William scoots
	back in his chair to see a familiar face.  It is Darryl, his
	sister's old boyfriend.  William opens the window.

					WILLIAM
			Hey Darryl.

					DARRYL
			Hey.

	Darryl climbs in the window, looks around the room that was
	once the site of his previous glory.

					DARRYL (cont'd)
			So she's a stewardess now.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.  She and Mom are still sorta...
			I'd say "not speaking," but I don't
			know if they ever did.

					DARRYL
			Your sister.  A stewardess.
				(nods to himself)
			The things your sister and I did inside
			these four walls...

					WILLIAM
			That's okay.  I don't want to know.
			It's my room now.

					DARRYL
			We flew the friendly skies -

					WILLIAM
			Okay -

					DARRYL
			I don't want to put you in the middle
			of anything.  We don't have to talk
			about it.

					WILLIAM
			No.

					DARRYL
			You seem cooler.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.  I'm thinking about going to
			Morocco.

					DARRYL
			Lemme know if you need a little help
			with your Mom.

					WILLIAM
			A little might not be enough.

					DARRYL
			She still freaks me out.

					WILLIAM
				(nods, an old issue)
			Yeah -

					DARRYL
			She's famous.

					WILLIAM
			Listen -

					DARRYL
			Go ahead and do what you were doing.
			I just wanna hang in here for a moment.

					WILLIAM
			Cool.  Alright.

	William nods and continues his work, self-consciously, as Darryl
	sits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room.  A long
	moment passes.  Darryl pats his thighs, and rises.

					DARRYL
			Okay, man.

					WILLIAM
			Okay, man.

	34    INT. LIVING ROOM -- EVENING					34

	William slips on corduroy jacket, over a tie-dyed shirt.  Well,
	it's definitely a look.  Mom appears more nervous than her
	son.

					ELAINE
			I worry about the drunk drivers.

					WILLIAM
			Mom.  I'm 15.
				(beat, vague panic)
			Right?

					ELAINE
			Yes, you're 15. "And here's that money
			I owed you."

	She reaches in a small box near the door, gives him twenty
	bucks.  It's their routine.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Your dad's favorite joke.  I don't do
			it as well.

					WILLIAM
			I thought it was pretty good.

					ELAINE
			Keep the small bills on the outside.
			And call me if anyone gets drunk.

					WILLIAM
			I will call you if anyone
			anywhere gets drunk.

					ELAINE
			Good.

					WILLIAM
				(anticipating her, like a
			parent)
			And don't take drugs.

					ELAINE
				(stoic)
			Ha ha.  Very funny.  See -- sense of
			humor.  Have fun at the dance.  I'm
			glad you're making friends.

	They move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind
	her she's not going.  He opens the door.  She's a wreck, and
	she knows it.

					WILLIAM
			Mom?

					ELAINE
			Yeah -

					WILLIAM
				(loving but firm, as if to
			a dog.)
			Stay.

					ELAINE
			Oh... okay.

					WILLIAM
			I-love-you-bye.

	He opens the door.  Neil Young.  "Sugar Mountain."  Watching
	him leave is always a killer.  She's not getting any better at
	it either.  She folds her arms tightly across her chest.

	35    EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT					35

	Penny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different
	more elegant look.  She cups her hands and yells up to him.
	He hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost
	falling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin.

	36    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- LATER NIGHT				36

	Miss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset
	Boulevard.  She sings along to the obscure words of Led
	Zeppelin's "Dancing Days."  William takes it all in from the
	passenger seat.  Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or
	beer, but albums.  It's a wondrous piece of geography for any
	rock fan.  Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it all in.
	He moves his head outside the window to see fully.  Her
	windshield is cracked along the side.

					PENNY LANE
			The Continental Hyatt House.  Also known
			as The Riot House.
				(does tour guide voice)
			Every band stays here, all the ones
			that matter.  The Who.  Zeppelin.
			Alice.  Bowie.  English bands.  American
			bands.  We all know each other.  Twenty-
			four hour room service.  Like us, they
			were outsiders.  They were so outside,
			they're inside, and insiders never
			even knew it, because they're outsiders
			and they are inside a place outsiders
			will never be.  And why are we even
			talking about it?  If you're really an
			insider, you're never gonna say it.
			You know what I mean?

					WILLIAM
				(beat, working it out)
			Yeah.  Yes.

	She makes a swift turn into a secret parking spot near the
	hotel.

					PENNY
			And we're not gonna hang out with
			Russell.  You can, but not me.

					WILLIAM
			What is it with you and Russell?

	37    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT					37

	Neil Young and Crazy Horse's "Cinnamon Girl" ricochets across
	the Strip.  It's blasting from cars tuned into KMET.  Penny
	now wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat.  She grabs William's
	hand, steadying her hat at the same time.  They dart across
	the busy street.  She stumbles a little on her platforms.  He
	steadies his taller date.  They are a good team as they pass
	one of several humming tour busses parked out front.

	38    INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY -- NIGHT					38

	Penny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her
	arm.  The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive
	than most clubs.  It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying
	Halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling
	Rockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and
	taller-platforms than Penny Lane.  The feeling is communal,
	illicit, intoxicating.  The secret community of rock.  Penny
	attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.

					PENNY LANE
			It's all happening.
				(grabbing him like a shield)
			And I'm about to use you as protection.

					ROADIE # 1
			Penny Lane!!

					PENNY LANE
				(aside)
			These guys are with Alice Cooper.  I'm
			going to pretend I don't know them.

					ENGLISH ROADIE # 2
			Penny!!  Does Alice know you're here?

					PENNY LANE
			I'm just showing my very dear, very
			wonderful friend around.  He's a very
			important writer - he knows Lester
			Bangs.
				(English accent)
			I'm responsible for his moral conduct
			while he's abroad.

					ROADIE # 3
				(arriving, mock drama)
			Penny Lane!!   God's gift to rock and
			roll!!

					PENNY LANE
			I'm retired.
				(uses English accent)
			And don't argue with me!

					ROADIE # 3
			Again?

					PENNY LANE
				(moving, English accent)
			Have we met?

	Effortlessly touching an arm here and there, charming all -
	she had four men suddenly circling her.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			I've made a decision.  I'm going to go
			traveling in India.  Then I'm going to
			learn how to play the violin.  Then
			I'm going to go to college for one
			year.

	William looks at her, perplexed and a little hurt.  What about
	Morocco?

					ROADIE # 2
				(exiting, not buying it)
			There's nothing they could teach you
			in college, darling.
				(whispers)
			Call Alice.  He's under the name Bob
			Hope.

					ROADIE # 1
			I heard you were with Russell from
			Stillwater.

					PENNY
			Please.  I throw the little ones back.

	Lusty laughs circle William.  Overlapping this dialogue is the
	appearance of our friend Polexia.

					POLEXIA
				(in tears, in pieces,
			emotional)
			Ian Hunter is a fucking asshole!

					WILLIAM
			Polexia!

					POLEXIA
			Opie!!!

	She hugs him like a long-lost friend, knocking the air out of
	him.  And now overlapping this action, appears Superfan RIC
	NUNEZ, 14.  His eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal
	and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes.  Tonight he
	wears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters.
	It features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: "TO
	BE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL."  A felt-tip pen is still in his
	quivering hand.  Nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says:

					RIC
			It's all happening.   I just saw them
			on the seventh floor!  Mr. Jimmy Page...
			Mr. John Paul Jones...
				(displays squiggle on shirt)
			Mr. Robert Plant signed my shirt in
			the elevator!!  Five minutes ago, he
			touched this pen.  Please don't smear
			it.  And Bonzo's gotta new motorcycle
			in the hotel!

					PENNY
			Ric is a Zeppelin fan.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah, I picked that up.

					PENNY
			He tours with them, but not "with"
			them.

					RIC
			They're on the 12th floor, but there's
			guards there!  So you gotta go to the
			tenth floor and go up the back steps.

					PENNY LANE
			This is my very dear, very close, very
			wonderful friend William Miller, he is
			very close with Lester Bangs.

					RIC
			It's all happening!!  See you in
			Cleveland!

	Ric rushes back to the elevators.

					PENNY LANE
			I'm retired!  Doesn't anybody believe
			me!?

	39    INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY PHONE -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER		39

	Penny nearby as William picks up the house phone.  He shouts
	over the din.

					WILLIAM
			Harry Houdini, please.

	As he waits, he discreetly pockets the matches, hotel pad and
	pencil next to the housephone.

	40    INT. HALLWAY/RUSSELL'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT			40

	William, Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway,
	looking for the room.  William looks in the passing open doors,
	each one a different window into another world.

					PENNY LANE
			Okay.  Time to put on the lampshade.

	Up ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open.
	Inside, a band party in full swing.  A clunky early-model boom
	box segues from James Brown's "Make It Funky" to Led Zeppelin's
	"Gallows Pole."   Russell Hammond is the center of this party,
	jabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar.  Much singing
	echoes all around.  It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all
	members of the band are present.  Penny Lane takes a breath
	and enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite
	directions.  She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with
	proper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			"Ladies and Gentlemen.  Please
			extinguish all smoking materials and
			notice that the captain has turned on
			The No Smoking sign.  Your seat and
			tray tables should be locked in their
			full and upright positions."

					RUSSELL/OTHERS
			PENNY!!  PENNY LANE!!

	She is instantly and overwhelmingly, the life of this party.
	Russell joins William.

					RUSSELL
				(impressed to see him)
			Alright.

					WILLIAM
				(happy to be there)
			Alright.

	Russell places a beer in William's hands, and exits.

					PENNY LANE
				(continuing)
			"In the unlikely event of a water
			landing, the seat below you will serve
			as a -"
				(give up)
			Oh, the hell with it.

	They all applaud her, laughing.  William watches her with
	wonder, as she turns his way and winks.  Jeff approaches the
	alluring Polexia, and goes to get her a beer.  Meanwhile,
	Polexia sidles up to William.  She sees him watching Penny at
	the other side of the room.

					POLEXIA
				(privately)
			Act One, in which she pretends she
			doesn't care about him.

	POV shot travels to Russell, strumming the guitar that is always
	a part of his body.  Russell is watching Penny Lane
	surreptitiously.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Act Two, in which he pretends he doesn't
			care... and goes right for her.

	Russell moves towards Penny.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Act Three, in which it all plays out
			the way she planned it.  She'll eat
			him alive.

					WILLIAM
				(worried)
			We've got to stop them.

					POLEXIA
			Stop them?  You were her excuse for
			coming here.

	ON PENNY

					PENNY
			I need ice!

	Penny disappears out the door, across the hallway.  Russell
	follows a moment later.  The kid's eyebrows rise.  Polexia
	regards the kid with affection, adjusting his collar and peeling
	a hair off his jacket.

					POLEXIA
			I just worry about people using her.
			You know?  'Cause she brings out the
			good side in everybody else, but what
			do they do for her?  Life kills me.
			Do you have any pot?

					WILLIAM
			Not on me.

					POLEXIA
			Do you smoke?

					WILLIAM
			No.
				(attempting to fit in)
			But I... I grow it.  I grow it.

	Polexia looks at the kid, laughing at his poor job of lying.

					POLEXIA
			You're funny.  You know, if you were
			only taller, English, rich, a guitar-
			player and older...

					WILLIAM
			I'd be someone else.

					POLEXIA
			Yeah.  Good point.

	Jeff appears with her beer, and she whispers in the kid's ear
	before she exits with Jeff Bebe.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Bless me father for I may sin tonight.

	The kid watches, as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of
	Russell's, Eddie Giles' "Losin' Boy."  There is the sound of a
	motorcycle somewhere down the hallway.

	41    INT. ICE ROOM -- NIGHT						41

	The ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise.  Penny
	puts ice in her glass.  Behind her, Russell moves into frame,
	hands delicately riding the sides of her body.  A motorcycle
	roars by, just outside the door, as Penny moves away from
	Russell's exploring hands.

					PENNY
				(with real indignation)
			How does it end?

					RUSSELL
			What?

					PENNY
			You know - the story about the girl
			who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex
			wife -- the one we don't talk about --
			and gets a hundred... okay, five letters
			from him, and then doesn't even leave
			a pass in San Diego.  Wake up!  I'm
			retired and I never believed you anyway.
			You're too talented and too good-looking
			to be trusted and everybody knows it.

					RUSSELL
				(smiling, loves it)
			You're retired like Frank Sinatra is
			retired.

	She makes a scoffing noise.  He moves to the ice machine, with
	a glass of his own.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Miss Penny Lane.  Let me tell you what
			rock and Roll will miss the day you
			truly retire.

	He tosses cubes in his glass, one by one.  After the first cube:

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			The way you turn a hotel room into a
			home.
				(cube)
			The way you pick up strays wherever
			you go.  Like Pied Piper.
				(cube)
			The way you know the words to every
			song.  Every song.  Especially the bad
			ones.  Mostly the bad ones.
				(cube)
			That green coat in the middle of summer.
				(cube)
			The real name you won't reveal.
				(cube)
			And.  I'd keep going, but my glass if
			full.

					PENNY
				(quietly)
			Damn.

	He kisses her powerfully, hands at his sides.  She fights to
	keep her hands off him.  Bonham's motorcycle rips by, just
	outside the door.

					RUSSELL
			Come to Arizona.

					PENNY
			Never.

					RUSSELL
			We leave Thursday morning.  9 AM.  And
			pack light this time.  Jesus.

	They kiss.  The motorcycle speeds by again, just outside.

	42    INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT						42

	The hallways are crowded, as William looks at the closed door
	of the ice room.  He leans against the wall, alone now.  Trying
	to look like he belongs.  Behind him, most of the band has
	disappeared into other rooms, leaving only hangers-on in their
	places.

	43    INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY				43

	Music.  We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor.
	These are the San Francisco-based main offices of Rolling Stone
	Magazine.  We have arrived for the waning days that this
	magazine could still be called, with a straight-face, an
	"underground" publication.  Their mounting success crowds the
	edges of every frame.  Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz
	portraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon, Jagger, Rod Stewart,
	James Taylor.

	We find editor BEN FONG-TORRES, 29,  in his cramped cubicle.
	Sitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff
	writer, DAVID FELTON, 32, who smokes his cigarettes with a long
	holder.  Felton reads one of William's articles, chuckling.

					BEN FONG-TORRES
			William Miller?

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY

	William is on the phone in his own small room.

					WILLIAM
			This is he.

					BEN
			Crazy.  William, this is Ben Fong-
			Torres.  I'm the music editor at Rolling
			Stone Magazine.  We've got a copy of
			your stories from the San Diego Door.
			This is the same William Miller?

	William instantly, nervously alters his voice to sound older.

					WILLIAM
			Yes it is.

					BEN
				(rifling through tearsheets)
			Voice of God, howling dogs, the spirit
			of rock And roll... this is good solid
			stuff.

					WILLIAM
				(immediately, suddenly
			deeper)
			Thanks... thanks.

					BEN
			You should be writing for us.  Any
			ideas?

					WILLIAM
				(voice now to deep)
			How about Stillwater?

					BEN
			Crazy.  New album... their third...
			starting to do something.

	Ben shuffles through papers, looking for a tour itinerary on
	his promotional-material laden-desk, automatically plotting
	the piece aloud.

					BEN (cont'd)
				(pleasant, terse)
			Stillwater.  Hard-working band makes
			good.  Get 'em to respond to the critics
			who dismissed the first two albums as
			workmanlike. Guitarist is the clear star
			of the band.  Crazy.  Let's do three-
			thousand words.  You'll catch up to them
			on the road.  We'll set up billing --
			don't let the band pay for anything.

					WILLIAM
				(affecting casualness)
			Sounds good.

					BEN
			We can only pay -- lemme see, three-
			thousand words -- seven hundred dollars.

	The kid's eyes widen.

					BEN (cont'd)
			Alright, a grand.   What's your
			background?  You a journalism major?

					WILLIAM
				(deeply)
			Yes.

					BEN
			What college --

	INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

	Elaine now gets on the extension.

					ELAINE
			Honey, I need you to do that thing
			that fixes the garbage disposal --

	She hangs up.

	INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

	The kid is paralyzed.

					BEN
			Well, I know how my lady gets when I
			don't Snap to it -

					WILLIAM
			Crazy.

					BEN
			Crazy!  I'll let you go.  Call me at
			the San Francisco office tomorrow.

	44    INT. LESTER BANGS HOME -- LATE NIGHT				44

	The great Lester Bangs stands in the promotional album-clogged
	bedroom of his Birmingham, Michigan, home/office at Creem
	Magazine.  There is nothing in frame that does not deal with
	music.  In the background, a scratchy and chaotic Coltrane
	record.

					LESTER BANGS
			Beware Rolling Stone Magazine.  They
			will change your story, they'll re-
			write it and turn it into swill.
			Beware!!

					WILLIAM
			But besides that, what would be wrong
			with it?

					LESTER BANGS
				(laughs, entertained)
			You have starry eyes, my friend.
				(beat)
			Look.  Do the story.  It's a good break
			for ya.  But remember this --

	The kid listens intently, and makes notes.

					LESTER BANGS (cont'd)
			... don't do it to make friends with
			people who are trying to use you to
			further the big business desire to
			glorify worthless rock stars like
			Stillwater.  And don't let those swill
			merchants re-write you.

					WILLIAM
				(still copying)
			... swill merchants...

					LESTER BANGS
			Now.  What are you listening to?

	45    EXT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE -- DAY					45

	William knocks on the teacher's lounge door.  A Teacher answers,
	protective of their sanctuary.

					WILLIAM
				(urgently)
			I need to talk to Mrs. Deegan, from
			Journalism.

	Mrs. Deegan appears in the doorway.

	46    EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- LATE AFTERNOON				46

	The sun is still shining.  It's late afternoon, as Elaine Miller
	exits her car and arrives home.  She sees a few extra cars in
	the driveway, is immediately suspicious.

	47    INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON				47

	Elaine arrives to find William, Mrs. Deegan and Darryl awaiting
	her in the living room.  It's a 1973-style intervention.  They
	wear sunny, compassionate smiles.

					ELAINE
			Whatever it is, the answer is no.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Elaine, we need to talk to you.
			Nothing is wrong.  I am a teacher.
			You're a teacher.  We speak the same
			language.

	Mom sits down.  She is fully engaged and worried, her natural
	state.

					MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
			Now I'm not a jump-up-and-down person,
			but something wondrous has happened to
			William.  And you have every reason to
			be happy...
				(knows her)
			... and calm.

	Carefully gauging Elaine's face, the teacher continues.

					MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
			William has been gifted with a shining
			opportunity in the world of journalism.
			Through a love of music, and at an
			oddly-young age, he has received a major
			assignment from a national publication
			called Rolling Stone Magazine.

	Mrs. Deegan produces a copy, and places it on Elaine's lap.
	It sits there like the plague.

					MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
			Now you are rather famously not a fan
			of rock music, but such are the ironies
			of life, that happens to be the very
			topic of William's assignment -
				(cheerfully)
			- rock music.  A band.

					ELAINE
				(warily, to Darryl)
			Honey, what are you doing here?

					DARRYL
			Moral support.

	Mom looks evenly at her son, seated opposite her in this small
	living room.

					ELAINE
			What's involved?

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Well.  It's a great opportunity.  He'll
			be well-paid, and published nationally --
				(quickly)
			-- and he'll go on tour with a rock
			band for four days.  No small planes...
			he travels on a bus.

					ELAINE
			Is it time for me to say something?

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Sure.

					ELAINE
			No.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			And in anticipation of that response -

					ELAINE
			No.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			-- William has prepared --

					ELAINE
				(rueful)
			"Lo, that which I have feared has come
			upon me."

					WILLIAM
				(lightening fast)
			"He who jealously guards his fears,
			quietly yearns to bring them about!"

	Mrs. Deegan admires their high-strung intellectual parrying,
	makes an impressed noise.

					ELAINE
				(with compassion)
			No.  I have raised him to be an honor
			student, which he is.  We have agreed
			on all our goals.  We raised him to be
			a lawyer, we moved here to be near the
			finest law school in the West.  Plus,
			he has finals coming up, and in one
			week he graduates with all his friends
			-

					DARRYL
			He's got no friends!!

					WILLIAM
			Darryl.  Please.

	Nearby, having anticipated all of the above, William nods to
	Mrs. Deegan, and stands.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Elaine, may I present to you... your
			own son.

	William takes a lawyerly stroll, turns to face his mom.

					WILLIAM
			Lady of the Jury.
				(beat)
			I wish to disprove the prevailing false
			belief that rock music is based on drugs
			and sex.  True, perhaps at one time...
			but rock music is different now.  It is
			now performed by hard-working
			intellectuals, with... with blazing
			intellectual pursuits, and I am going to
			play for you a piece of music designed
			to show you that my thesis is correct.

					ELAINE
			This is going to be hell.

	Across the room, Darryl takes his position near the stereo.

					WILLIAM
			The song is based on the literature of
			Tolkien...  and it's mystical attempt
			to elevate humanity has been successful
			throughout the world...  this song
			will change your life.

	Mom stifles a cough.  William nods to Darryl, who reverentially
	drops the needle with a thud.  Mom is trapped, as we listen to
	silent static... and then... the opening notes of Led Zeppelin's
	"Stairway to Heaven."  William gives his Mother the album
	cover's inner-sleeve with lyrics.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			We ask you only to listen.

	Camera passes across their serious and expectant faces.  The
	intro in not short.  We listen, just watching their faces, as
	Elaine becomes increasingly impatient.

			ELAINE				WILLIAM
	  When is it going to start -   Soon.

	Immediately, overlapping, the vocal begins.  ("There's a lady
	who's sure all that glitters is gold.")

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	48    SUN MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY					48

	Sprinklers click across the lawns.  ("... and it makes me
	wonder... ")

	49    INT. LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON					49

	Mom adjust herself in the chair, listens politely, checks her
	watch.  She looks at William.

	50    EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON						50

	Sprinklers continue.  ("If there's a bustle in your hedgerow...
	")

	51    INT. LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON					51

	Mom listens fitfully.  The song continues.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	52    EXT. HOUSE -- STILL LATER AFTERNOON				52

	Sprinklers shut off.  Music is now blasting.  ("To be a rock,
	and not to roll... ")

	53    INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON				53

	Mom's face remains stoic to the bitter end.  ("... and she's
	buying the Stairway to Heaven.")  The song ends.  Silence.
	All look to Elaine.  They wait on her response.  We hear the
	turntable arm return to its cradle.

					ELAINE
			What am I supposed to say?   You say
			it's Tolkien, fine.  They sound like
			nice kids.  Is it meant to elevate
			humanity?  "Sure, let's elevate
			humanity.  After we sell you drugs and
			sex."  All I have is my honesty.  That's
			what I believe, and that's what I know.
				(flipping through magazine)
			Oh.  Here's a nice ad.

	She holds up the magazine.  And ad reads, in large bold type:
	BUY THIS FUCKING ALBUM.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			You've clearly ganged up on me, and I
			still say no.  No no no no no no no.

	She shuts her eyes, and blurts out something against her better
	judgement.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			NO MORE THAN FOUR DAYS AND I WANT A
 PHONE NUMBER FOR WHERE YOU ARE EVERY MINUTE AND I WANT YOU TO CALL ME TWICE A DAY AND YOU'D BETTER NOT MISS ONE 			TEST - AND NO DRUGS.

	William nods gratefully, and exits frame.  Hold on the empty
	chair, as drums herald the beginning of the Allman Brothers
	Band's "Trouble No More" from Live at Fillmore East.

	SHOT MOVES IN ON ELAINE

	who feels a very particular kind of loneliness.  It's the
	loneliness she got married, and then raised a family, to escape.

	54    INT. STILLWATER TOUR BUS -- DAY					54

	An empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle,
	taking us to William.  William picks up the bottle and places
	it in the seat back pocket in front of him.  He has joined the
	circus, and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and
	forbidding than he expected.  The bus struggles to make it up
	the hill, back rows shuddering loudly, as music continues.

					DICK
			C'mon, Doris!  Darling Bus.  You can
			make it!

	55    EXT. NEVADA DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY					55

	The Stillwater Tour Bus rumbles down the desert highway.  The
	destination banner reads - ALMOST FAMOUS -- TOUR 73.  Music
	continues.

	56    INT. BUS - DAY							 56

	William strains for a look at Russell five rows up.  He plays
	slide guitar, working out a part.   Next to Russell is Penny
	Lane.  Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash
	- takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe.

					PENNY
			Gotcha.

	Jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover.  Penny stuffs the
	shot in her pocket.  William watches, his private heart pounds.
	Polexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness.

					POLEXIA
			Do you have any pot?

					WILLIAM
			No.  I'm a journalist.

					POLEXIA
			Well, go do your job then.  You're on
			the road, man.  It's all happening!  Get
			in there.  Go talk to 'em!

	Challenged, William rises and approaches Russell.  He fixes
	the charismatic guitarist in his sights. Shot takes him down
	the aisle to the jamming star guitarist.  He crouches in the
	aisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody.  His
	mood is in the air.

					WILLIAM
				(very professional)
			Russell.   Do you think we might be
			able to find some time to talk when we
			get to Phoenix?  I want to interview
			everyone separately... and I felt we'd
			start with you and me.

	Nearby, Jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous.

					RUSSELL
			Absolutely.

	Russell turns away.  The kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle,
	babbling on.

					WILLIAM
			Because I've got a thing in a couple
			days.

					RUSSELL
			What.

					WILLIAM
				(self-conscious)
			It's a... thing where... uhm... you go
			there to graduate.  School.

					RUSSELL
				(sharply)
			I never graduated.  And look what
			happened.  You're here interviewing me.

	Good point.  Laughs from everybody listening nearby.  It's a
	good line.  William makes a quick jot in his notebook.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			No no no.  Don't put that in Rolling
			Stone.  My bio says I graduated.  We'll
			come up with something better later.
			Just enjoy the ride.

	Russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away.
	Penny notices William's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while
	grabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry.

					LARRY
			How did you know I was thirsty?

	He didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is.  He nods
	thanks to Penny, the perfect road companion for all.  And then
	Penny gives the other Coke, her Coke, to William.  He accepts
	it too, and starts back to his seat.  He's been blown off, and
	he knows it, but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and
	whispers in his ear:

					PENNY
			I may need to stay in your room tonight.
			Russell's in a bad mood.  He's very
			Bob Dylan in Don't Look Back today.
			He's trying to write.

	William nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his
	seat.  A large joint passes in front of him, across him, to
	Polexia, as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another
	hill.

					POLEXIA
				(inhaling deeply)
			Want some?

					WILLIAM
			No thanks.

	A wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face.  It
	surrounds him like a cloud.   The bus shudders, as Russell
	continues playing slide up ahead.

	57    INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				57

	Elaine sits in her living room, filled with her books.  Large
	Department store photos of her children on the wall.  She feels
	her own loneliness, and his too, as she dials a phone number.

					ELAINE
			Has William Miller arrived yet?  He
			hasn't.  Could you give him a message
			as soon as you see him? -

	58    INT. BUS -- NIGHT							58

	Several hours later on this ride.  Outside, night and desert.
	Inside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness
	of the bus.  The end of the Led Zeppelin classic "Whole Lotta
	Love" plays from the bus stereo, full blast.  Everybody is
	free and anonymous in the dark.  They sing at full-volume.
	William looks out the window in wonder.

					ZEPPELIN/ALL
			"Way down inside... (woman)
			woman...  you need... "

	The ten-ton guitar chord of Jimmy Page.

					ZEPPELIN/ALL (cont'd)
			"Loooooooooooooooooooooooovvve... "

	John Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still
	singing as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix.  William
	watches the living documentary around him.  He writes furiously
	in the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady
	his writing on the bumpy bus.  Behind him, someone is beating
	along to the song on his seat.  He never want to leave this world.

	59    INT. ARIZONA RAMADA INN LOBBY -- NIGHT				59

	All enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack.  The hotel chairs
	are spotted with curious hangers-on, decked out and lounging.
	Dick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk.   The
	sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick.  He
	is forever teaching others their jobs.

					DICK
			Jeff, Tony... Keys... keys... keys...
			room list...
				(re: luggage, to hotel
			bellman)
			If it doesn't have a number on it, it
			ain't ours!

	He gives key and a stack of messages to Russell, and turns to
	William who he makes feel more important.  Penny is nearby with
	her suitcase and tackle box purse.  William watches Russell's
	guitars whisked away - they are luggage-numbered 1, 3, and 4.

					DICK (cont'd)
			The Enemy!  Here you go, here's the key to
			your palatial suite, room list, plus let me
			give you a luggage tag.  You're Number 42.

					CLERK
			Is this Mr. Miller?  You have a message
			from Elaine.

					WILLIAM
			Thanks.

					CLERK
				(confidentially)
			She's a handful.

					WILLIAM
			I know.

	William cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it,
	and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen.
	Jeff exchanges a look with Russell.  Nearby, the walking
	commotion arrives, clacking through the lobby.  It's Sapphire.
	Last night's clothes are now today's.  She holds a travel case,
	and hanger with some odd blouses.

					SAPPHIRE
			Finally, you're here!!  They kicked me
			out of my room!  Fuck Ozzy!

	She hugs Penny Lane.  Estrella appears, happy to have help
	with Sapphire.

	ON RUSSELL

	who approaches William.

					RUSSELL
			Come by in a few minutes.  We'll do
			the interview.

	The kid exits and goes to join Penny, who is still comforting
	Sapphire.  Russell looks through his messages.  The guitar,
	now in a case, never leaves his hand.  Jeff Bebe approaches,
	regarding William standing with Penny and the girls.  Intrigue
	is swirling in the lobby.

					JEFF
			I'm worried, man.

					RUSSELL
			Naw, we can trust him.  He's a fan.

					JEFF
			But it's Rolling Stone.  He looks
			harmless, but he does represent the
			magazine that trashed Eric Clapton,
			broke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin,
			and wrote that lame story about the
			Allman Brothers Band that bummed Duane
			out before he died.  Don't forget the
			Rules.  This little shit is the Enemy.
			He writes what he sees.
				(beat)
			But it would be cool to be on the cover.

					RUSSELL
			Leave it to me.  We'll get a good story.

					JEFF
			Plus our girlfriends read this magazine
			and -
				(looking at Band-aids)
			-- you know.

					RUSSELL
			You made your point.  I'll take to
			him.

	ON WILLIAM BY ELEVATOR

	Penny speaks confidentially to him.  If she is slightly bossy,
	it is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and
	otherwise.

					PENNY
			Can Sapphire stay in your room tonight?
			She had a big fight with Ozzy, and
			Polexia's not working out with Jeff
			Bebe.
				(to Sapphire and Polexia)
			You just have to remember... these
			guys are jealous, insecure, talented,
			egocentric, and manipulative geniuses...
			they're lead-singers.   They can say
			"I love you" to 20,000 people... but
			any fewer is a real problem.
				(girls nod, comforted, she
			continues to the kid)
			Jeff Bebe has so much jealousy over
			Russell that he can't express.  Plus,
			he never slept last night.   You keep
			Sapphire and I'll stay with Russell.

	William covers his disappointment over losing Penny as a
	roommate.  Cooly:

					WILLIAM
			Sure.  I'll take her.

					POLEXIA
			Me too?

					WILLIAM
			Sure.

	Estrella arrives with travel bag, equally homeless, looking
	hopeful.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			If there's room -

	Penny squeezes him.  He feels cool... but the girl he really
	wanted to stay in his room now joins Russell, disappearing
	into the elevator.  He looks down at the message in his hand,
	and opens it.

	It reads: DON'T TAKE DRUGS!  He snaps it closed quickly, before
	anyone can see.

	59A   IN. RUSSELL's ROOM -- NIGHT						59A

	Russell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap.
	Trying to write.  It's coming slowly.  Shot moves off him,
	past a flickering television, onto Penny who silently and
	intently watches Russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird.
	He looks over at her - she turns away quickly.  He goes back
	to work.  Tries to catch her watching him again.  She turns
	away just in time.

	60    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT				60

	Stillwater's "Fever Dog" plays from the t.v. radio.   William
	on the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap.  His hotel
	room.  He watches self-consciously as the girls go about the
	ritual of inhabiting a room on the road.  Sapphire flutters a
	paisley scarf over the room lamp.  Polexia puts a towel along
	the crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too-
	many sticks of incense, and moves to the phone.  Estrella has
	joined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes.
	Instantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this,
	the smallest room in the hotel.   William thumbs through the
	phone book with fascination.

					WILLIAM
			All these people.
				(wondrous, off phone book)
			And they all live in Phoenix.

					POLEXIA
				(on phone)
			Hi Dad!!  I can't talk long!  I'm here in
			Paris.  I'm staying in another Youth Hostel
			with no phone and no address for mail!!

					WILLIAM
			(still wondrous, from phone
			 book)
			Alex.  Lowbatz.

					SAPPHIRE
				(emerging from bathroom)
			I was the one who told him what to
			tattoo on his fingers, I was the one
			who made his shirts... I was there
			when his wife left him.

					WILLIAM
			Charles.  C.  Swoop.

					POLEXIA
				(on phone)
			I CAN SEE THE EIFFELL TOWER.  DO YOU
			KNOW THERE ARE 578 STEPS TO THE TOP?

	She's reading from a European tour book.

					WILLIAM
			Paul and Debbie Finger.

					ESTRELLA
				(looking out window)
			Oh my God.  Simon Kirke of Bad Company
			is by the pool.

	The girls mobilize by the window.  William is increasingly
	aware that he is an outsider in his own tiny room.  He tries
	to organize his stuff in the corner.

					POLEXIA
			I GOTTA GO!  I'LL CALL FROM ROME!

					ESTRELLA
			Is anybody here as worried about Penny
			and Russell as I am?

					POLEXIA
				(the perfect daughter)
			AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MAGGIE!!
			I LOVE YOU!!

	She winks at William, who looks away.

					SAPPHIRE
				(to Polexia and William)
			Ooo, watch out - whoever you look at
			when you say that - that's who you
			really mean.

	Polexia hands up and throws a pillow at Sapphire,  the kid
	watches these girls like a tennis match.

	60A   IN. PENNY AND RUSSELL'S ROOM - SAME TIME				60A

	Russell puts down his guitar.

					RUSSELL
			You know.  We should talk about what
			we don't talk about.

					PENNY
			We don't have to.

					RUSSELL
			No, I - I went to Catholic school.  I
			believe in guilt and... you know, if
			there's any to be had, I pretty much
			want to roll around in it.

					PENNY
			I don't believe in attachments.  No
			boundaries.  Just the music.

					RUSSELL
			I'm just saying, it's okay to talk
			about it.

	Penny stands and turns.  She speaks the word.

					PENNY
			Leslie.

	Russell nods.  The name is out in the open.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.

					RUSSELL
				(somehow satisfied)
			Alright - now we're talking.

	But she continues, saying the name in a multitude of different
	ways, in different accents, and with different degrees of
	indifference and passion and lust and play-acting and mock-
	drama.

	PUSH IN ON HIS FACE

	As he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning.
	Is she mocking him?   In love with him?  Taunting him?  Seducing
	him?

					PENNY
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Lesssssslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			LESlie.  Leslie...

	She continues saying it until it no longer has meaning.  And
	finally she sits next to him.

					PENNY (cont'd)
				(beat)
			Now.  Have I helped you get that off
			your chest?

	They kiss.

	60B   INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME				60B

	The girls continue their settling-in process.

					SAPPHIRE
			Opie, can I order room service?

	The nickname "Opie" re-opens a nagging wound.  Polexia hangs
	up, and begins to dial again.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  You guys.  Wait.   Put down the
			phone, Polexia.
				(she does, sadly)
			First, this is my room...

					SAPPHIRE
			Come on, you're a fan like us.  You're
			on our side of the line.

					WILLIAM
			Second.  I'm not Opie.  Alright?  Opie
			is a little boy.  I'm here to do a
			job.  I am a professional.

					ESTRELLA
				(flipping luggage tag)
			Ooooooo, sorry, Mr. 42.

					WILLIAM
			Third!
				(has their attention now)
			... this phone is a big, big deal.  In
			a minute, I have to go interview
			Russell.  Do not answer this phone if it
			rings.  I have family members with
			severe anxiety Problems.  She will not
			understand.

					POLEXIA
				(wounded)
			But what if Ozzy calls Sapphire?   And
			I gave Jimmy Page this number.

					ESTRELLA
			Or a guy who looked like Jimmy Page.

	William looks at their troubled faces, full of too much-longing
	and too much make-up.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.   I have a solution.  Answer the
			phone.  But if anyone without an English
			accent is on the phone...
				(winging it)
			Just hang up.  Or say it's the wrong
			room.

	They nod.  It's a good plan.

	61    EXT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT						 61

	The hanging sign on the door reads: DO NOT DISTURB. William
	knocks on Russell's door. A maid pushes up against him with
	her cart, which now blocks the hallway.

					WILLIAM
			SHOULD I COME BY LATER?

	A group of golf conventioneers are now trapped behind the maid
	cart.  They ease past William as he negotiates with Russell
	through the door.

					RUSSELL (O.S.)
			 YES, I'M IN TOO TRUTHFUL A MOOD!

					WILLIAM
			MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING!!

					RUSSELL (O.S.)
			I'LL SEE YOU AT THE RADIO INTERVIEW
			LATER!!  TEN-THIRTY IN THE LOBBY.

					WILLIAM
			OKAY!

					RUSSELL
			GO AWAY!

					WILLIAM
			OKAY!

	We hear Penny's giggle.  Then the door opens, and it's Penny
	looking ravishing.  In the background, Russell sits shirtless
	at the table.  He playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up
	wads of hotel stationery.

					PENNY
			Don't worry.  Some to the radio
			interview.

					WILLIAM
			No, I'm fine.  I'll just interview
			Jeff Bebe some more.

					RUSSELL
				(as in "you're on of us")
			GO AWAY!

	She shuts the door quickly.  It hurts a little.  He picks up
	the wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket.  He
	leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and
	matches from the nearby maid's cart.  Then he returns to
	Russell's door.  He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds
	of laughter, just for a moment, escalating.  He flips the sign
	over: HOUSEKEEPING PLEASE ENTER - CLEAN ROOM.

	62    INT. OUTER RADIO STATION - NIGHT					62

	Humble Pie.  "Thirty Days in the Hole."  Russell and band enter
	the radio station, passing through the now-empty front office.
	As always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good.
	Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles,
	as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold
	records  and head down the small hallway to the control room
	interview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her
	green coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a
	little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will
	have none of it.  She privately shares every great passing
	moment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms.
	It's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own "Fever Dog."

	63    INT. RADIO CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT					63

	Stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone
	in this room.  Russell takes a seat near the open mike.  Jeff
	Bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be
	just as close to the microphone as Russell.  William watches
	all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth.
	Stillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE
	ALLEN, 25.

	Quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it.
	The entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and
	ready for the interview.   William can't avoid looking at Penny
	Lane, who looks great tonight.  She catches him, and he barely
	looks away in time.  Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff,
	notices.  The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the
	microphone, as the finale of "Fever Dog" is just ending.

					QUINCE ALLEN
			The guitar of Russell Hammond.   "Fever
			Dog"...  The band is Stillwater.
				(beat)
			Watch with your mind as they
			materialize.

	Band members gets closer to the microphone, preparing to speak.
	Quince lowers his head, shutting his eyes and getting into the
	music as the song plays out.

	64    INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						64

	The phone rings.  Estrella answers.

					ESTRELLA
			William's room.

	INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICE -- NIGHT

	Ben Fong-Torres is calling from Rolling Stone.

					BEN
			Can I please speak to him?  This is
			Ben Fong-Torres at Rolling Stone.

	Estrella panics,  hangs up quickly, as if the phone has just
	caught fire.

					ESTRELLA
			I think I just messed up!

	65    INT. RADIO STATION -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME				65

	Quince raises his head and continues on-the-air.  The same
	song is still ending.

					QUINCE
			Look at the dogs, wearing the funny
			hats.  Juggling just for you.  Freaks
			and family...

	Penny shoots William a look.   Do you believe this guy?

					QUINCE (cont'd)
			It's Quince, with Stillwater.  Here.
			Live.  It's the Night Circus.

	The band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk.  Quince
	continues, looking meaningfully at the band.  They are
	waiting... eager for a chance to speak.

					QUINCE (cont'd)
			Every minute a baby is born somewhere..
			Life.  Death.  Hermetically sealed
			bags of human emotion.  Bags of love...
			bags of kindness?
				(suddenly, turns)
			How'd you get together?

	As Jeff eagerly speaks, Quince lowers his head and listens...
	feels... the words of his guests.

					JEFF
			Well... not to get into a "me" thing...
			this is Jeff talking... but I did start
			the band, some time, actually, ago.
			This is back when we were the Jeff
			Bebe band, and I placed an ad in a
			magazine called Peaches looking for a
			guitarist and Russell Hammond answered.

	Quince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly.

					QUINCE
				(with deep understanding)
			Peaches.

	Jeff watches Quince's head lower.  It's hard to know when to
	talk with Quince.  The depth of his mellowness is tough to get
	in rhythm with.

					JEFF
			I think he was a gift from God,
			actually.  Nobody plays like Russell
			Hammond.

					RUSSELL
				(sorta moved)
			Well, shit.  Thank you.

	He instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Ooops.  Better hit the delay button.

	All eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to
	some inner beat.  He says nothing.  The band looks at each
	other.  We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be
	asleep.  Long silence.  William shares an amazed look with
	Penny.  Quince is definitely asleep.  Russell leans forward
	and continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Okay - we're talking now, right?  Why
			the fuck do you wait until and interview
			in Arizona to say something nice about
			me.  Why don't you say it to my fucking
			face sometime?  Because I tell you
			every time I think you nailed something.

					JEFF
			Everybody pays you compliments.  It's
			not my fucking job to kiss your fucking
			ass all the time.

					RUSSELL
			Well then who's fucking job is it?
			Because my ass is dying for a kiss.
			And I know yours is too.

					DICK
			It's my fucking job.  You're all
			geniuses.  And let me just add this
			thought - smegma.

	Penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to William.
	He offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room.
	William shares a look.  Quince is still deeply asleep, as the
	usually quiet tony leans forward to speak.

					TONY
			Feces.

	He cracks himself up, silently.  Quince snaps awake, fully in-
	stride.

					QUINCE
			The dong is called "Love Thing." Your
			mind is Starting to take effect.
			They're all here to see you swallow
			fire.  You scream soundlessly...  on the
			Night Circus.  It's Quince, with
			Stillwater.

	"Love Thing" takes over, as Quince swivels in the chair.

					QUINCE (cont'd)
			I thought that went well.

	66    INT. RENTAL CAR -- NIGHT						 66

	Adrenalized laughter.  The whole band is crammed into a medium-
	sized rental car.  Penny half on William's lap, half on
	Russell's.

					RUSSELL
				(to William)
			See, this is what nobody writes about!
			The in-between times!   This!  Us!
			Right now!!

	67    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM						67

	The phone is ringing.  Estrella emerges from the bathroom with
	no make-up and a t-shirt.  She picks up the phone.  Across the
	room, Sapphire signs for room service.  Now she is far too
	made-up.  The t.v. radio plays Free's "Fire and Water" in the
	b.g.

					ESTRELLA
				(suspiciously)
			Hello?

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

	It's Mom on the phone.

					ELAINE
				(measured, very proper)
			May I speak with William please?

					ESTRELLA
				(cheerfully)
			He's not here.  I think he's in the
			bar with the Band.  They just got back
			from the radio station.  Is this Maryann
			with the pot?

	Silence.

					ESTRELLA (cont'd)
			Hello?

					ELAINE
			No this isn't Maryann with the pot.
			This is Elaine... his Mother.

	Estrella physically recoils.

					ESTRELLA
				(cringing)
			I thought you were English.

					ELAINE
			Could you please give him a message?
			Could you tell him to call home
			immediately?  And could you also tell
			him -
				(at full power)
			I know what's going on.

					ESTRELLA
			Alright.  Okay.  But I'm just going to
			say this, and I'm going to stand by
			it.
				(can't help herself)
			You should be really proud of him.
			'Cause I know guys... and I'll bet you
			do too.  And he respects women, and he
			likes women, and let's just pause and
			appreciate a man like that.   You
			created him out of thin air, and you
			raised him right, and we're all looking
			out for him.  And that's more than
			I've ever said to my own parents, so
			there you go.
				(silence)
			This is the maid speaking, by the way.

	68    INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT						68

	Russell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in
	the hotel lobby.  William shuffles through many pages of
	questions written in small script.  His tape recorder microphone
	sits balanced on the chair.

					WILLIAM
				(very professional)
			Now that you're starting to be
			successful, you had twenty-six years
			to write your first Album... and you'll
			have maybe four months for the second.
			Do you worry that the pressure of the
			business will get in the way of the
			original joy of making your music?  Or
			-

	Russell blinks.  The all-consuming issues of his life are right
	in front of him.

					RUSSELL
			Whoa!
				(laughing)
			I need three more beers and my guitar
			before I can answer that question.
			Let's take a walk.

	69    EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - NIGHT					69

	Russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William.
	William follows him through the sliding glass door to his room,
	facing the pool.  Russell grabs his guitar.  They stand for a
	moment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait
	twenty yards in front of them.  The off-limits after-hours
	pool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members.
	Jeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby.  Dick laughs at a joke.
	Always the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels
	from a maid cart.  And she is the first to slip into the pool
	for some after-hours, against-the-rules swimming.  Effortlessly,
	she turns a collection of people into a party.  They regard
	her, well out of earshot of the others.

					RUSSELL
			For a minute I thought you were actually
			a real journalist... which is... you
			know, it's great.
				(beat)
			Shut that thing off, and I'll tell you
			the truth.

	William shuts his tape recorder off.

					WILLIAM
			It's off.

					RUSSELL
			Look.  I trust you.  I'm going to lay
			this right on you.  Just make us look
			cool.

					WILLIAM
			I will quote you warmly and accurately.

					RUSSELL
			That's what I'm worried about.  See -
			some of us have girlfriends back home.
			Some of us have wives.  And... some of
			the people you meet on the road are
			really amazing people...

	They both watch Penny Lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool.
	She places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting
	all, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Like you.  And some of the things that
			happen are good for just a few people
			to know about - as opposed to, say, a
			million people.

	Dawn is breaking for William.

					WILLIAM
			Ohhhh.  Oh.  Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			You know what I mean?

					WILLIAM
			Right.  Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			See, you're dangerous.  Most people
			are just waiting to talk, but you
			listen.

					WILLIAM
			Right.  Right.

					RUSSELL
			So your question you asked me.  I think
			about It every fucking night.  The
			"business."  I hate it!
				(quietly)
			I grew up with these guys, okay?  I
			can't play all that I can play, I'm
			past these musicians, do you understand?

					WILLIAM
			I do.

					RUSSELL
			The more popular we get, the more I
			can't walk on them, the bigger their
			houses get, the more pressure... you
			forget, man.  You forget what it was
			like to be real, to be a fan.  You can
			hear it in a lot of bands who've been
			successful - it doesn't sound like
			music anymore.  It sounds like...
			like lifestyle maintenance.
				(suddenly confessional)
			I used to be able to hear the sounds
			of the world.  Everything, to me, used
			to sound like music.  Everything.  Now
			I don't hear it.   You know what I'm
			trying to say?

					WILLIAM
				(ruefully)
			Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			Man, it feels good to say this stuff
			out loud.  But what am I doing?  I'm
			telling secrets to the one guy you
			don't tell secrets to.

					WILLIAM
				(feeling included)
			No, that's okay.  We'll do the interview
			tomorrow.

					RUSSELL
			This is good.  So there's the "friend"
			and then there's the "interview guy."

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			So tonight it's "friend".... and when
			we wake up tomorrow - "interview guy."
			We'll figure it out as we go, buddy.

					WILLIAM
			Hey - for whatever it's worth - you
			guys are really good.

	Russell laughs at the kid's easy naivete.  He hands his guitar
	to the kid, and joins the party.  William watches, part of the
	crowd... somehow feeling a little compromised.  He doesn't
	care.  Penny gestures for him to join them.

	70    EXT. SUN STADIUM - AFTERNOON					70

	William interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena.  On
	stage, Ed soundchecks his drums.

					WILLIAM
			How would you describe your role in
			Stillwater?  What is the chemical that
			you add to the chemistry?

					LARRY
			I'm the bass-player.

					WILLIAM
				(pressing for some poetry)
			Right.  And when you take that away...
			what would be missing?  Stylistically?
			What chemical?

					LARRY
				(not getting it)
			The bass?

	Larry doesn't give him much.

	71    EXT. SUN STADIUM - NIGHT						 71

	It's raining.  The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part
	of them.  Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look.  She takes the scarf
	from around his neck and ties it around his leg.  He looks
	instantly better.  William watches in the darkness as Dick
	takes the microphone.  The best part of his day has arrived.
	In his important voice:

					DICK
			Good evening Phoenix.
				(applause)
			From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome,
			Stillwater.

	Lights come up, as the band launches into "Fever Dog."   Jeff
	begins singing.  Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for
	a back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected.

	A sharp electrical shock.

	It's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a
	moment something is clearly wrong.  Russell holds onto the
	microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage
	for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal.  His
	face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage,
	collapsing a couple steps later.

	72    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT						72

	Dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has
	been pulled up into the backstage area.   He guides a sagging
	Russell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus.

					DICK
			Get in, get in!!

	William boards the bus, as the extremely agitated PROMOTER
	arrives to confront Dick.

					PROMOTER
			Are you the manager of this band?

					DICK
			That, and more.  Get in!

					PROMOTER
			You didn't even play a full set!

	Dick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing
	with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand.

					DICK
			Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed
			our guitarist!

					PROMOTER
			You trashed the dressing room - you
			didn't play your thirty-five minutes.
			You didn't fulfill your contract -

					DICK
			Everybody in!  Get in the bus!

					PROMOTER
			I'll report you to every promoter in
			the country!  I'm gonna talk to Frank
			Barcelona!

					DICK
			YOU DON'T FUCK WITH MY BAND'S SAFETY!

					PROMOTER
			I hope you have a good lawyer.

					DICK
			I AM A LAWYER!

	He swings into the bus, as the bus revs.

					PROMOTER
			LOCK THE GATE ON 'EM!

	73    INT. BUS -- NIGHT							73

	Russell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus.  He
	examines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the
	positivity of her words.

					PENNY
			Don't worry.  It's happened to all the
			greats.  Thank God you didn't hold the
			mike stand with both hands, you'd still
			be holding it.  This is a good thing.
			It's a good, good, good thing.

	William sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye-
	sight of others.  The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes
	to see that he's writing in his notebook.

	Dick swings into the seat across from Russell.  The bus door
	shuts, as the promoter is still yelling.

	Doris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running
	alongside.  She knocks on the window next to William.

					ESTRELLA
			I forgot to tell you!  Your mom says
			to call home immediately.  She says
			she knows what's going on!
				(receding)
			See you guys in Topeka!  I'll catch a
			ride with Sabbath!

	William nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races
	toward the now closing gate.

					DICK
				(casually, to Russell)
			Wanna buy a gate?

	Before Russell can answer - BASH.  Doris barrels through the
	steel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside
	this bus.

					DICK (cont'd)
			You just bought a gate.
				(to the bus)
			C'mon Doris!!  Get us out of town!!

	The bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for
	Doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a
	thoroughfare.

					WILLIAM
			What did it feel like to be
			electrocuted?

					RUSSELL
			It burns.  It feels like a dose of
			lead shooting through your body... and
			then you see God, and he says, "How
			bad do you want to be legendary?" And
			god damnit.  I let go.
				(shaky grin as all laugh
			warmly)
			Rock and roll.

	Jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy.  The kid
	scribbles in his notebook.  We hear Led Zeppelin's "That's the
	Way."

	74    INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING						74

	Song continues.  Almost everybody is asleep.  William takes
	the camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny.  She wakes
	up.

					PENNY
			Give that to me.

	She grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight.  He grabs some
	other Polaroids from her pocket.  He hustles to the back of
	the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the
	passing landscapes.  She chases him down the aisle.  Music
	continues as she sits down next to him.  Out the window, a
	long-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus
	for a bit.  They wave.  Penny watches them over sunglasses,
	waves briefly to the real world.

					PENNY (cont'd)
				(breathing heavy, owning
			the world)
			When we go to Morocco, I think we should
			wear completely different clothes, and
			be completely different people.

					WILLIAM
			What will our names be?

	She snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets
	the Polaroid.  She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping.
	Her attention has already wandered from Morocco.

					PENNY
			What do you think of Russell?

					WILLIAM
			I like him.

					PENNY
			You're coming to Cleveland, right?

					WILLIAM
			Cleveland, Ohio?  Oh no no no.  I gotta
			get my interview with Russell before
			Greenville.  And you've got to help
			me.  Okay?  Friends... remember?

	Penny is still watching Russell.

					PENNY
			You should give him a break.  There
			are real problems in the band.   Off
			the record.

	Gravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins Penny in
	watching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping
	restlessly up ahead.

					WILLIAM
			What problems?

					PENNY
			Okay.  I got it.  I think your name
			should be Spencer, and mine will be
			Jane.

					WILLIAM
			I can't keep up with you.

					PENNY
			No one can.

					WILLIAM
			What's your real name?

	She looks at him briefly.  She puts her arm around him.  It's
	intoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act.  With her
	free hand, she gestures with a hanger.  As they regard Russell
	sleeping nearby:

					PENNY
			Here's the thing about Russell.  He's
			my last project.  I only do this for a
			very few people.  And I think we should
			do it together - he is almost great.
			We've got to take him there.  You and
			me - we can do it.  Deal?  Because the
			other guys are good - but he could be
			great.  He's my last project.

	He looks at her.  She imitates his face back to him.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			It's all happening.

	75    INT. TOPEKA ARENA BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT				75

	William sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases.

					WILLIAM
			What do you love about music?

	Ed looks at him thoughtfully.  It is an eloquent moment.  He
	thinks.  He shrugs.  The kid tumbles with more questions.
	These interviews are not going well.

	76    INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT						76

	William, looking concerned over the state of his interviews,
	walks into the backstage bathroom.  He makes a few surreptitious
	notes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing
	there, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered
	by a Local Hanger-On.  Seeing the kid, he immediately hides
	the coke spoon.

					JEFF
			Hey.

					WILLIAM
			Hey.

	William pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal,
	and shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little
	worried.

	77    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT					77

	William is on the pay phone with his Mother.  The show booms
	in the background.

					WILLIAM
			I know.  I know.  I know.
				(beat)
			I know.  Mom.  Mom... Mom.

	78    INT. STAGE - NIGHT						78

	Stillwater on-stage.  A great show.  Russell on fire.

	79    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT					79

	William on the phone.  Estrella leans on him, fixing her shoe.

					WILLIAM
			Right now -- Topeka.  Then Greenville.
			Then home.

	He winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a
	moment.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			I'm sorry I didn't call yesterday!
			It's not like you can just carry a
			phone around with you.

	80    INT. ELAINE'S SCHOOL OFFICE -- AFTERNOON				80

	Mom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home
	- a fortress in which she is surrounded by books.  The sun is
	going down.  She can't resist a sentimental moment.

					ELAINE
			I guess I just miss you, and I don't
			understand why I've driven both my
			kids so far away from me.  By all
			practical rules don't I get you for
			three more years?

	He is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever,
	as music continues in b.g.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Was I not fun?

	81    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE -- NIGHT					81

	William has his finger in his ear.  The din if Stillwater's
	set now blots out all other noise.  It is not the time to answer
	this question.

					WILLIAM
			I missed the last thing you said.

	Mom takes a pause.

					ELAINE
			I LOVE YOU.

	Penny now enters, watching.

					WILLIAM
			WHAT?

					ELAINE
				(angry, louder)
			I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU!

	William now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad
	from a paper dish.  Looking at her, he lets loose with what he
	believes is a private confession.

					WILLIAM
			I LOVE YOU!!

	Penny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another
	backstage pass, and turns away.  Camera stays on William.  He
	is suddenly and deeply embarrassed.  He's just told her that
	he loves her and she knows it.  He hangs up, traumatized.

	82    INT. TOPEKA DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT				82

	Russell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished.
	He is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders.   Luggage
	for the next city is stacked by the door.

					RUSSELL
			Fire away.  I'm ready.  I'm on the
			"You" Train.  Take me there.

	The kid plugs in his microphone.  Russell listens as he springs
	his first question.

					WILLIAM
			Do you have to be depressed to write a
			sad song?  Do you have to be in love
			to write a love song?  Is a song better
			if it really happened to you?  Like,
			"If You Say Nothing"... where did you
			write that and how did it come about?

	Russell admires the many questions.  Says nothing.  He looks
	at his hand, thinks.

					RUSSELL
			When did you get so professional?

	In the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt.
	Grinning, she cuffs his shoulder.  To the shirtless silent
	drummer, waiting for his shirt.

					PENNY
			I'm almost done with my shirt.

	Ed watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber
	pad.  Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap.  In
	the corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being
	underappreciated.  And now Dick enters with a large cardboard
	box.

					DICK
			Russell, your dad showed up again.
			And on a lighter note.
				(importantly)
			Gentlemen.  Your first t-shirts have
			arrived.

	There is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the
	box filled with new white t-shirts.  He untangles the first fresh
	shirt, and displays it proudly.  A silent beat as all examine it -
	their first t-shirt.  Faces fall.  Ed stops drumming.  There has
	been a mistake.  It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name
	emblazoned below.  Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored-
	in and emphasized on the shirt.  He turns away, making a noise.
	Jeff stares at the t-shirt.  He's just about in tears.  There is
	a long silence and then... Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.

					DICK (cont'd)
			It's the record company's mistake.
			And they will pay.  Shirts gone, band
			happy.

	He drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were
	contaminated, and exits with the box.  William watches as the
	two men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room.
	Russell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff.  The vibe is thick.
	Russel turns to see Jeff staring at him.

					RUSSELL
			Can we just skip the vibe and go
			straight to us laughing about this?

					JEFF
				(bitterly)
			Yeah.  Okay.

					RUSSELL
				(trying for a joke)
			Because I can see by your face - you
			want to get into this -

					JEFF
			How can you tell?  I'm just one of the
			out-of-focus guys.

					RUSSELL
			Here we go.

	William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Here.  Take it.  You LOVE this shirt -
			it lets you say everything you want to
			say.

					JEFF
			Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.

					RUSSELL
			It's a t-shirt.

	Russell turns away.

					JEFF
			I'm always gonna tell you the truth.

					RUSSELL
			Are you doing coke again?

					JEFF
			Oh yeah.  All the time.

	The kid looks down.

					JEFF (cont'd)
			This is big stuff, man.  From the very
			beginning -- we said -- I'm the front
			man and you're the guitarist with
			mystique.  That's the dynamic we agreed
			on -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith.  But
			somehow it's all turning around.  We
			have got to control what's happening
			to us.  There's a responsibility here -

					RUSSELL
			Excuse me, but didn't we all get into
			this to avoid responsibility?

					JEFF
			Forgive me.
				(continuing, on shirt)
			But this is the slow-moving train of
			compromise that will kill us.

	Russell makes a disgusted noise.  Penny Lane exits discreetly,
	looking back at William.

					JEFF (cont'd)
			I can't say anymore with a writer here.

					RUSSELL
			You can trust him,  you can say whatever
			you want.

					JEFF
				(eyes suddenly moist)
			I works as hard or harder than anybody
			on that stage.  You know what I do - I
			connect.  I get people off.  I look
			for the guy who isn't getting off, and
			I make him get off.
				(beat)
			Actually, that you can print.
				(continues to Russell)
			And yet, why do I always end up feeling
			like I'm a joke to you?  I feel nothing
			but love for you.  We're a family.

	He looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry.  Embarrassed, he
	grows angrier.

					JEFF (cont'd)
			You want to pretend this isn't going
			to be a very big band.  Well it is.  You
			call yourself a leader of this band, but
			your direction allowed the t-shirt, when
			you allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause
			he's your friend... don't you see?  The
			t-shirt is everything.  It's everything.

					RUSSELL
			Is it my turn?  Because I think we
			should, for once, say what we really
			mean.

					JEFF
			Oh, this is the part where you quit -

					RUSSELL
				(stiffening)
			Right.  I'm so predictable.

					JEFF
			No  I gotta tell the truth -- I want
			you to like me.  But sometimes I feel
			like you collect people who love you
			and then very skillfully... you make
			them feel bad that they're not good
			enough for you.

					RUSSELL
			Stick to singing, brother, 'cause you
			ain't gonna make it as a shrink.

					JEFF
			Deal with it!  And let me just say
			what nobody Else wants to say to you -

					RUSSELL
			What?

					JEFF
			Your looks have become a problem.

	82A   EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT						 82A

	Russell walks swiftly past a happy silver-haired man, who holds
	court with beer in hand.  He dresses too young for his age,
	late fifties.  He is DAD.

					DAD
			Son!

					RUSSELL
				(dutifully)
			Hello Harry.

	Dad introduces a woman much younger, who eyes Russell hungrily.

					DAD
			He got all the good genes, huh?  Meet
			Deirdre.  We're getting married in
			July.

	83    EXT. ARENA -- NIGHT						83

	Russell walks fast outside the arena.  William hustles to catch
	up.  The two men walk in long silent strides in the cold night
	air, beyond the backstage area.  Fans begin to recognize and
	follow at a discreet distance.

					WILLIAM
			You okay?  You alright?

	Russell doesn't answer.

					RUSSELL
				(resolute, wound up)
			From here on out, I'm only interested
			in what's real.

	The kid nods.  They walk.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Real feelings.  Real people.  That's
			all I'm interested in...  From here on
			out.  What is REAL?   You're real.

					WILLIAM
			Thanks.

	A wave of warmth comes over Russell.

					RUSSELL
			You know, you know all about us and I
			don't know shit about you.
				(struggling to be personal)
			What's your... your family like?  Tell
			me.

					WILLIAM
			Well, my dad died of a heart attack
			and my sister believes that my Mom is
			so intense that she might have
			contributed to it.  Plus -

					RUSSELL
				(immediately)
			Okay, that's good.  That's enough.

					WILLIAM
			It's good to talk about it.  Really
			good.

	Russel now sees some hero worship in the kid's face, and it
	makes him nervous.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			Hey, man, maybe we should go back.

					RUSSELL
			If they want me, they can find me.

	William turns and sees nobody following but fans.

					WILLIAM
			So listen.  I have to go home tomorrow.
			I know this is a bad time to finish
			our interview.

					RUSSELL
			Hey, man, you know what?  Write whatever
			you want.  I trust you.

	A big square Chevy van slows down.  A CONCERT-GOER hands his
	head out the window.

					CONCERT-GOER
				(battle-cry)
			Woooooooooo!!!  You're Russel from
			Stillwater!!

					RUSSELL
			On my better days, yes.  I am "Woooooo,
			Russell from Stillwater!"

					CONCERT-GOER
			Wanna go to a party at my friend Aaron's
			house?!  I know you're a big rock star,
			but do you want to hang with some people
			looking to have a good time?

	Russel regards the van full of kids.  More fans crowding
	around.  The kid behind the wheel unknowingly says the magic
	words.

					CONCERT-GOER (cont'd)
			We're just real Topeka people, man.

	He has said the magic word.

	A84   EXT. AARON'S PARTY - NIGHT					A84

	Russell arrives at the party in the rural outskirts of Topeka.
	William nearby.

	84    INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT					84

	William watches as Russell slugs from a Jack Daniels bottle.
	They sit in the bedroom of a mindblown fan, 17 year-old AARON.
	He has long frizzy brown hair, tied in a spray behind him.
	Many from the neighborhood are now pouring into the home.

					RUSSELL
				(eyes glowing)
			You.  Aaron.  Are what it's all about.
			You are real.  Your room is real.
			Your friends are real.  You are more
			important than... than... all the silly
			machinery.  And you know it!  In eleven
			years it's gonna be 1984, man.  Think
			about that!

					AARON
			Wanna see me feed a mouse to my snake?

					RUSSELL
			Yes.

					KID # 1
			Can I have your belt?

					RUSSELL
			Take it!

	Russel whips off his belt, gives it to the fan.  A joint goes
	by, headed for Russell.  William intercepts it and passes it
	on.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Aaron?  Where's your bathroom?  I want
			to live here. I want to eat your food,
			and live in your city and fuckin rock
			like I used to.  I want to learn
			everything there is to know about your
			city and your town.  And your way of
			being real.
				(stunning realization)
			I used to be you.

					AARON
			Down the hall by the washing machine.

					RUSSELL
			What?

					AARON
			The bathroom.

					RUSSELL
			Okay.  Good to know.

	Russell rises and squeezes past fans and heads down the hall.

	85    INT. AARON'S HALLWAY - NIGHT					85

	William follows Russell protectively.

					PASSING FAN # 1
			WOOOOOOO!!

	A QUIET GIRL, 14, turns and watches Russell pass.  We linger
	on her face for just a moment, full of wonder.

					WILLIAM
			We should probably head back sometime.

	Russell ignores him.

					PASSING FAN # 2
				(holding red cup)
			Watch out, there's acid in the beer
			that's in the Red cups.

	Russell looks at the cup in his own hand.  It's white.  Then,
	with his other hand, he grabs the red cup and drains it.
	William winces.  They move on.

					RUSSELL
			Topeka.  Check it out.

	Russell enters the bathroom.  William stands guard.  With a
	finger outstretched from each hand, he lectures the fans massing
	in the hallway.

					WILLIAM
			Please don't give him any more acid.

	86    INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER			86

	William watches as a wobbly Russell Hammond, in sunglasses
	now, goes through Aaron's record collection.  He places the
	albums over his face, like masks.

					RUSSELL
			Faces.  Stones.  Sa-weet Baby James!!
			None of these people are gonna be around
			in twenty years!  Plastic begets
			plastic!!   Black plastic.

	Partygoers are strangely fascinated by the rock star in their
	living room.

								 INTERCUT:

	87    INT. BACK BEDROOM -- NIGHT					87

	William waits anxiously to use the phone, keeping an eye on
	Russell.  Russell is now strangely twisting/dancing with four
	girls in the living room, as more cars arrive outside.

					KID ON PHONE
			He's here right now!  Go ahead and put
			it Out over the radio, tell people to
			bring food And beer and chicks.  We're
			at Rural Route # 4 -

					WILLIAM
			No no.  Nope.  No.

	William takes the phone and hangs up.  Keeping an eye on Russell
	in the next room, he dials from a tour itinerary sheet.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			Dick Roswell, please?
				(beat)
			Dick!!  I got him!!  He's okay... I've
			been Looking after him.  He's on acid,
			though.  I can't Really tell.  How do
			you know when it's "kicked in?"

	88    EXT. AARON'S BACKYARD - NIGHT					88

	Russel stands on the jutting corner of the house rooftop.
	The unlit, unheated greenish family pool beckons to him below.
	It's kicked in.

					RUSSELL
				(bellowing to the heavens)
			I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!

	Russell cackles at the joke of it all.  William yells up from
	down below.

					WILLIAM
			Hey Russell -

					RUSSELL
			I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!

					WILLIAM
			Don't jump, okay?

					RUSSELL
			And you can tell Rolling Stone Magazine
			my last words were -

	He spreads his arms, and tries to think of last words.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			-- I'm on drugs!!

	The kids cheer.  William looks around, remains cool.  Yells
	upward in the cold night air.

					WILLIAM
			I think we should work on those last
			words.

					RUSSELL
			Critic!!

					WILLIAM
			No, I'm not -

					RUSSELL
			Okay I got it.  I got it.  I got it.
			I got it.   This is better.  Last words
			-
				(spreads his arms, his
			greatest realization)
			I DIG MUSIC!!

	It gets a skimpy reaction from the partygoers.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
				(immediately)
			I'm on drugs!!

	They applaud again.

					WILLIAM
			Just come on down!!

					RUSSELL
				(matter-of-fact)
			Okay.

	He jumps from the roof into the cold, algaed water below.  He
	sinks immediately.  One kid jumps in, then another, then more.

	Everybody wants to save Russell.

	89    EXT. AARON'S NEIGHBORHOOD -- EARLY MORNING			89

	It's getting lighter.  Cars line the street.  And now, finally
	turning the corner, is Doris the Bus.

	90    INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING						90

	William watches the effects of personal charisma.  Wet
	partygoers surround Russell, bottle of Jack Daniels still in
	hand,  wrapped in towels.  Now a bond has passes between them,
	all of them.  Algae drips from the corner of Russell's face
	and neck.

					RUSSELL
			Thanks for saving my life.  I won't
			hold it against you.

	Twenty different kids thank him for the opportunity.  ("Glad
	to do it," "Right on," "Damn straight.")

	91    INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN -- MORNING				91

	Door opens.  Dick enters.  Finding the guitarist in the kitchen,
	he clicks into time-tested road-managerial maintenance.  Easing
	Russell out of his towel, slipping his own jacket around him,
	from Russell's hands.

					DICK
				(privately)
			They've been crying for you like a
			bunch of whimpering pussies --

					RUSSELL
				(woozy)
			The band is over.  This is my family
			now.

					OTHERS
			Right on.  He's staying with us.

					DICK
				(soothing)
			Definitely.  It's all over.  We'll
			just ride on to Greenville, listen to
			some great music, finish the tour, and
			leave those ungrateful fools behind.
			And then we'll come back here, where
			you'll live.

					RUSSELL
			I know what you're doing... and I like
			it.
				(noticing William)
			Look at him.  He's taking notes with
			his eyes.
				(beat, to Dick)
			How do we know he's not a cop?

	William laughs painfully, as Russell moves in, eyes flaring
	with sudden paranoia.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			He could be selling information!

					DICK
				(to Russell)
			Easy.  He's your Guardian Angel.

	Russell turns away.  William shrugs with style, but his
	lingering look is filled with hurt.  Dick guides Russell to
	the door, grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as
	they move.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Don't worry.  He only means half of
			what he says.

					WILLIAM
			Which half?

					DICK
			Good question.

					WILLIAM
				(very direct)
			I have a lot more.  Just help me get
			my interview so I can go home from
			Greenville.  I have to go home.
				(pulls him back)
			I have to go home.

					DICK
			Hey.  You saved the tour.   That's
			good enough for now.

	Frustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of
	Russell's wet clothes. William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes
	and smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the
	partygoer who also wears his belt.  They move to the door in a
	pack.  We hear the beginning of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer."
	Dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important"
	stage voice.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Ladies and Gentlemen, the evening is
			over!  We hope you've enjoyed
			yourselves, and we'll See you again in
			1974!!  Good evening!!

	William gives Russell his sunglasses to face the sunlight.
	Russell stumbles out of the house to great cheers.  The Quiet
	Girl breaks free to catch Russell on the way out.

					QUIET GIRL
			I'll never forget you.

	Dick pats William's arm one more time -- good work.  They leave
	Aaron's house as legends.

	92    INT. TOUR BUS -- MORNING - 5 AM					92

	"Tiny Dancer" continues on the bus stereo.  Russell sits up
	front, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent.   The others
	have given him a wide berth.  He feels silly, and they know
	it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel
	foolish.  He sits silently.  William watches him from four
	rows back, next to Penny.  She kisses the top of his forehead,
	a hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins.  There is
	only more silence.  Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or
	two, fighting the quiet and singing along.  Then others...
	waking up... joining in.  Then Jeff.  Russell hears them and
	starts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around.
	It's a voice everyone wants to hear.  Like it or not, this is
	his family.

									FADE OUT

	FADE IN:

	93    EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY						93

	Passing signs announce Greenville, North Carolina.

	94    INT. LESTER BANGS BEDROOM - DAY					94

	Lester on the phone.  He is paler than ever, in a room clogged
	with vinyl, happily listening to the MC5 in the background.

					LESTER
			How's it going?

								 INTERCUT:

	95    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY					95

	It's a small wooden-walled hotel room in Greenville.  Polexia
	tries on clothes.  William barely notices as he talks to Lester
	on the phone.

					WILLIAM
			Rolling Stone is calling me.  I don't
			have my key interview.  I don't know
			what to say.

					LESTER BANGS
				(pacing, assembling thoughts
			with his hands)
			You're flipping out.  That's good.
			Alright.  This is how you blow their
			minds.  He'll ask you - this is Ben
			Fong-Torres, right? - he'll ask you
			how the story's going.  Here's what
			you do - let's fry his mind.  Tell him
			"it's a think piece about a mid-level
			band struggling with their own
			limitations in the harsh face of
			stardom."  Ha ha!!  This is fun!

	William scrambles to make notes.

					WILLIAM
				(madly copying)
			... think... piece...

	CLOSE ON WRITING

	Longhand small script on yellow legal tablets.

	96    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT					96

	William sits in the tub, without water.  It's his makeshift
	office, he's surrounded with scraps of notepaper.  He writes
	savagely, and now, savagely throws it away.

	97    INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NIGHT					97

	In the bedroom, Sapphire, Polexia and Penny watch The Midnight
	Special.  Sapphire looks at a room service menu.

					SAPPHIRE
			It says the food is hearty and
			adventurous.

					POLEXIA
				(yawns)
			Greenville.  I'm bored.

	Penny yawns too, it's catchy, and rises to visit the bathroom.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Hey let's deflower the kid.

	Now Sapphire yawns, looks in her purse.

					SAPPHIRE
			Who his the quaaludes from me?

	98    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT					98

	Penny enters to see William writing in the tub.  She sits on
	the toilet to pee.  Flustered:

					WILLIAM
			Wait.  I'll leave.

	He gets up, knocking his carefully organized notes onto the
	floor.  He is brimming with things to say.  More than he is
	even able to communicate.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			You know, I think this is going
			backwards for me.

					PENNY
			Backwards?

					WILLIAM
				(flustered)
			I don't know.  I just thought we could
			hang out, maybe do some stuff back
			home, regular stuff, get to know each
			other better... and then I'd see you
			pee.  I mean, that's the way I usually
			do it.

					PENNY
			You're one of us.  It's no big deal.

					WILLIAM
			I'm not one of you.

					PENNY
			Oh!  If you go to Cleveland, Bowie's
			going to be there at Swingo's, the
			greatest hotel in America.  I'll
			introduce you to him, and his security
			guy Dennis.

	William stops at the door.

					WILLIAM
			Don't you have any regular friends?

					PENNY
			Famous people are just more interesting.

	He looks at her.  Even sitting on the can, she's elegant and
	totally focused on him.

					WILLIAM
				(carefully)
			Well, I would be worried that they
			were using me.  And not that anybody's
			using you, but -

	She swoons a little, touched and moved.

					PENNY
			Boy, if this was the real world and
			some guy talked to me like that -

					WILLIAM
			Let me finish.
				(continuing)
			I'm not famous.... but you could always
			use me.   If anything happens.  And I
			would never use you.  Even if I got
			famous.  So you know, you always have
			that from me... in the real world.  If
			you ever have to go back there, for
			anything.

	She looks at him curiously, as the door blasts open.  Sapphire
	and Polexia head for William.

					SAPPHIRE
			Your time has come.

					WILLIAM
			Did he call?
				(realizes their intention)
			What are you -- stop it -- we're talking
			here.

					SAPPHIRE
			Pants him.  Opie must die.

	They swarm him, dragging him kicking into the bedroom.

	99    INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NIGHT					99

	Steely Dan, looking pale and somehow snappy, perform "Do It
	Again" on The Midnight Special.  The girls force William onto
	the bed, and envelope him.  Their sexuality is fun, untroubled.
	Shot moves past bodies crossing frame, onto William's face.

	ANGLE ON PENNY

	Across room, sitting and watching.

					SAPPHIRE
			Just relax.  Take a vacation from
			yourself.  Leave this to professionals.

	Estrella and Polexia kiss each other playfully.  William looks
	confused.  Across the room, Penny laughs, turns up the TV,
	blows him a kiss.

	Penny's eyes.  Across the room.

	His eyes.

	His sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them, but
	to him it's an embarrassingly  intense moment he shares only
	with Penny Lane -- across the room.  She turns away, smiling,
	disappears into the next room.

	ON STEELY DAN

	On the television.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	99A  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - HANDHELD		99A

	Post-sex pajama party.  Sapphire, Estrella, and Polexia girltalk
	about their first rock and roll conquests.  Penny is conspicuous
	by her absence.  William is under the sheets, listening, feeling
	different, now a man and somehow one of the girls too.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	100   INT. BEDROOOM -- NEXT MORNING					100

	William is awake.  Sunlight floods in from the corners of the
	window-shades.  He is surrounded by the fallen cavalry of the
	night before... Sapphire and Polexia.  The phone rings, and
	Sapphire instantly snaps it up, still asleep.  Lost in her
	dreams, she offers the sexiest hello ever.

					SAPPHIRE
				(half-English accent)
			Hello.  Hi, Ben-Fong-Torres from Rolling
			Stone.

	William snatches the phone.

					WILLIAM
				(lowers voice)
			Hello.

	101   INT. BEN FONG-TORRES' KITCHEN -- SATURDAY MORNING			101

	Ben Fong-Torres is up bright and early.

					BEN
			Hello William, this is your editor at --

	He offers the name of the magazine with a swirl that implies
	high-level importance.

					BEN (cont'd)
			Rolling Stone.  How's the story?

	INT. GREENVILLE HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

	William snaps into his very professional tone of equally grave
	importance.

					WILLIAM
			I'm getting good stuff out here.

					BEN
			Sounds like it.

	Next to him, Polexia yawns herself awake.

					POLEXIA
			Man, I need some -

	He clamps a hand over her mouth.

					BEN
				(jocular but tough)
			Now listen.  Get it together.  We're
			both professionals, I don't have to
			tell you this.  You're not out there
			to join the party -- we already have
			one Hunter Thompson.  You're out there
			to interview and Report.  You got me?
			This isn't Creem Magazine, it's Rolling
			Stone.  We need this story in four
			days.  Now I want to know how it's
			shaping up.

					WILLIAM
			It's a think-piece about a mid-level
			band grappling with their limitations
			in the face of the harsh glare of
			success.

					BEN
				(pause)
			I like what we're saying.  Let me try
			and get you a thousand more words.
			It's in consideration for the cover,
			but don't tell the band.

					WILLIAM
				(conflicted)
			Crazy.

	The kid hangs up, now shouldering even more pressure.  He
	unclamps Polexia's mouth.

					POLEXIA
			- coffee.

					SAPPHIRE
			Me too.  Greenville is so boring.
				(to William)
			Any other city in the world and you'd
			still be a virgin.

					WILLIAM
			I'm going out to find Russell.

					SAPPHIRE
			Will you take the laundry?

					WILLIAM
				(to the girls)
			What am I to you?  Tell me right now!
			What. Am.  I.  To.  You.

	102   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY						102

	Circles have sprouted up under William's eyes.  The orange bag
	strapped over his shoulder, he lugs a huge bag of laundry.  He
	consults room list.  A variety of noises and smells drift from
	the band rooms.  He sees Room Service arrive at Dick's door,
	and it's Estrella who opens the door.  (Dick in the
	background.)  She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning --
	as the door shuts.

					WILLIAM
			Houdini... Houdini...

	He arrives at Russell's door.  Two exclamation points have
	been Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign
	is gaffer-taped to his door.  He looks through the crack, at
	the bottom of the door.  Carefully and politely, he knocks.
	Instantly:

					RUSSELL (O.S.)
			GO AWAY!

	Pissed, the kid flips off the door.  He sits down on a chair
	directly across from the room.  Push in on William, who is
	more pent-up than ever.  He tries hard not to cry, taking
	gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past, revealing... he's
	failed.  He cries.

	FADE UP FROM DARKNESS

	A super-energized Russell Hammond looks into William's sleepy
	face.  William's eyes open.  His own sleepy face is evident in
	Russell's sunglasses.  The bag of laundry is still at his feet.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			We'll do the interview in Cleveland!

					WILLIAM
			No.  I can't.  You've got to help me.
			I have to go home.

					RUSSELL
			Come on man, we'll have more time there.
			Don't be tense!!

	He begins rubbing the kid's shoulders.  He's waking up.  There's
	Penny, also rubbing his shoulders.  It is degrading... and
	somehow cool too.

					WILLIAM
				(to Penny)
			You said you'd help me.

					PENNY
				(massaging)
			Come to Cleveland.

					RUSSELL
				(massaging, hypnotically)
			Come to Cleveland... Come to
			Cleveland...

					WILLIAM
			I can't!!

					RUSSELL
			Can we help it if we like having you
			around!

	William is a bundle of nerves and exhaustion now.  Embarrassed
	and frustrated.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Cleveland, my man.  You can't miss out
			on the Rock Mecca of the midwest -
			you're with us.  It's all happening!

					PENNY
			Rock and roll!

					WILLIAM
				(weary)
			Rock and roll.

	We hear David Bowie's live version of "Waiting for the Man."

	103   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAY						103

	They sit together, hair askew, in sunglasses, resting against
	the headboard.  Carefully, Russell identifies his thoughts.

					RUSSELL
			I feel... like his parents.

	Penny runs a worried hand through her hair.

					PENNY
			I know.

					RUSSELL
			I wonder how that happened.

					PENNY
			You ever notice that all our sentences
			begin with "I?"

					RUSSELL
			I hadn't, no.

					PENNY
			'Cause we should work on that.

	He looks at her, plays the guitar a little.

	104   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT						104

	Night.  Doris rocks toward Cleveland on a muggy summer night.
	The windows of passing houses offer rich Edward Hopper glimpses
	of lives and people William will never meet.

	105   INT. WILLIAM'S BUS BUNK - NIGHT					105

	William watches from his bus bunk at the back, head on elbow.
	Looking up, he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the
	mattress above him, as music continues.

	William gets up, nods hello to the Roadie and his Date on the
	bunk above.  He moves down the aisle... to the seats near the
	front.  A sleeping Russell sits upright, hugging his guitar.
	Penny asleep next to him, Polaroid in her hand of... Russell
	sleeping.  The kid moves on.  He sits with the Bus Driver,
	whose CB crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to
	Cleveland.

	ON THE FIRST SIGN - LATE NIGHT

	Cleveland signs.  Music rises.  Heads pop awake.

					RUSSELL
			Cleveland!

	106   EXT. DOWNTOWN CLEVELAND - LATE NIGHT				106

	Like a slow-moving shark, Doris pulls into empty downtown
	Cleveland.  The streets are empty.  They pass the Agoura
	Ballroom, where a man with a long stick arranges the letters
	Stillwater on the marquee.   Applause in the bus.

	107   INT. SWINGO'S CELEBRITY INN - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING		107

	Russell and band enter like warriors, in a pack.  William sags
	with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder.  Here, in
	the middle of the midwest, is an explosive rock mecca, just as
	promised.   The feeling of belonging invades all those in this
	lobby.  Fans and other touring rockers mingle together.
	Outside in the real world, everyone else is going to work.

					FAN
			It's Bowie!

	The lobby ignites, as William stands near Penny and Russell.
	Bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the
	elevators.  He is shrouded by a jacket.  Just the top of his
	electric red hair travels the lobby, as he's hustled by security
	man Dennis in the elevator.  And out of the chaos comes...

	108   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY						108

	Jeff Bebe and Polexia smash against the wall of the Swingo's
	hotel room, making love.

	109   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY						109

	Russell and Penny Lane smash against their own wall.

	109A  INT. ARENA - NIGHT						109A

	Dick squats at the front of the stage, and talks to a few fans
	in the front row of this crowd.

	110   INT. BACKSTAGE CLEVELAND PAY PHONE - NIGHT			110

	A wild Cleveland crowd in the building.  The cities on this
	tour are getting bigger, and so are the audiences.  And there
	is a whiff of business now too.  Men in satin tour jackets and
	some Disc-jockey types cruise the backstage.  A Hysterical Fan
	is led screaming to the nearby medic room.  Few even react -
	it's Cleveland - as the shot finds William, tired and yawning,
	on the backstage pay phone.  He is absolutely ready for the
	worst.

					WILLIAM
			Hi Mom.  I'm in Cleveland.

	He listens stoically.  Larry and Ed watch nearby.

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

	Moms sits in silence.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
				(rehearsed)
			I'm fine! I'm fine!  I'm flying back on
			Monday Morning.  I'll only miss one
			test.  I'll make it up.

	Russell listens in, holding his guitar, laughing.

					RUSSELL
			Tell her you're a slave to the groove
			- you can't help it!

					WILLIAM
				(covers phone)
			No.

	Russell grabs the phone, talks to the silent mother on the
	other end.

					RUSSELL
			Hi Mom!  It's Russell Hammond, I play
			guitar in Stillwater!   It's my fault.
			How does it feel to be the mother of
			the future of rock journalism?
				(beat)
			Hello?

	Silence.   Penny passes and stands near William, smoothing her
	pass.  They watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road-crew.
	They are more glam, more trashy and less selective.  They glare
	insolently at Penny Lane.  This is the future.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			You've got a great kid -- nothing to
			worry about!  We're taking care of
			him!  And you should come to a show
			sometime!  Join the Circus!

					ELAINE
			Listen to me.   Your charm does not
			work on me.  I'm onto you.  Of course
			you like him.

					RUSSELL
			Yes.

					ELAINE
			He worships you people and that's fine
			with you, as long as he helps make you
			rich.

					RUSSELL
				(a nerve is struck)
			Rich?  I don't think so -

					ELAINE
			Listen to me.  He's a smart, good-
			hearted, 15 year-old kid, with infinite
			potential.

	Russel looks over at the kid, eyes narrowing as he processes
	the truth.  He's 15?

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			This is not some apron-wearing mother
			you're talking to.  I know about your
			Valhalla of Decadence, and I shouldn't
			have let him go.  He is not ready for
			your world of compromised values, and
			diminished brain cells that you throw
			away like confetti.  Am I speaking
			clearly to you?

					RUSSELL
			Yes, ma'am.

					ELAINE
			If you break his spirit, harm him in
			any way, keep him from his chosen
			profession -- which is law, Something
			you may not value but I do -- you will
			meet the voice on the other end of
			this telephone.  And it will not be
			pretty.    Do we understand each other?

					RUSSELL
			Yes... yes...

					ELAINE
				(always the teacher)
			I didn't ask for this role, but I'll
			play it.  Now go do your best.  "Be
			bold and mighty forces will come to
			your aide!"  Goethe said that.  It's
			not too late for you to be a person of
			substance.  Get my son home safely,
			I'm glad we spoke.

	She hangs up.  Russell hangs up, oddly affected and shook up.

					WILLIAM
			Some people get her.  Some don't.

	Russell is still recovering.  William feels embarrassed by his
	mother, once again.

	111   ON THE HUDDLE							111

	William with the band.  He yawns, as the band breaks.  Cleveland
	awaits.  We follow Dick, who guides the band onto the stage
	platform, still in darkness.  Already, stomping and applause
	is mounting.  Russell turns to William before taking the stage:

					RUSSELL
			Your Mom kind of freaked me out.

					WILLIAM
			She means well.

	Still rattled, he takes the stage.  We see the unbridled
	enthusiasm of the faces on the front row.  A wave of cigarette
	lighters stretch out before them.

					DICK
				(importantly)
			From Troy, Michigan...

	Russell thwacks a couple chords.  Audience thunders.  He turns
	to other members, feeling chills.  It's in these moments that
	everything else disappears.  They bow and wave, still in
	darkness... each member seems to have his own fans.  Dick lets
	all this play out before finally adding...

					DICK (cont'd)
			Would you please welcome to Cleveland...

	More applause.  This is very very very very fun.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Stillwater.

	Lights come up.  A full blast of audience love hits them right
	in the face, as they begin "Fever Dog."  The band charges
	headlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out
	of the crowd and onto the stage.

	HANDHELD ON RUSSELL

	Who is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his
	guitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back
	into the crowd.  He slips back under the strap, laughing.
	More stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and
	Russell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over
	to Russell to lean on him.  Russell turns to share the moment
	with Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the
	stage.

	112   INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT					112

	William in the dressing room, eyes red with exhaustion, finally
	interviewing Russell.  He holds the mike stoically.

					WILLIAM
			So when you play a great show like
			tonight...

	Dick enters with great urgency.

					DICK
			Okay.  I need everybody's attention.

	The kid shuts his eyes.  He knew this would happen.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Alright, well, the rumors are true.
			The record company has sent a big-time
			manager here to try and talk you into
			replacing me.  His name is Dennis Hope.
			I know you've all heard of him.  He's
			got all the big bands.  He's right
			outside.  He wants five minutes with
			you right now.  I think we gotta do
			it.

					RUSSELL
				(pissed)
			Then bring him in.

	William shuts off his tape recorder.

					JEFF
				(arrogant)
			Bring him in!  We'll send him out on a
			rail!

					RUSSELL
				(to William)
			We'll finish on the way to Boston.
			You can fly home from Boston.

	William nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door.  In walks a
	small general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed
	beard and bowl cut.  He holds the super-new Halliburton
	briefcase.  He is DENNIS HOPE, 25.  A man from the midwest,
	with a vision of the future of rock and roll.  Already in his
	head are all the things that will come to pass.  Higher ticket
	prices.  Merchandising deals.  Greater distribution and
	accounting of album sales.  He shrugs hello to the band.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(completely unthreatening)
			Hi.

					RUSSELL
			We already have a manager.  He's been
			with us from the beginning.

	Hope appreciates the lack of small talk.  He strides the room
	with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort.
	Russell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.

					DENNIS HOPE
			Respectfully.  We all have our roots.
			I believe in bands holding onto their
			roots.  But those roots need to be
			augmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth
			- I may enrage some and enthrall others.
			I don't really give a fuck.   Your
			manager here needs a manager.  Example.
			If you hadn't run out on the contract in
			Phoenix, you could have sued over
			Russell's hand... but you left, negating
			the contract, forfeiting the deposit,
			and you effectively traveled a long
			way to pay that promoter... to
			electrocute you.

	Russell looks at his hand.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			We can all work together.  Your damages
			have put you way into the hole for
			this tour.  Right now you owe the record
			company more than you've got.  But
			your record's selling, there's money
			to be made.  So I've brought a plane
			in, we can add more shows to make-up
			the difference.   Respectfully.

					RUSSELL
				(immediately)
			We travel by bus.

					JEFF
			Doris is the soul of this band!  That
			bus has been our home since we were
			the Jeff Bebe Band.

	Dick watches his loyal band with admiration.

					DENNIS
			Hey man -- it's travel on a pogo stick
			if I thought we'd make more money.
			You can play more dates with a plane...

	112A  INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT - SAME TIME				112A

	Penny Lane stands on stage facing the empty arena.  The roadies
	have packed up and moved on. She is alone in the poetic and
	trash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with
	people.  (Behavior to come)

							 INTERCUT WITH:

	112B  INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT					112B

	The band meeting continues.

					RUSSELL
				(passionate)
			Hey man, it's not about the money!  It's
			about Playing music, and turning people
			on!

	The band agrees.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(delicately)
			Yes, of course.  Clearly.
			Respectfully.   But on the distasteful
			subject of money.  Just know.  You're
			making it -- right now -- and it's all --

	He gestures to infinity.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			-- out there.  I'm just talking about
			bringing it --

	Bringing his hand together in a fist, he returns it, close to
	his heart.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			-- back here.

	The band looks at Dick, who manages not to be speechless.

					DICK
			But why should we pay you for something
			we can do ourselves?

					DENNIS HOPE
				(immediately)
			Do you know how to keep from getting
			charged for the ice below the
			floorboards of Chicago Stadium?
			Do you know how to do a headlining
			tour, do you Claire Rothman at the
			L.A. Forum?  Do you know Bobbi Cowan,
			Lisa Robinson, Jim Ladd, Frank
			Barcelona?
				(look around, amazed)
			This is Cleveland. Where's Kid Leo??
				(basics)
			Do you know how you get a record not
			pressed but played?  Do you know?  I
			didn't invent the rainy day, man.  I
			just own the best umbrella.

	He laughs.  It's fun.  Band members are now listening, curiously
	spellbound.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			Because as much as you may believe that
			it will last forever, it does not last
			forever... your biggest fan right now
			soon they're going to go to college,
			gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money
			some other way, and you know what?
				(the final insult)
			They'll tape your record from a friend's
			copy.

	Russell stops fingering his guitar.  Shot moves across the
	faces of the band members.  Pain.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			You've got to take what you can, when you
			can, while you can.  And you've got to do
			it now.  That's what the big boys do.

	The band squirms, but listens.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			Because if you think Mick Jagger will
			still be out there trying to be a rock
			star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly
			mistaken.

	Now he's reaching them.  Their slackened roar-weary faces stare
	back at the young dynamo.

					DICK
				(flustered)
			Yeah, well... we'll think about what
			you said.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(casually)
			No no.  You don't understand.  I'll
			think about it.  I'm not auditioning.
			I came here to decide whether I want
			to represent you.  So I'll stand outside
			for a moment, and think about whether
			I want to stay.

	He leaves the room with a pleasant shrug.  Stunned silence.
	William watches their body language.  No one wants to talk
	first.  Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can
	we talk him into staying?

	113   INT. PLANE -- DAY							113

	William watches as the band stands inside the new plane.  Dennis
	Hope looks on.

					RUSSELL
			This is not us.   This is too much.

	He looks around for support.  Grim nodding faces.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
				(impressed at seat)
			This is too much.

	William watches as Russell reclines.  Russell grabs Penny, and
	she falls into the seat next to him.   We hear the loud oncoming
	sound of the plane in flight, as Dennis cooly asks for Penny's
	seat.

					DENNIS HOPE
			Do you mind?

	114   EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY					114

	Doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near
	a field.  The new plane lifts off in the background, as the
	bus sits alone, as if crying steel tears.  Bus Banner reads
	simply: CLEVELAND.  Reprise ending of Whole Lotta Love.

	115   INT. PLANE  NIGHT							115

	The girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane,
	with William.

	116   INT. BOSTON HOTEL ROOM HALLWAY -- DAY				116

	William trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook,
	trolling for Russell.   He passes Boston travelogue posters on
	the walls.  A few room doors are open, he looks for any sign
	of the guitarist.   William veers into Dick's room, where a
	poker game full of Roadies is in progress.  The room is thick
	with exotic smoke.   They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs,
	smoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening
	not to rock and roll... but Sarah Vaughn.

					WILLIAM
			Anyone seen Russell?

					DICK
			The Enemy!

	Door widens to reveal Russell.

					RUSSELL
			Hey!  Welcome to the Road Crew Poker
			Party.  This game's been going of for
			two years.

					DICK
			That's Mick - he's with The Who.  That's
			John - with J. Geils.  And that's
			Richard with the Eagles... and you know
			The Wheel.

					THE WHEEL
			Hey.

	Grumbling roadies continue playing.  Like an old pro, the kid
	turns down a Cola-can hash-pipe.  This hand is down to Dick,
	and a roadie named REG from Humble Pie.

					DICK
			Side proposition.  For fifty dollars
			and a case of Heineken, I will put
			into the pot... three Lovely Ladies,
			Including the famous Penny Lane... the
			Band-Aids, who need to exit our tour
			before New York...

					REG
			It's a deal.  Show 'em.

	Dick lays down three tens.  Reg lays down three Kings.  Dick
	loses.

					DICK
			Three Lovely Ladies... now in the
			custody of Humble Pie.

					REG
			Alright, so we owe you fifty dollars
			and a case of Heineken.

	Embarrassed, Russell notices the kids face.  He leans over,
	and speaks confidentially to him.

					RUSSELL
			Look.  Nobody's feelings are getting
			hurt here.  She already knows Leslie's
			coming To New York tomorrow.  They all
			understand.  This is the Circus.
			Everybody's trying not to go home.
			Nobody's saying goodbye.

					WILLIAM
			No, I got it.

					RUSSELL
			These are the Rules that come with
			every electric Guitar and every
			amplifier.  They're not just written
			anywhere.  Rock and roll, brother.  No
			attachments.  No boundaries.

	But the kid feels bad, and Russell knows it.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Quit looking at me like that.

	116A  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON						116A

	The kid is still stuck on the road.  He is in hell now.
	Wearily, with deep circles under his eyes, he shuts his eyes
	for a moment.  Another band is moving through.

					SABBATH ROADIE
			Keep this hallway clear!

	117   INT. BACKSTAGE TRAILER/DRESSING ROOM -- AFTERNOON			117

	William and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room
	bench.  It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies,
	guitars and men in stages of half-dress.  Piles of luggage
	headed for New York sit by the door.  The door suddenly opens
	and Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a
	sparkler.  It is placed in Penny's lap. It reads: Unforgettable
	Penny... Age Unknown.  Boston, 1973.   They gather now as the
	cake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane.

					DICK
			Happy Birthday from us.

	William watches her face as she reads the message on the cake.
	It hasn't sunk in yet.

	Russell produces a piece of hotel stationery.  He reads a poem.

					RUSSELL
			So Penny our friend has gained another year.
			But long ago, she threw it in gear.
			She rocked the south
			The East and West.
			Could you please get off this endless tour
			Where we're Black Sabbath's fucking
			 special guest?

	Laughter.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			She says she's retired
			Though we've heard that before.
			She chose us...
			And in Penny Lane we trust
			She is a fan of this band.
			Much more so than us.

	William watches her face.  Still enchanted, she hands out slices
	of the cake.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(to the point)
			Sorry the plane isn't bigger.

	It hits her.  She looks at William for a clue.  His truthful
	face does not look away.  Now she knows.  She turns to the
	others -- the plane isn't bigger?  Shot moves in on Penny as
	she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging
	for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy
	laughter.  Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to
	connect with band members.  Each of them look away, nobody
	maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't
	look at.  William.  She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn
	Monroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers.
	Russell watches, as we push in on Penny.  She notices all the
	luggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.

	118   EXT. CONCORD PAVILLION BACKSTAGE -- EARLY MORNING			118

	William exits a backstage Portosan.  Penny catches him by the
	grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event.
	Their laminated passes swing from around their necks.  Thuding
	in the distance, Stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd.
	The sound of summer insects in the air.

					PENNY
			So it wasn't a birthday party, it was
			a farewell.

	William doesn't answer.  He looks at her, blowing some hair
	out of her face.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			You think you can fool me.  I read
			you.  I know what you're thinking.

					WILLIAM
			What's that?

					PENNY
				(touched)
			You're worried about me and Russell.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.  I gotta work on that.

					PENNY
			You're so sweet.  God -- if there was
			more of you in him...

					WILLIAM
			Don't tell me this stuff.  I want to
			like him.

					PENNY
				(concerned for him)
			Did you miss your test or something?

	He shakes his head.  It's so beyond a test.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			I know I'm not on the plane, and I'm
			not going on some other band's bus.  I
			mean, I could go with the Sabbath road
			crew, but that would be pathetic.  The
			girls are all going with Humble Pie.
			If you could find out from Russell --

					WILLIAM
				(quietly)
			Penny -

					PENNY
				(a decision)
			Forget it.  I'm flying to New York
			myself.  I have a bunch of partial
			tickets.  I know his ex-wife, current
			girlfriend's going to be there -

	William's eyebrows rise.  She examines his face for clues.

					WILLIAM
			-- I'm not sure that's a good idea.

					PENNY
				(overlapping)
			What?  What are you saying?  What do
			you know?  Did Russell say something?

					WILLIAM
			I don't know anything.

					PENNY
			I know he wants me there.  He gave me
			a cake.  He wrote me that sweet poem.

					WILLIAM
				(loud)
			Wake up!  Don't go to New York!

					PENNY
			What are you telling me?

	She looks so achingly beautiful to him.

					WILLIAM
			Because you're not who you said you
			were!  I thought you were retired!

					PENNY
			You're right.  I'm not who I said I
			was.  I'm just like you. I love music,
			so this is my family.  Some people
			like tractors, and they hang out with
			tractor people.  What's the worst that
			could happen if I go to New York?
				(little girl)
			"I get my little heart broken?"

					WILLIAM
			Oh no.  Never you!  You eat people
			alive!

	She tears some leaves off a tree.  He looks at her, unable to
	formulate a response.

					PENNY
				(accusatory)
			I'm sorry I told you so much.   You
			have some way of making everybody tell
			you all their secrets.

					WILLIAM
			That's a good one.  Tell me too much
			and make it my fault.

	He continues walking, she follows.  They have ventured outside
	the backstage area, onto adjoining Boston farmland.  The show
	booms in the background.

					PENNY
			Come on.  You've seen what's happened.
			Russell and I fell in love.  How much,
			I don't know... but this is the first
			time I've fallen for someone, really
			fallen... since Iggy, and I'm not happy
			about it.

					WILLIAM
				(beat)
			You slept with Iggy Pop!?

	She says nothing.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
				(sputtering)
			Why don't you just tell me now, who
			else -- so when I go to the record
			store, I know who to be jealous of.
			Because right now, it's looking like
			the whole store!

	He's upset.   She stares at him.

					PENNY
				(teasing, defiant)
			You'll remember me forever.  I was
			there when you lost your virginity.

					WILLIAM
				(upset at the memory)
			So was Steely Dan!  It was a crowded
			room.

	She laughs, can't help it.  Then:

					PENNY
			You make me laugh.  I think I'm gonna
			cry.

					WILLIAM
				(continuing)
			I thought we were going to Morocco!
			There's no Morocco.  There's never been
			a Morocco.  There's not even a Penny
			Lane.  I don'teven know your real
			name.

					PENNY
			If I ever met a guy in the real world,
			who looked at me the way you just looked
			at me...

					WILLIAM
			When and where does the real world
			occur?  I am really... confused here.
			Fuck!  All these Rules And all these
			sayings... and nicknames...

					PENNY
			You know -- you're too sweet for rock
			and roll.

					WILLIAM
			Where do you get off... where do you
			get "sweet?"  I'm not sweet.  I'm dark
			and mysterious and pissed-off and I
			could be very dangerous to all of you...
			I'm not sweet, and you should know
			that about me!  I am The Enemy.

					PENNY
			You're not any of those things and
			that's what I love about you.

	William stands there in disbelief, unable to look at her.

					WILLIAM
			You fall in love to keep from falling
			in love.

					PENNY
			I don't want to go home!

					WILLIAM
			Well, I have to go home.  And you never
			helped me.

					PENNY
			Yes I did.

					WILLIAM
			That disc-jockey in Arizona got a better
			interview than me... and he was asleep.

	He starts walking back to the stage.  She follows.  They are
	two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll.
	His frustration increases.  She just doesn't get it.  Applause
	in b.g.  She grabs his shirt.

					PENNY
			Look.  You should be happy for me.
			You don't know what he says to me in
			private.  Maybe it is love.  As much
			as it can be with someone who --

					WILLIAM
				(blurts)
			-- sold you to Humble Pie for fifty
			dollars and a case of beer?  I was
			there!

	He is instantly sorry.  Her world privately crumbles, but she
	tries to remain stoic and carefree.

					PENNY
			What kind of beer?

	119   INT. HUMBLE PIE CREW TRUCK -- DAY					119

	Sapphire, Polexia, and Estrella bump along to the music and
	the road.  They strain to maintain dignity in these decidedly
	third-class surroundings.  There's only one small blurry window.

					POLEXIA
			Who did this to us?

	120   INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT				120

	Mom on the phone.

					ELAINE
			Then don't come home.  Don't do this
			to me.  If you're going to miss
			graduation, don't come home.

	She hangs up.

	121   INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- NIGHT					121

	William on the phone.   Speechless.

	122   INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM -- DAY					122

	Elaine faces her Humanities class.  She stands in an
	amphitheater-style, inner-city college classroom, decorated
	with colorful unorthodox artifacts from her home.  These earnest
	city college students listen to her.  But she cannot continue.
	There is a thundering upset inside her.

					ELAINE
			I'm sorry.  I can't concentrate.
				(beat, confesses, unhinged)
			Rock stars kidnaped my son.

	123   INT. BAND PLANE -- DAY						123

	Music.  Russell and band bounces down in NYC.  Russell listens
	to music on headphones plugged into large boom box.

	124   INT. LIMOUSINE -- DAY						124

	William watches, facing the band from the jump seat of their
	limousine, heading into New York.  Up ahead, Manhattan looms,
	beautiful and scary.

					RUSSELL
			"New York.  Just like I pictured it...
			"

					JEFF
			" ... skyscrapers and everything."

					RUSSELL
				(to William)
			We showed you America.  We did
			everything but get you laid.

	Beat.  They look at each other curiously.  How much does the
	other guy know?

	125   EXT. ST. REGIS -- DAY						125

	Russell and band spill out of limo.  The New York cluster of
	hardcore Stillwater fans wait outside.  They hold collector's
	sleeves covering albums to be autographed, and fresh magic
	markers in hand.  William in tow crawls out of the limo last.
	Dick goes to work, pulling luggage from the trunk.  A serious-
	looking Fan (LENNY) approaches Russell with an autograph card.

					FAN
			I'm from the Church of Lenny.   We bow
			to his will and all that it represents
			- The King of the King of Kings.

					RUSSELL
			Make it out to - ?

					FAN
			To Lenny.

	Russell nods -- of course.  He signs, as Dick approaches with
	a well-placed word in his right ear.

					DICK
			She's here.

	William turns, expecting to see Penny.  Instead we see the
	long-limbed, athletic, pretty and collegiate LESLIE.    She
	holds a Nikon camera, and snaps their picture.

					JEFF
			Leslie!

					DICK
			Your room is completely stocked, far
			away from any noisy ice machines,
			elevators or maid quarters.  The air-
			conditioning is already on.  And here
			is your security key -- by the way,
			you look stunning.

					LESLIE
				(taking treatment for
			granted)
			ThanksI'llseeyoulater.

	Nearby, the young journalist studies the tour's subtle shift
	in welcoming Leslie.   Dick's New York side is almost military.

					DICK
			Bags in five!  Cars leave for the party
			at six!

	William studies Leslie, everyone saying hello to her, everyone
	knowing the subtext.  Nobody saying a word.  William pulls his
	heavy bag out of the back of the limousine.
	The bag breaks, and the contents spill out onto the New York
	sidewalk.  Bars of soap, ashtrays, hotel keys, crumpled paper,
	the contraband t-shirt, "Do Not Disturb" signs, notes, towels
	and thick telephone books from every city.

					DICK (cont'd)
			You know.  There are lighter souvenirs.

					WILLIAM
				(embarrassed)
			Well -- I kept thinking I was going
			home the next day --

					DICK
			I did too.  Fifteen years ago.

	All help him with his spilled souvenirs.  Russell shares a
	private look with the kid.  Nearby Leslie greets other band
	members.

					WILLIAM
			Ric!

	It's Super Zeppelin fan Ric Nunez.

					RIC
				(whispers)
			It's all happening.  Zeppelin is at
			the Plaza.  So's four other bands.
			They're partying up there right now.
			Sapphire, and Miss Penny Lane too...
			She wants you to call her.
				(William reacts)
			They're all staying under the name
			Emily Rugburn.

	William takes in the information, while regarding Ric's new
	custom  shirt, which features the words to Zeppelin's "The Rain
	Song."

					RUSSELL
				(exiting with Leslie)
			After the party.  I'll come to your
			room - I promise.  We'll talk.  This
			is Leslie, by the way.  Leslie, this
			is our wayward friend from Rolling
			Stone.  The Enemy.

	They shake, she smiles randomly.

	126   INT. ST. REGIS FRONT DESK -- NIGHT				126

	William checks in.

					CLERK
			William Miller?  Sir, you have an urgent
			call from a Mr. "Ben Fong-Torres."
			He's holding for you, right now.

	William takes the phone.  The Clerk watches curiously as the
	kid adopts a new persona.

					WILLIAM
				(deep voice)
			Hello.

									INTERCUT

	INT. JANN'S OFFICE -- SAN FRANCISCO -- AFTERNOON

	On a rainy day in San Francisco, Ben Fong-Torres stands in the
	copy-strewn office of the young editor/publisher JANN WENNER.
	Several other editors are also present in the background,
	including David Felton with cigarette-holder in mouth, and a
	prep-school Fact-Checker named ALLISON.

					BEN
			Congratulations.  It's gonna be a cover.
			Neal Preston will shoot 'em next week
			in L.A.  we need you back in San
			Francisco tomorrow.  We'll finish the
			story here.

	William is overwhelmed with many emotions, fear topping the
	list.

					BEN (cont'd)
			You can tell the band.  Allison, our
			fact checker, needs you to transmit
			whatever you have of the story, tonight,
			now, along with your notes.  There is
			a mojo at the Daily News they'll let
			us use -

					WILLIAM
			Mojo?

					BEN
			A mojo.  It's a very modern machine
			that transmits pages over the telephone.
			It only takes eighteen Minutes a page...

	126A  EXT. NEW YORK STREETS -- NIGHT					126A

	The sound of feet on pavement.  William looks at addresses,
	hustling to the Daily News office.

	126B  INT. DAILY NEWS COPY STATION -- NIGHT				126B

	William tears pages from his notebook and feeds them into the
	large and clunky earliest model fax machine -- "The Mojo."  We
	hear David Bowie.  "The Jean Genie."

	A127  EXT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT					A127

	William weaves, exhausted, into the Stillwater press party at
	this legendary New York nightspot.  The Doorman, who checks
	i.d.s, sees the kid and expresses great doubt.

					DENNIS HOPE
			He's okay, he's with us -

	Hope shoves him past the Guard, and sends him into a very mature
	new world.

	127   INT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT					127

	The famous hub of New York rock and roll.  A strong whiff of
	decadence mixes with youthful naivete.  Not a hippie in sight.
	William walks through, looking for familiar faces.  Overhead
	we hear Stillwater.  "If You Say Nothing."  The party is filled
	with scenesters, long silver-haired glamsters, some British
	journalists, and many hunched young skinny bodies in leather
	jackets.  Russell grabs him by the arm.

					RUSSELL
			Ah ha!  There you are, ya little fucker.
			Come on --

					WILLIAM
			I have some good news.

					RUSSELL
			-- I'll piss to that.  Follow me.

	A128  INT. MAX'S BEDROOM						A128

	They enter the small bathroom.  Russell bolts the door, faces
	the urinal and pees.  His own music throbs in the next room.

					RUSSELL
			Dennis Hope took me aside, and wants
			to manage Me solo.  Says to lose the
			band by February.  Should I do it?  I
			have no perspective anymore.

	William pees in silence.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			At what point do I just take the hint?
			Nobody Loves this band.  People like
			us, do they love us?

					WILLIAM
			I do.

					RUSSELL
				(then pissed)
			Oh - get this - somebody told Penny
			Lane I sold her for beer.  The network
			of these chicks!  Like I would do that.
			It's Jeff who told her, right?  Not
			you, right?  None of these guys can
			just calm down and be a fuckin adult.
			Now she's here, freaking out.  Leslie
			can smell it.

					WILLIAM
				(exiting)
			Wait.  I've got something to tell -

	But he finds himself trailing Russell to the back room bar.

	128   INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT - SAME TIME				128

	Leslie in the bathroom.  Penny enters and watches her
	discreetly.  They stand together, side-by-side at the mirror.
	Leslie looks once, turns and then turns back at Penny.  She
	knows.

	129   INT. BACKROOM -- NIGHT						129

	William sits with the band.  Over Jeff's head, Penny hangs
	nearby, at the outskirts, drinking and dancing.  They share a
	look, feigning casualty.

					WILLIAM
			You guys -- you guys --
				(beat)
			You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling
			Stone.

	Stunned and overwhelmed, the band waits a beat, lets it sink
	in... and goes wild.  Russell, stunned too, looks at the kid.
	It's big news.  Jeff stands immediately, eyes moist, glass
	raised.

					JEFF
				(tears welling, instantly)
			The cover of Rolling Stone.  And we
			made it together.  They don't just put
			somebody with one little hit on the
			cover of Rolling Stone Fucking Magazine,
			man.  We made it.

	The band nods solemnly, importantly.

					JEFF (cont'd)
				(continuing)
			Damn it -- I'm gonna enjoy this.  The
			first time I bought that magazine The
			Beatles were on the cover.  Four of
			them.  Four of us.  Together.
			TOGETHER!

	They begin singing the then-current Dr. Hook and the Medicine
	Show hit, "The Cover of the Rolling Stone" to William.

					LESLIE
			Who is that girl?  She's creeping me
			out.  She's not with any of you, is
			she?

					WILLIAM/DICK
			She's with me.

	And now Leslie has confirmation.  A symphony of looks, as Dick
	gets to his feet and moves to confront Penny.  Penny Lane's
	eyes fill and she runs out.  Russell stands... and sees William
	also stand.  William turns and follows her.  Russell stands
	watching, and does not leave.   We hear Elton John's  "Mona
	Lisas and Mad Hatters."

	130   EXT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT					130

	William exits as a crush of Partygoers arrives.  He doesn't
	know where she is.   He takes off to examine the cabs stuck in
	traffic.  Song continues.

	POV WILLIAM

	He looks in the backs of cabs.   None of them her.

	Music continues.  He runs down the streets, looking for her.
	Alone in New York City.

	131   INT. PLAZA HOTEL -- NIGHT						131

	William on the house phone.

					WILLIAM
			Emily Rugburn, please.

	132   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY -- NIGHT					132

	William approaches Suite 702.  The door is open.  He hears new
	band voices, and sees new faces. MUSICIAN  # 1 intercepts him.

					WILLIAM
			Hi.  I'm a friend of Penny Lane's.

					MUSICIAN # 1
			Aren't we all -

	Musician types are leaving.

					WILLIAM
			Where is she?

	Room Service arrives.  Some appetizers and a large expensive
	bottle of champagne on ice.

					ROOM SERVICE GUY
			Can somebody sign for this?

	William does.

					ROOM SERVICE GUY (cont'd)
			Thank you Mr. Rugburn.

	Two more Musicans (English) exit the back room party.  The
	room is clearing out.

					ENGLISH MUSICIAN
			She's sick.  Let's get out of here.

					ENGLISH MUSICIAN # 2
			She used to be so much more together.

	William watches all, champagne in hand, and finds her in the
	backroom.  She's addled and nearly passed out.

					WILLIAM
			What happened?

					PENNY LANE
			I'm not good at goodbyes.

	She sags.  He grabs the phone.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			You're the last of my old-time friends.
			Polexia went to England with Deep
			Purple... can you believe that?  Even
			Sapphire's out someplace else.  All
			she left was her quaaludes.

					WILLIAM
			Oh -- wonderful.
				(into phone)
			Front desk?  Please send a doctor.
			Room... what room?  703.  702.   Both
			rooms, either room.  This is Mr. Rugburn,
			Yes.  My wife's had an accident with
			some quaaludes.  Yes - I'll do that.

	The room has emptied out.  Just them, and the remnants of a
	movable party that has moved elsewhere.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			Wake up!

	He struggles to get her on her feet.  She tips over on her
	strappy platform shoes.  He struggles to untie them.

	133   EXT. GRADUATION -- DAY						133

	The School band plays "Colour My World."  School PRINCIPAL at
	the podium.

					PRINCIPAL
			And now... out graduating class!  Jane
			Abbott!

	A peppy student bounds up and grabs her diploma.   Elaine Miller
	watches dolefully in the audience.

	134   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						134

	William holds Penny in his arms.  Finally she is close to him.

	135   EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY -- DAY					135

					PRINCIPAL
			Victor Sanchez!

	Warm applause for another student who grabs his diploma.  He
	takes off his mortar board to flash an American flag bandana.
	He raises his diploma in victory.

	136   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						136

	William holds Penny Lane, and keeps her moving.  It's a sagging,
	messy slow dance.

					WILLIAM
			"In the unlikely event of a water
			landing... "

					PENNY
			"... you will be required to wear a
			safety vest."

					WILLIAM
			Keep going.

					PENNY
			"Please place all stowable luggage in
			the overhead compartments... out in the
			seat in front of you."

					WILLIAM
				(prompting)
			"Seat and tray tables."

					PENNY
			"And seat-backs and tray-tables should
			be in their full and upright and locked
			positions... "

	137   EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY -- DAY					137

					PRINCIPAL
			And now... out "Pending" Graduates!
				(pause)
			William Miller... not present.

	Elaine applauds her son, stoically.  It is a dagger through
	her heart.  A sympathetic look from a nearby Mother continues
	the pain.

	138   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT						138

	They move slowly, she's fading.

					WILLIAM
			"In the tragic event of a water
			landing..."

	139   EXT. GRADUATION - DAY						139

	The Principal shares a few thoughts:

					PRINCIPAL
			And to the class of 1973, we say --
				(beat)
			Don't forget to remember yourself as
			you are today...  Full of hope... and
			the dream that everything is possible...
			Remember this, twenty years from now,
			when we all own home computers and we
			all travel in shiny electrical cars
			that move swiftly, high above the
			city...
				(beat)
			They key to the future is keeping today
			alive forever.

	Elaine's head lowers slowly in a sea of happy parents.  The
	day will never end.  Mrs. Deegan slips into the seat next to
	her.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			First.  Release the guilt.
				(Elaine nods)
			Second -

					ELAINE
			Please let there be only two, because
			I can't get past Number One.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Second.  Leave a little room for the
			other teachers in this world.  He's
			out there looking for mentors.

					ELAINE
			He's got twelve of them.  They're lined
			up.  He's just tired of me.

	A140  INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						A140

	William holds Penny.  She is very woozy.

					PENNY
			"... you will be required to..."
				(gives up)
			I'm tired.

	She is very groggy, as he holds her.

					WILLIAM
			Well.  Now that I have your attention.
			And you may not remember this later, I
			just want to make it clear that... Hey!
				(she blinks, barely awake
			again)
			I know you've heard this before.  And
			I have never said this to anybody, not
			really - well, nobody who didn't legally
			have to say it back to me, but -
				(tries to be casual)
			I love you.  And I have a hard time
			sharing you with all of rock and roll
			because I - why am I nervous? - You'll
			never remember this - HEY! -
				(she blinks)
			I love you, and I'm about to boldly go
			where...  Many men have gone before...

	He kisses her.  A doctor and nurse come crashing into the room.
	They push past William and pull Penny into the bathroom.  He
	sits on the edge of the bed, looking into the bathroom, as
	they work on her.  We hear Stevie Wonder.  "My Cherie Amor."

	140   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT							140

	Doctor places a tube down Penny Lane's throat.  A bored nurse
	holds a water-bag, lowering it to ground level.

	WILLIAM'S POV INTO BATHROOM

	Her feet sticking out, wriggling.  He watches, as music
	continues.

	ON THE BATHTUB

	Her amber-colored stomach contents look like a Jackson Pollack
	portrait of the era, with three partially dissolved pills.
	Doctor hands enter frame and remove them.  Music continues.

	141   INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT					141

	The Doctor re-appears, and sits down next to William, as the
	Nurse exits.  The Doctor withdraws a three-page report form.

					DOCTOR
			Your wife will be okay for now -

					WILLIAM
			Thank you Doctor.

					DOCTOR
			However, she says you're her brother.

					WILLIAM
				(eyes report)
			She's a little confused.

	The ice shifts in the champagne bucket nearby.  The Doctor
	sizes up the situation.

					DOCTOR
			Nice champagne.

					WILLIAM
			I don't have a driver's license.  With
			me.

					DOCTOR
			Tomorrow's my wedding anniversary.
			I'd prefer to take care of this without
			facing the dawn at the police station.
			So if you can find a way to get this
			girl - your wife - back home to her
			parents, I'd let you pay me anything
			you can afford.  Because you don't
			appear to be related to the famous
			Rugburns of Rhode Island.

	His eyes flick to the champagne.  The kid takes a hint, reaches
	over to the champagne.

					WILLIAM
			Happy Anniversary.

	The Doctor puts the champagne in his bag.

					DOCTOR
			She won't be good company, but keep
			her awake for another four hours.

	142   INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER -- MORNING				142

	Song continues.  William and Penny drag themselves through the
	airport.  He guides her to the ticket counter.  Penny wears
	her green coat, large sunglasses.  He sorts through her many
	partial tickets.  They are both so tired.  She shakes off her
	coat -- she's suddenly very hot -- and he grabs it and loops
	it through her bags.  She's irritable, and ready to go home.

	143   INT. AIRPORT GATE - MORNING					143

					PENNY
				(baring her soul)
			When I was 14, my Mom and her boyfriend
			took me to a Rolling Stones concert -
			and I freaked out and I rushed up to
			the front of the stage and then a
			thousand people had the same idea at
			the same time and I was getting crushed.
			And I couldn't breathe and that thought
			flashed through me - almost like a car
			accident - I thought I might die.  And
			it was in the middle of "Midnight
			Rambler" and Keith Richards saw me.
			And he came over, and came to the front
			of the stage, and he pulled me out.
			And they took me backstage and they
			gave me coke with ice and a - and a
			lemon.  And I never went home.

					WILLIAM
			What about your Mom?

					PENNY
			She always said - "Marry Up." Marry
			someone grand.  That's why she named
			me Lady.

					WILLIAM
				(horrified)
			She named you Lady?

					PENNY
			Lady Goodman.

					WILLIAM
			No.

					PENNY
			You never really get used to it, either.

					WILLIAM
			Well -- this -- this just explains
			everything.

	He wishes it did.  She rubs her stomach.  It's a rocky morning.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			See you back in the real world.

					PENNY
			See you back there.

	She kisses his forehead, and takes off down the accordian
	leading to her plane.  She drops her coat again, bending down
	to retrieve it.

					WILLIAM
			Hey Lady!

	Four Woman turn, but not Penny.  She disappears.

	144   INT. AIRPLANE - DAY						144

	Penny Lane settles into her seat on the airplane.  She notices
	William watching from the terminal window, and waves.

					STEWARDESS
			Please extinguish all flammable items,
			and return all seats and tray tables to
			their full and upright locked positions.

	She mouths along with the words.  There is no one to share the
	joke with.  And then a few blurry memories come back to her.
	She gestures to him... understanding him more fully... as he
	disappears.

	145   INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY					145

	William walks alongside her plane, moving from terminal window
	to terminal window.  Catching her glance again, he's picking
	up steam.  What's she saying?

	146   INT. PLANE - DAY							146

	She keeps watching as he runs alongside, still keeping up with
	her plane.  She now fully remembers, and places her outstretched
	fingers on the window.  She mouths the words:   I'll see you
	back home!

	ON WINDOW

	He us running through her fingers.

	CLOSE ON WILLIAM

	Who can run no further.

									FADE OUT

	FADE UP

	147   INT. BAND PLANE -- DAY						147

	Russell and William are in mid-interview.  The kid's microphone
	is out.  It's a little bit of a rough flight.  William wears
	the same clothes.

					RUSSELL
			Why didn't you come back to the party?
			Bob Dylan showed up.  He was sitting
			at our table for... had to be an hour,
			right?  Just  Rapping.  Bob Dylan!  I
			kept looking for you.  I was going to
			introduce you.

	The kid feels pain.

					JEFF
			What happened to you last night?

					WILLIAM
			It's a log story.

	A sharp jolt of turbulence.  Russell begins pounding on the
	card table in rhythm.

					RUSSELL
				(singing Buddy Holly)
			"Peggy Sure... Peggy Sue... "

					DICK
			Please.

					RUSSELL
			"Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy
			Sue... "

	A moment of laughter, and then bam.  Jeff's drink rises and
	suspends briefly in mid-air.  The plane takes another mighty
	knock.

					JEFF
			We shouldn't be here.

					RUSSELL
			Doris, we miss you!

	Fear is creeping in around the edges.  William, already an
	uneasy flier, looks down.

					PILOT'S VOICE
			This is Craig, your pilot.  It appears
			we've caught the edge of that electrical
			storm we were trying to outrun.  Buckle
			up tight now.  We're gonna do our best
			to getcha out of this.

	The rocking of the plane worsens, as all buckle up.

					JEFF
			"Electrical storm?"

					RUSSELL
				(strapping in for a roller
			coaster)
			Rock and roll.

	The sky darkens abruptly. William looks up, increasingly
	nervous, stares straight ahead.  The plane suddenly drops and
	stabilizes.  Everyone is silent but Russell.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Wooooooo Baby!

	A moment later, an ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges, balancing
	himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane.

					CO-PILOT
			We're gonna try to land in Tupelo.
			We're going to have to cut the inside
			lighting for the next several minutes.
			We found a field to land in.

	The kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix.

					DENNIS HOPE
			A field?

					JEFF
			I can't breathe.

	Push in on Russell. We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical
	sounds.  The plane screwballs through the sky.

					CO-PILOT
			It might be a rough set-down.  We should
			be fine.
				(cracking at the edges)
			But what we do say in a situation like
			this is - We would pass but before the
			plane ... disassembled.  However, God
			help us, if there's anything you want
			to say to each other, any secrets,
			anything like that, now would be a
			good time.  But just hang in there.
			We'll get you out of this.

	He returns to the cockpit.  The weather worsens, as the hail
	suddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard.  Inside lights
	shut off.   William stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door
	swings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts again.

					DICK
			And everyone thinks it's so glamorous
			out here.

					LARRY
				(oddly detached)
			He just told us we're gonna die.

					JEFF
				(insecurities running wild)
			We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --

					RUSSELL
			Shut up.

					JEFF
			-- we can't even die in an original
			city!

					RUSSELL
			C'mon Dennis, get us a better city.

	Nervous laughter.  Another sheet of hail hits the plane.

					LESLIE
			Oh my God.

	PUSH IN ON WILLIAM

	Just shaking.  Nearly in tears.   Hyperventilating.

					RUSSELL
			If something should happen.  I love
			all of you.  I don't think we have to
			do the secrets thing.

	The plane shakes.  Now lightening strikes very close.  A
	flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and
	evaporates with a burning smell still in the air.  In the
	darkness:

					DENNIS HOPE
			I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
			A hit-and-run.  I hit him and kept on
			going.  I don't know if he's alive or
			dead, but I'm sorry.

					LESLIE
				(gripped with fear)
			Oh my God.

	The plane wildly rises, and falls.  It stops for a moment.  A
	strange smooth patch.

					DICK
			I love you all too, and you're my
			family.  Especially since Marna left
			me.  But if I ever took an extra dollar
			or two, here and there, it was because
			I knew I'd earned it.

					RUSSELL
			I slept with Marna, Dick.

					JEFF
			I did too.

					LARRY
			I waited until you broke up with her.
			But me too.

					JEFF
			I also slept with Leslie, when you
			were fighting.

					RUSSELL
			You... slept with Jeff?

					LESLIE
			Yes, but it didn't count.  It was the
			summer we decided to be free of all
			rules.

					RUSSELL
				(to Jeff)
			And you say you "love me."

					JEFF
				(the truth)
			I don't love you, man.  I never did.

					RUSSELL
			Please.  Enough.

					JEFF
			NONE of us love you.  You act above
			us.  You ALWAYS HAVE!!

					LARRY
			Finally.  The truth.

					JEFF
			You just held it over us, like you
			light leave... like we're lucky to be
			with you. And we had to live with it.
			I had to live with you, and now I might
			die with you and it's not fucking fair.

	William watches, catatonic.

					RUSSELL
				(to Larry and Ed)
			You hate me?  You too?

	Larry stares at him.  Ed says nothing.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			All this love.  All this loyalty.
				(incredulous, giddy)
			And you don't even like me.

					JEFF
			And I'm still in love with you Leslie.

	Bam.  The plane is pulling sideways, and dropping altitude.

					LESLIE
			I don't want to hear anymore.    Shut
			up! Shut up!  Shut up!

					RUSSELL
				(to Jeff)
			Whatever happens, you're dead.

					JEFF
			Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not
			now.  You were sleeping with Penny,
			that groupie.  Last summer, and up
			until yesterday.  Why don't you tell
			Leslie THAT?

	Russell tries to get up and attack him.  The force keeps him
	in his seat.  He yells.  Loud.

					DENNIS
				(freaking out)
			I quit.

	The turbulence worsens.  William finds his mouth saying
	emotional words he cannot control.

					WILLIAM
			"That groupie?"  She was a Band-Aid.
			All she did was love your band.  And
			you all -- you used her, all of you.
			You used her and threw her away.  She
			almost died last night, while you were
			with Bob Dylan.  You're always talking
			about the fans, the fans, the fans.
			She was your biggest fan and you threw
			her away.  And if you can't see that,
			that's your biggest problem.

	Russell and Jeff stare at each other.   The plane is rocking
	very very hard.  Leslie is crying.

					ED
			I'm gay.

	They all turn to the silent drummer.  (It's his first spoken
	dialogue of the movie.)

	Then.

	The plane pops out from below the clouds.  Sunshine spikes
	through the embattled windows of the plane, as they float
	downwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi.  A very very
	uneasy silence fills the plane.  No one can look at each other.
	Out bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory.

					CO-PILOT
			Thank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!!   WE'RE
			ALIVE!!  WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT!!

	Shot of all the occupants, ending with Russell.  Suddenly, the
	alternative seems far more attractive.  We hear Rod Stewart's
	"Jo's Lament" as music plays over their still-shocked faces.

	148   INT. TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAY				148

	Music continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long
	and very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid.  Everything is
	different now.  The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster.
	We continue with the band, unhappily moving forward.  William
	hustles back to catch up.  They ignore him.  There are much
	bigger thoughts in play.  No one wants to speak.

					JEFF
			Well, I think we can build on this new
			honesty.

	Boom.  Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart.  The
	band continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport
	terminals.  William stops.  This is where he must part company.
	He stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band
	continues, unaware he's split off.   He watches their backs,
	they've forgotten him.

	Then Russell turns, sensing something missing.  William.  All
	now stop and turn.  Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre-
	occupied but heartfelt goodbye.  William waves.  Music
	continues.

	ON AIRPLANE DEPARTURE SCHEDULE

	William's finger finds San Francisco.

	149   INT. CAB -- SAN FRANCISCO -- DAY					149

	The kid checks the address as he arrives at the MJB Building,
	and its next-door neighbor, the San Francisco headquarters of
	Rolling Stone Magazine.  He still wears the same clothes from
	last night in New York.

	150   INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY				150

	William arrives at the front desk, gets the once-over from  a
	friendly RECEPTIONIST, a paragon of new cool.

					RECEPTIONIST
			Leave your package at the desk.

					WILLIAM
			I'm not a messenger.  I'm one of your
			writers.  William Miller.

	He is zombie-tired, with heavy duffel case and his orange bag.

	151   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY					151

	William walks down the center aisle.  Editors and writers look
	at him, standing at the front of their cubicles to see this
	exhausted 15 year-old writer.  At the end of the aisle, like a
	human finish line, stand Ben Fong-Torres.

					BEN
			You're William Miller?

	The secret emerges not with a bang but with a slight and tired
	nod of the head.

					WILLIAM
			Yep.

					BEN
				(putting it all together)
			Oh baby.

	Ben leads him into the office of Jann Wenner, the editor-
	publisher.

	152   INT. JANN WENNER'S OFFICE -- DAY					152

	William sits.  Editors are feverishly discussing the next issue.
	The big concerns of a national magazine are in the air.
	Everyone is focused and quick.  The conversation is machine-
	gun like. Jann Werner turns to the kid.

					JANN
			We can't run this piece.

	The kid's eyes travel to his story -- a stack of fuzzy-looking
	sheets on the table.

					BEN
			You obviously saw more than you wrote
			about.  After eight days on the road
			with these guys.

					DAVID FELTON
			Didn't anything happen?

					JANN
			And where are you in this piece?  What
			did you want to write?  Because this
			reads like what they wanted you to
			write.

					BEN
			What happened to your highly-touted
			think piece on limitations of a middle-
			level Band in the face of success?

	William sits speechless.  It's sinking in.  Failure.
	Conversation continues at a fast pace:

					JANN
			We can push up Chet's Who cover -

					FACT CHECKER
			Good 'cause it's going to take me three
			days to get through this research.
			It's all handwritten, on little slips.
			Plus, they all refer to woman as
			"chicks." I mean, as a woman I have a
			problem with that.  I know it's a side
			issue.

					DAVID FELTON
				(sympathetic, loquacious)
			It's a "puff piece."  you fell for
			'em.  It happens.  A relationship forms.
			You want them to like you.
				(wistful, chewing cigarette
			holder)
			Happened with me and Charlie Manson.
			He was a very charming... lively...
			charismatic...

	Felton catches himself swooning.  The other are staring at
	him.  He snaps out of it.

					DAVID FELTON (cont'd)
			... mass-murderer.

					WILLIAM
			Please let me finish it.  Give me
			tonight to work on it.

					FACT CHECKER
			Chet's piece is all fact-checked and
			ready.

					JANN
				(to William)
			Get some sleep.  We'll do another story
			sometime.  We'll get you a kill fee.

					FACT CHECKER
			His research is all on little bits of
			paper.  Did I say that?

					WILLIAM
			Ben.  You told me to send what I had.
			It's not finished.

					FACT CHECKER
			That's being charitable.

	Ben looks at the kid, then at Jann.  Jann scans the kid's face
	for a beat, nods.

					JANN
			Let him use the big office.   It's
			where Hunter used to write.

	William rises, gratefully.  He shakes Jann's hand.

					FACT CHECKER
				(pointed re: his age)
			You can type.

					WILLIAM
			Yes.  It took it in grade school.

	153   INT. BIG OFFICE -- NIGHT						153

	William sits in the "big" office.  It's a small white tank.
	After all the sound and fury, there is only the hum of a large
	electric typewriter.  His research, transcripts and some band
	photos sit nearby.  He takes a bite of a candy bar, a sip of
	coffee.  He looks at the phone.

	INT. LESTER BANGS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

	Crazy jazz is playing.  Lester Bangs on the phone.

					LESTER BANGS
			Aw, man.  You made friends with them!
			See, friendship is the booze they feed
			you.  They want you to get drunk on
			feeling like you belong.

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. ROLLING STONE -- NIGHT

	William in the empty Rolling Stone office.

					WILLIAM
				(ruefully)
			Well, it was fun.

					LESTER BANGS
			They make you feel cool.  And hey.  I
			met you.  You are not "cool."

					WILLIAM
			I know.  Even when I though I was, I
			knew I wasn't.

					LESTER BANGS
			That's because we are uncool!  And
			while women will always be a problem for
			guys like us, most of the great   art in
			the world is about that very problem.
			Good-looking people have no spine!
			Their art never lasts!  They  get the
			girls, but we're smarter.

					WILLIAM
			I can really see that now.

					LESTER BANGS
			Yeah, great art is about conflict and
			pain and guilt and longing and love
			disguised as sex, and sex disguised as
			love... and let's face it, you got a
			big head start.

					WILLIAM
			I'm glad you were home.

					LESTER BANGS
			I'm always home!  I'm uncool!

					WILLIAM
			Me too!

					LESTER BANGS
				(leveling)
			The only true currency in this bankrupt
			world if what we share with someone
			else when we're uncool.

					WILLIAM
				(distraught)
			I feel better

					LESTER
			My advice to you.  I know you think
			those guys are your friends.  You want
			to be a true friend to them?

	William takes a deep breath.  Looks at the research cassettes and
	notebooks.  The empty page.

					LESTER BANGS
			Be honest and unmerciful.
				(beat)
			You're doing great.  Call me later is
			you want.  I'm always up.

	154   INT. ROLLING STONE OUTER OFFICE -- MORNING			154

	Ben Fong-Torres and David Felton look at William's new
	manuscript with great interest.

					FELTON
			Read me the opening line.

					BEN
				(reads aloud)
			"I am flying high over Tupelo,
			Mississippi, with America's hottest
			band, and we are all about to die."

					FELTON
			Mmmmm.
				(as if sampling wine)
			Dark.  Lively.

					BEN
			Yeah, and it gets better.
				(impressed)
			Did this all really happen?

	William sleeps restlessly nearby, mouth agape, sitting upright
	in a plastic chair.

					FACT CHECKER
				(jealously reaches for
			manuscript)
			Give it to me.  I'll call and check
			the quotes.

	155   INT. NEW TOUR BUS -- DAY						 155

	The band rides in a new tour bus.  The palpable tone in the
	air is -- PANIC.

					JEFF
			Look.  Let's just piece together our
			information...  because the fact-checker
			asked us all about different parts of
			the story.

					TONY
			What did he write about?  What's he
			using?

					JEFF
			It.  All.  He's using it all.

					RUSSELL
			So what?

					JEFF
			So what?
				(beat)
			We come off like amateurs... some
			average band...  trying to come to
			grips, jealous and fighting and breaking
			up - we're buffoons!

					RUSSELL
			Maybe we just don't see ourselves the
			way we really are.

					JEFF
			He was supposed to be our friend.

					RUSSELL
				(ruefully, remembering)
			I told him to write what he wanted.

	All eyes look to Russell.

					TONY
				(to Russell)
			By the way, he has you on acid,
			screaming "I Am A Golden God" from a
			fan's rooftop.

					RUSSELL
				(immediately remembering)
			Oh my God.

					JEFF
			They used him to fuck us.

					RUSSELL
				(still back at "Golden
			God")
			I didn't say "Golden God."  Or did I?

					DICK
			We never took him seriously, and now
			it's serious.

					RUSSELL
			I liked him as a person.

					JEFF
			He was never a "person!"  He was a
			journalist!

	Russell nods.  He looks at Silent Ed, drumming soundlessly on
	a rubber pad.

					RUSSELL
			You.  You had the right idea all along.

	Ed silently nods thanks.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(nervously)
			How about the plane flight?

					DICK
			It's all in there.  But don't worry,
			it's all unspecific who say what.  No
			names are mentioned in the more
			embarrassing sequences, it's just
			completely obvious who's who!  We're
			fucked!

	Silence.

					RUSSELL
			I forgot he was there.

					DENNIS HOPE
			Well, they haven't talked to Russell -
			he can always deny the key stuff to
			the fact checker.  Then they can't
			print it.

					JEFF
				(brightening)
			Is that true?

					DENNIS HOPE
			It's war, my friend.  If you'd met me
			earlier, he would have never been on the
			around.

	Dennis hands Russell the phone.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			He'll live.

	156   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY					156

	William is still being congratulated by his new peers.  We see
	him woozy but beaming, as Allison the Fact Checker comes out
	of her office, waving the manuscript.  She works her way through
	the cluster of editors.

					FACT CHECKER
			The band just denied 90% of the story.
			It's a fabrication.

	Everyone looks at William, who is speechless and confused.
	Their congratulations stop on a dime.  The fact checker can't
	resist twisting the knife a little.

					FACT CHECKER (cont'd)
			You weren't honest.  And worse, you
			wasted our time.

					WILLIAM
			Did you talk to Russell?

					FACT CHECKER
			Russell Hammond is the one who denied
			it.

					BEN
				(darkly)
			Crazy.

					FACT CHECKER
				(one last shot, to William)
			We're going with the Who - !

	The kid has been sandbagged.  The machine of a big-time magazine
	whirs into action on another story, as the cluster moves down
	the hall.

					SOMEONE'S VOICE
			He's just some fan... what did you
			expect?

	William sits there, as only David Felton stay behind,
	brandishing his cigarette-holder.  He sits down next to the
	kid.

					FELTON
			Well, I believe you.

	He looks at the kid, decides to offer a personal parable.

					FELTON (cont'd)
			Jim Morrison once came to my house and
			drank a beer.  The beer is still on my
			mantle.  I'm 35 years old with Jim
			Morrison's beer as a shrine.  I wanted
			to be Earnest Hemingway.  Instead.  I
			have Jim Morrison's beer.
				(shrugs, he's learned to
			live with it)
			If you didn't make your story up, good
			for you.  If you did make it up... good
			for you.

	The kid looks at him, too tired and still in shock.

					FELTON (cont'd)
			Say something, so I know you're alive.

					WILLIAM
			Goodbye.

	He exits.

					FELTON
			Powerful  word.  Strong.  Final.

	157   INT. BACKSTAGE CREW MEAL - NIGHT					157

	Russell Hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper-plate
	filled with buffet-style food - steak and baked potato.
	Preoccupied, and several seats away from other crew members.
	He drinks a glass of milk.   Out old friend Sapphire takes the
	seat next to him, holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables.

					RUSSELL
			I feel bad.

					SAPPHIRE
			Well, at least you feel.  That puts
			you in a higher class of asshole.

	They eat in silence.  Sapphire looks around.  The new breed of
	groupies eye her, as they cruise Russell on the periphery.
	They're bolder, flashier.  She eyes them back with seniority.

					RUSSELL
			What did I do?

					SAPPHIRE
			Well - you can do what the big boys
			do.
				(he looks at her)
			Nothing.

					RUSSELL
			Yeah.

	The girls still circle Russell nearby.  He's unaware.

					SAPPHIRE
			You believe these new girls?  None of
			'em take birth control, and they eat
			all the steak.

	She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables.  An ever-sharp
	mind in last night's clothes, she commands Russell's respect.

					SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
			They don't even know what it id to be
			a fan!  To blindly love some silly
			piece of music... or some band so much
			that it hurts... please,  they're all
			just after the money.  Shoo --
				(in their direction)
			Go rob a bank!  It's more honest!

					RUSSELL
			Is Penny okay?

					SAPPHIRE
			The Quaalude Incident.  Yeah, it wasn't
			pretty.  She could have died.  I always
			warned her about letting too many guys
			fall in love with her.  I guess I was
			wrong.
				(shrugs)
			On of 'em saved her life.

	Russell nods.

					RUSSELL
			Well, it's finally over with Leslie.
			I'm going to call her.

					SAPPHIRE
			Let her retire.
				(he doesn't respond)
			You want to lock her up in a house in
			Michigan?  Please.
				(he doesn't respond)
			Write her a song someday.  She deserves
			it.  Something about that girl brought
			out the best in a lot of...
				(looks around backstage)
			... pretty average people.  She deserves
			it...

	Russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.

					SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
				(forward thinking)
			... because something tells me twenty
			years from now, we'll remember her...
			and not much else.

	Russell smiles to himself, knows it's true.  Dick passes,
	placing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little.

					DICK
			Have a good vacation.  I hope the band
			stays together.  Before it all went
			down the shitter, it was starting to
			get really good.

	Dick claps Russell on the back, and moves on.  He turns to
	Sapphire.

					RUSSELL
			I'm not going to blame myself.  I do
			make people happy.  They just shouldn't
			get to know me... 'cause it appears to
			spoil everything.

					SAPPHIRE
			Don't be so easy on yourself.

					RUSSELL
			What gives you the right to get this
			personal with me.

					SAPPHIRE
			Let's not reminisce.

	158   INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT -- NIGHT				158

	William moves like a zombie through the airport, and collapses
	in a seat.  He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic.
	A cluster of Flight Attendants pass.  One stops, a stylish young
	woman wearing a tall bubble-shaped PSA hat with swirling colors.

					ANITA
			William?

	He looks at her.  He feels like he's on Mars, and she looks
	like a Martian.

					ANITA (cont'd)
			You guys this is my brother!

					MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
				(ad if meeting a celebrity)
			"The Narc?!"

	William looks woefully at them, like a dog who's been hit by a
	car.

					ANITA
			You guys, I'll deadhead back later.  I
			think I'm needed.

					MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
			Nice to finally meet you.

					FEMALE ATTENDANT
			You have a good day!

	Anita looks in her brother's face.

					ANITA
			You look awful, but that's great.
			You're living your life!  You're finally
			free of... her.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					ANITA
			Hey.  I'll take off work.  Let's have
			an adventure together.  You and me,
			finally.  Anywhere you want to go.
			Anywhere in the world.

	159   EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- DAY					159

	William whistles the family whistle.  Sister and brother trudge
	up the steps.

					ANITA
			This is not my idea of a good time.

					WILLIAM
			Just get me to my bed.

					ANITA
				(resigned)
			I'll deal with her.

	William whistles again.  Mom meets them at the door.  She looks
	at her trashed son who has finally come home.  For the first
	time, she hugs Anita first, and it's not lost on Anita.

	It's a clumsy neck-hug, neither wanting to commit.  The kid
	passes to his Mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally
	nudging her into his sister.  Anita takes this as an aggressive
	act of love, and hugs her mother back.  Tears stream down Mom's
	face.  Their cheeks touch. Mom pulls away, and sees her own
	tears on Anita's face.  Thinking that she's also crying, she
	grabs a tissue for them both.

	160   INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS					160

	The kid stands in the hallway listening, shaking his head,
	poised to enter his room, unseen by them.

					ANITA
				(so worried)
			What are we going to do about him?

					ELAINE
			I don't know.  Whatever happened to him, I
			just wish it could have happened to me.

					ANITA
			The magazine killed his story.

	Now they really hug, Anita gulping back real tears.  William
	watches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure.
	William goes into the bedroom, the final three feet to sleep,
	and shuts the door.  A hand places a hotel sign on the door -
	DO NOT DISTURB.  Slight push in.

	ON BED

	He collapses with all his clothes on, almost instantly asleep.  His
	walls, just as he left them, boast a pantheon of rock heroes...
	with a very lonely Abraham Lincoln (or Atticus Finch)  in the center.

	161   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY					161

	The elevator doors ding open, and out walks Russell Hammond.
	The Secretary has just finished answering the phone, "Straight
	Arrow Publishers."  She puts the caller on hold.

					RUSSELL
			Hi, I'm Russel Hammond.

					SECRETARY
			You're here regarding?

					RUSSELL
			My life.

	162   INT. EDITORIAL OFFICE - DAY					162

	Russell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits
	on the walls.  He's behind enemy lines, and he knows it.
	Everything in the room fascinates him.

					RUSSELL
			I don't care what happens.  I don't
			care if you put us on the cover.  But
			you sent us a kid and... and he was a
			fan.   And we all made friends with
			him - absolutely, to get a good story.
			But then we actually liked him.  We
			thought he's... show us our lives in
			some mythic way and I guess... we're
			not mythic.  We panicked.

					JANN
			You denied most of the story.

					RUSSELL
			Yeah, well, here's the problem with
			the truth.  It's too true -

					BEN
			Well, we appreciate the visit.  The
			last time an artist came here, it was
			Buddy Miles and he punched me.

					RUSSELL
			I'm not punching anybody.  I am
			personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a
			voyage of self-reinvention.  This is
			about William Miller.
				(counting off fingers)
			He lives with us, he lost his virginity,
			he saw us at our worst, appreciated
			our best, he saved two lives, including
			mine... he smuggled about a half-pound
			of pot into Boston, and we never even
			told him -

	Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an
	eyebrow.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			-- we told him too much, we told him
			everything...  He almost died with us
			over Tupelo... if the band survives
			him, it'll be a miracle... but you
			know, he tried to keep up, and that's
			a journalist to me.

					JANN
			It's too late.  We're going with a
			different cover.

					RUSSELL
				(immediately)
			Thank God.

	But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead
	legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of
	them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin.  A second thought.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			You tell me it's too late.  But I could
			go back to my hotel room and... and
			O.D. tonight and something tells me
			you'd find a way to put me on the cover
			of the next issue.  Am I right?

	He looks at their faces.  They cannot disagree.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			I'm learning the game.
				(beat, shrug)
			We fucked up.  We made friends with him.

					BEN
			Next time we'll all be more
			professional.

					RUSSELL
			Maybe so.
				(beat, an odd thought)
			But God forbid, the day comes when
			selling yourself is as important as
			the music you make.
				(rueful, to Hendrix on the
			wall)
			You might have died at the right time,
			my friend.

					JANN
			Thank you for visiting.  Good luck.

					RUSSELL
			Do what you want, but the story is
			true.

	LONG SHOT RUSSELL

	at the entrance.  Raises his hand.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Good evening!

	162A  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY						162A

	Russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go.
	Oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to
	speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a
	music of its own.  It's a beautiful and compelling "silence."
	He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath
	of life.  His head filling again with the music of the world,
	he begins to walk down the street.  Very naturally, and quite
	randomly, he is noticed by young passersby.  They can't help
	it.  He looks like a star.  They can't quite figure out who it
	is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the
	street.   Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought,
	a small crowd begins to form... following him.

	163   INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY					163

	A quiet kitchen.  Anita has been cooking.  A substantial
	breakfast has been placed on the table.  Sausage, orange
	juice... and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with
	syrup and butter, in front of her mother.  William watches his
	mother facing an old enemy - white sugar.

					ANITA
			They're called pancakes.  Who knows
			when we'll be together again.  Splurge.
			It's what most people call breakfast.

	Mom looks at her children, and takes a breath.

					ELAINE
			I went through your records.  And I
			found a song to play for you.

	She goes to the stereo and puts on a record.  The two children
	eye each other - what's coming next?  (Song to be chosen)
	The two kids eye each other again.  Self-consciously avoiding
	their gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast.  It's a song
	she clearly wants them to hear.  It's a song from the heart.
	They look at her, amazed.  Elaine looks up, regards her family.
	Somehow they're back at this table.  They continue eating
	breakfast.

	164   ON SIDEWALK							164

	Bam.  A bundle of bound Rolling Stone Magazines lands on the
	newsstand pavement with a thud.  Someone reaches in to cut the
	cord, as the magazines puff up into view.  It's the new issue,
	with Russell Hammond on the cover.  The title: Stillwater Runs
	Deep.  Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in
	the racks.

									FADE OUT

	Music segues to Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks."  Penny Lane's
	sleeping Polaroid shots of our characters, featuring a few
	self-portraits.

					THE END
UNTITLED


























	 Cameron Crowe
	 December, 1998







					UNTITLED

	1	FADE IN								1

	A close-shot of a yellow legal tablet.  A young hand comes
	into frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only
	the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written
	in a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and
	corrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of
	an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we
	now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song."

	2	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY					2

	A lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky.  Behind
	it, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of
	San Diego.  A dry, hot Southern California day.  Even the wind
	is lazy, and a little bored.

	3	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER - DAY				3

	Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he
	collects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the
	Southland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly
	thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.

	Turning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.
	She is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's

	Having with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They
	stand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the
	highly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering
	fake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the
	commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual
	conversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing
	letters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY...
	now he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always
	pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.

					ELAINE
			Excuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no
			word in The English Language -- "Xmas."
			It's either Merry Christmas... or Happy
			Holidays.

	The Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns
	away.  The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs -
	that's my Mom.

	TITLE: 1969

	4	EXT.  MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX -- DAY				4

	This is the new professional-class.  It's a mini-condo
	community.  Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with
	common walls.   Move in on one of these homes, the one without
	Christmas lights.  At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl.
	She checks her cheek, straightens her hair.  She hides
	something under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance
	to enter.  Music fades.

	5	INT. KITCHEN -- DAY						5

	We now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her
	son, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets.
	The meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan.  Across the kitchen
	we see William.  He's a great listener, with a calm and curious
	face that takes everything in.

					WILLIAM
			- so Livia -

					ELAINE
			-- killed everyone off so her son
			Tiberius could inherit the throne.
				(thoughtful pause)
			Just like Nixon.

	William nods, intrigued.  He has a good disposition.  The
	world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings
	out in his Mom.  There is a small clatter at the front door,
	as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes.
	She silently curses herself.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Anita, is that you?

					ANITA'S VOICE
			Hey Mom!  I already ate.

	Mom moves to the living room to greet William's sister.  William
	peers into the next room.

	6	INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY						6

	She's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches
	her.  We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close.  She is an alluring
	young Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.

					ELAINE
			You sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.

	The words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl.

					ANITA
			I'm fine.  Already ate.

	William stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as
	Mom moves closer to his sister.  She sees something curious
	about her daughter.

					ELAINE
			Wait.  You've been kissing.

					ANITA
				(too quickly)
			No I haven't.

					ELAINE
				(peering at her lips)
			Yes... yes, you have...

					ANITA
			No I haven't.

					ELAINE
			Yes you have.  I can tell.

					ANITA
				(boldly)
			You can't tell.

	Mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully.
	To her, everything is a quest for knowledge.

					ELAINE
			Not only can I tell, I know who it is.
			It's Darryl.

	Anita is stunned silent.  She turns slightly to look at herself
	in a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself
	immediately.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			And what have you got under your coat?

	This is the booty Anita didn't want to give up.  Mom picks at
	the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket.
	She withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends.

					ANITA
				(busted)
			It's unfair that we can't listen to
			our music!

					ELAINE
				(weary of the issue)
			Honey, it's all about drugs and
			promiscuous sex.

					ANITA
			Simon and Garfunkel is poetry!

					ELAINE
			Yes it's poetry.  It's the poetry of
			drugs and promiscuous sex.  Look at
			the picture on the cover...

	CLOSE ON BOOKENDS ALBUM COVER

	Mom's fingers at the edges.  We examine the insolent faces on
	Richard Avedon's classic album cover.  Even Simon and Garfunkle
	look guilty under her scholarly inspection.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			... honey, they're on pot.

					ANITA
			First it was butter, then sugar and
			white flour.
				(beat)
			Bacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll,
			motorcycles.

	Nearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating
	conversation.  Anita glances at her brother.  He silently
	urges her to downshift.  She can't.

					ANITA (cont'd)
			Then it was celebrating Christmas on a
			day in September When you knew it
			wouldn't be "commercialized."

					ELAINE
			That was an experiment.  But I
			understand -

					ANITA
			What else are you going to ban?

					ELAINE
			Honey, you want to rebel against
			knowledge.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			I'm trying to give you the Cliff's
			Notes on how to live in this world.

					ANITA
				(simple and direct)
			We're like nobody else I know.

	These are the words that sting Mom most.

					ELAINE
			I'm a teacher.  Why can't I teach my
			own kids?
				(pats chest)
			Use me.

					ANITA
			Darryl says you use knowledge to keep
			me down.  He says I'm a "yes" person
			and you're trying to raise us in a
			"no" environment!

					ELAINE
				(immediately, can't help
			it)
			Well, clearly, "no" is a word Darryl
			doesn't hear much.

	Anita gasps.  Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in.  Nearby
	is a poster - "No More War."

					WILLIAM
			Mom --

					ELAINE
			Everything I say is wrong.

					ANITA
			I can't live here!  I hate you!  Even
			William hates you!

					WILLIAM
			I don't hate her.

					ANITA
				(to William)
			You don't even know the truth!

	William looks vaguely confused.

					ELAINE
			Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen.

	Anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the
	strangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for
	the first time.

					ANITA
			Feck  you!  All of you!

					ELAINE
			Hey!

	Anita runs down the hall to her room.  Elaine turns to William,
	relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Well, there it is.  Your sister using
			the "f" word.

					WILLIAM
			I think she said "feck."

					ELAINE
				(sputtering)
			What's the difference?

					WILLIAM
				(encouraging)
			Well.  The letter "u"...

	Shot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of
	The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin."

	7	INT.   SCHOOL DANCE/GYMNASIUM BATHROOM -- NIGHT			7

	Music continues.  Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking
	male teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror.
	There's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid
	proudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some
	Hai Karate), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the
	face of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and
	then a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down,
	down to find William.  He is so much younger, without a zit in
	sight.  Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.

	8	INT. DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-CRANKED				 8

	Song continues as we see William's perspective of these much-
	older looking kids.  Girls now are visible, and they are even
	more mature than the boys we've just seen.  They flirt and
	glow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys.
	Whispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down.
	It's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring
	world of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Are you really in our grade?

	9	INT. JUNIOR HIGH LOCKER ROOM -- DAY				  9

					VOICE
				(louder)
			Are you really in our grade?

	William turns to see tall, adenoidal TIM TOBIN.  The most mature
	looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud
	theatrical tone.  It is a voice right out of Guys and Dolls,
	which incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just
	starred.  William answers in a respectful voice.  He is
	desperate for acceptance.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					TOBIN
			Hey guys!  Check it out!  William
			doesn't have any pubes!

	Others now begin to gather around, examining William.  He has
	never been more naked.

					GUY # 1
			How old are you man?

					TOBIN
			He's not a man, he's a little baby
			kid.  He Doesn't even get zits yet.

					GUY # 2
			How come you don't have any hair down
			there?

					TOBIN
				(in loud, funny voice)
			Where are your pubes???!!

	Their voices echo off the tiled walls.  Now everyone is watching
	the hairless William.  He is confused by their meanness.

					GUY # 2
			Yeah.  Where are your pubes?

	All eyes are on him, waiting for a response.  The kid's mental
	wheels turn frantically.  And from somewhere comes an attitude,
	a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could
	only be a merciful deity.

					WILLIAM
				(cool, dismissive)
			I had 'em.  I shaved 'em off.

	It is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy.  And it works.
	Guy #2 cracks up, then others.  William's new accuser is
	suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these
	older boys.  Others turn away, on to other things.  Tobin stares
	at William, and then also turns away.

	10    INT. FAMILY CAR -- DAY						10

	William jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan
	station wagon, carrying books.  ("See ya pubes!")  Mom continues
	driving William and Anita home from school.

					ELAINE
				(cheerfully, by rote, to
			William in back)
			Put on your seatbelt.   I don't want
			you flying through the windshield.

	Anita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't
	noticed.

					WILLIAM
			We got our annuals today --

					ELAINE
				(cheerful, automatic)
			"Received" your annual.

					WILLIAM
				(looking at his photo)
			I look so much younger than everyone
			else.

					ELAINE
			Enjoy it while you can.

	Camera drifts from Mom to Anita, who can take it no longer.

					ANITA
			Mom.  It's time.

					ELAINE
				(pleasant, pointed)
			Can this wait until we get home?

					ANITA
			Mom, pull over.  Tell him the truth.
			Tell him how old he is.

	Mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.

					ELAINE
				(as in "be quiet")
			He knows how old he is.

					ANITA
			The other kids make fun of him because
			of How young he looks.  Nobody includes
			him.

	They call him "The Narc" behind his back...

					WILLIAM
			They do?

					ELAINE
			What's a "Narc?"

					ANITA
			(bleeding for her brother)
			A Narcotics Officer!

					ELAINE
			Well what's wrong with that?

					WILLIAM
				(ever the peacemaker)
			Come on you guys.  It's no big deal.
			I'm 12.  It's okay. She skipped me a
			grade, it's okay.  Big deal.   I'm a
			year younger.  They're 13, I'm 12 --
				(beat)
			Aren't I?

	Their silence is eloquent.

					ELAINE
				(confessing, in a rush)
			I also put you in first grade when you
			were five and never told you.

					WILLIAM
				(trembling)
			So...  I'm... how old?

	A heavy quiet.  She and his sister ignore him, as they now
	debate the subject with each other.

					ANITA
			You lied to him!  You make such a big
			deal about the truth and you lied!

					ELAINE
				(that one hurts)
			He never asked.

					ANITA
			What -- like he's going to ask if he's
			as old as he thinks he is?  Don't you
			realize, this is going to scar him
			forever?

					ELAINE
			Honey... sweetheart... don't be
			Cleopatra.  We have to be his mother
			and his Dad.

					ANITA
			You put too much pressure on him!

					WILLIAM
				(apprehensive)
			How... old...

					ANITA
			And when he rebels in some strange and
			odd way, don't blame me.

					WILLIAM
			... am I?

					ELAINE
				(matter of fact)
			I skipped you an extra grade.  You're
			eleven.

					WILLIAM
			(horrified, voice crackling)
			ELEVEN?

	He looks at his body, the information affects him physically.
	New sounds come from way down deep inside.  Mom now begins
	speed-rapping, trying to stem the leak.  She starts the car.

					ELAINE
			So you skipped fifth grade.  There's
			too  much padding In the grades.  I
			taught elementary school.  5th grade -
			unnecessary.  Nothing happens in the
			5th grade.  All Teachers know it, no
			one talks about it.

					WILLIAM
				(still in shock)
			E - leven.

					ELAINE
			And you skipped kindergarten because I
			taught it to you when you were four.

					WILLIAM
			(still horrified, looking
			 at his body)
			This explains... so much...

					ANITA
			You've robbed him of an adolescence!

					ELAINE
			Adolescence is a marketing tool.

					ANITA
			He's got no "crowd"... no friends...

					WILLIAM
			Okay!

	Anita reaches out to her brother.  With the compassion of a
	saint, she offers this:

					ANITA
			Honey, I know you were expecting
			puberty.  You're just going to have to
			shine it on for a while.

	Deeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat.  Mom
	monitors his face constantly.  She is raw and sincere... and
	yes, inspiring:

					ELAINE
			Who needs a "crowd?"  You're unique.  You're
			two years ahead of everybody.  Take those
			extra years and do what you want.  Go to
			Europe for a year!  Take a look around,
			see what you like!  Follow your dream!
			You'll still be the youngest lawyer in the
			country.  Your own great grandfather
			practiced law until he was 93.  Your dad
			was so proud of you.  He knew you were a
			pronominally accelerated child.

					ANITA
			What about me?

					ELAINE
				(heartbroken, can't help
			herself)
			You're rebellious and ungrateful of my
			love.

					ANITA
			Well, somebody's gotta be normal around
			here!

					WILLIAM
				(blinking, still can't
			believe it)
			Eleven.

	11    INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY					11

	William finishes the last of many candy bars.  A mound of
	wrappers sit just below the mirror.  He examines his face
	hopefully for zits.  Nothing coming.  We begin to hear Simon
	and Garfunkel's "America."

	12    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY						12

	Anita stands in the living room.   The song continues playing
	on the stereo.

					ANITA
			I want to play you a song that explains
			why I'm leaving, and try to listen.

					ELAINE
			We can't talk?  We have to listen to
			rock music?

	13    EXT. FRONT LAWN -- DAY						13

	William watches sadly.  Anita's good-looking boyfriend DARRYL,
	a dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases
	into a large turqouise Chevy.  The suitcases are adorned with
	plastic stick-on flowers.    All coolness is leaving William's
	life.  Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless.   (Their house
	is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)

					WILLIAM
			Take good care of her in San Francisco,
			man.

	Darryl gives the kid a sub-human look.  He's invisible, too
	young to converse with.

					ELAINE
			How can she leave such a loving family?

	Anita turns and heads towards them.  She focuses on William,
	placing her hands on his young shoulders.  Her face is very
	close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the
	future.

					ANITA
			One day you'll be cool.

	He nods stoically, hopefully.  He is utterly lost.  She leans
	forward and whispers in his ear.

					ANITA (cont'd)
			Look under your bed.  It'll set you
			free.

	Anita shakes hands with Mom, and exits.  As the car takes off:

					ELAINE
			She'll be back.

	In the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.

					ANITA
			YEAHHHHH-HOOOOOOOO.

					ELAINE
			Maybe not soon...

	William watches wistfully.  He moves away from his mother.
	She pulls him closer.  Shot moves in on his slightly fearful
	face.

	14    INT. DARRYL'S CAR - DAY						14

	Anita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her
	mother and brother.  Sister waves to brother.  She feels for
	him.  Music now shifts to The Who's "Sparks."

	15    INT. BEDROOOM -- NIGHT						15

	William locks the door.  He reaches under his bed.  It's a
	black leatherette travel bag, with tartan design.  He unzips
	the bag -- it's filled with albums.  He flips through the
	amazing, subversive cache of music.  Cream's Wheels of Fire...
	the seminal Bob Dylan bootleg Great White Wonder... the Rolling
	Stones' Get Yer Ya Ya's Out... The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds...
	Abraxas by Santana... Jethro Tull's Stand Up... The Mother's of
	Invention's We're Only In It For The Money...  Led Zeppelin...
	Crosby, Stills and Nash... Miles Davis' Bitches Brew... and
	The Who's Tommy... with a note taped to it.

					ANITA (V.O.)
			"Listen to Tommy with a candle burning
			and you will see your entire future..."

	The heady effect of all these albums registers, as we see him
	lighting a candle.

	TITLE:  1973

	DETAIL SHOT OF NOTEBOOK

	A blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the
	names of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with
	carefully drawn thunderbolts.  Also, the name LESTER BANGS.

	16    INT. JOURNALISM CLASS -- DAY					16

	William, now 15, sits in class with book, Adventures in
	Journalism.  His hair is shoulder-length.  A dedicated teacher,
	PATRICIA DEEGAN, walks the aisles.  Music continues.

	17    EXT. FOOD MACHINES - DAY						17

	William presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from
	a vending container.  He still looks younger than most of the
	students... and these days, especially the girls.

	18    EXT. LUNCH COURT -- DAY						18

	William sits apart from all the others, under a tree.  He reads
	intently, happily, as he eats the orange.  It's a copy of Creem
	Magazine.  Music continues.

	CLOSE ON PHOTOS IN MAGAZINE

	Camera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and
	fashions of the rock heroes of the day.  Ian Anderson of Jethro
	Tull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute.  Neil Young,
	enigmatic with perfectly patched Levis.  The Southern Rock Royalty
	of The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of
	massive stacks of amps.  Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair
	backlit by stage lights.  David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one-
	piece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars.  Pete Townsend
	of the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.

	Drift down to a by-line - by Lester Bangs.

	19    EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY						19

	William walks through the parking lot after school.  Everybody
	now congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their
	own cars.  Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly
	faces smile strangely, laughing.  He takes a few steps and
	looks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing
	something from the high-school marquee.

	HIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE

	which reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)

	All are laughing.  He laughs with them, and turns as his face
	goes slack.  He shrugs, marches on.

	20    EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RADIO STATION -- DAY			20

	The song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by
	a highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the
	greatness of The Guess Who.  He is a ferocious, lumbering, music-
	driven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the
	very brim.  This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a
	then new art-form -- Rock Journalism.  A Disc-jockey with long-
	long hair watches helplessly.  William views all this through a
	glass window.  He stands on the corner of a downtown side
	street, halfway up a steep incline.  He is the only person on
	the streets this early Saturday morning.  Reveal that he is
	watching a live radio show, audible to us through the small
	p.a. speaker overhead.

					DISC-JOCKEY
			Quite an honor to have the World's
			Greatest Rock Critic... and editor of
			Creem Magazine, back Home in San Diego
			for a few days -- Lester Bangs.

					LESTER BANGS
			What is this hippie station?!  Where's
			Iggy Pop?  Don't you have a copy of
			Raw Power?!

					DISC-JOCKEY
			Lester, isn't it a little early for
			this?

	Bangs searches for the album -- vinyl flying everywhere now,
	with no regard for album jackets.

					BANGS
			Found it!!

	21    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY						21

	William watches intently.  Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy
	of Raw Power.   We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the
	Stooges' "Search and Destroy."   A closer shot on William now
	watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside.  Lester does an Iggy
	Pop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot
	hear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the
	other side of this double-glass window.

	22    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATER				22

	Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego
	street.  It's early, the streets are silent.  Bangs is about
	fifteen beer pounds overweight.  His jeans are loose, his
	paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and
	nights spent writing.  In there somewhere is a good-looking
	guy.  His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he
	takes big sweeping steps.

					BANGS
			So you're the one who's been sending
			me those articles from your school
			newspaper -

					WILLIAM
			I've been doing some stuff for a local
			underground paper, too.

					BANGS
			What are you like the star of your
			school?

					WILLIAM
			They hate me.

					BANGS
			You'll meet them all again on their
			long journey to the middle.

	The kid nods, they walk.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			Well, your writing is damn good.  It's
			just a shame you missed out on rock
			and roll.

					WILLIAM
			I did?

					BANGS
			Oh yeah.  It's over.

					WILLIAM
			Over?

					BANGS
			Over.  You got here just in time for
			the death rattle, the last gasp, the
			last grope.

					WILLIAM
			Well.  At least I'm here for that.

	Bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head.  It's
	too late for newcomers.  But if the kid's age is an issue, he
	doesn't mention it.  Like a machine-gun:

					BANGS
			What do you type on?

					WILLIAM
			Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

					BANGS
			You like the new Lou Reed?

					WILLIAM
				(automatic)
			The early stuff.  The new stuff, he's
			trying to be Bowie, he should be
			himself.  I'm not a big Lou man.

					BANGS
			Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and
			Lou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing
			Lou.

					WILLIAM
				(standing his ground)
			If you like Lou.

					BANGS
			Take drugs?

					WILLIAM
			No.

					BANGS
			Smart kid.  I used to do speed and
			sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night
			writing and writing, like 25 pages of
			dribble about, you know, the Guess
			Who, or Coltrane, just to write, you
			know, with the music blasting...

					WILLIAM
			Me too.  The writing part...

	For a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest
	thing happens.  Bangs laughs.  It's an odd and charming laugh,
	the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden.  It surprised the kid,
	who smiles back.  Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a
	pleasant but very final nod of the head.

					BANGS
			Well, alright.  It's been nice to meet
			you.  I'll see you around.  Keep sending
			me your stuff.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  See you.

					BANGS
			I can't stand here all day talking to
			my many fans.

	WIDE SHOT - SOLITUDE

	But neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning.
	They stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted
	street.  They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.

	23    INT. DINER -- DAY							23

	William listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich.  His face
	is an open book filling with words.

					BANGS
			-- so anyway, you're from San Diego
			and that's good.  Because once you go
			to L.A., you're gonna have friends
			like crazy but they'll be fake friends,
			they're gonna try to corrupt you.  The
			publicists!  The bands!  You got an
			honest face, they're gonna tell you
			everything.  But you CANNOT make friends
			with the rock stars.

	The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures --
	can I make a note?  Bangs nods.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			Cannot make friends with the rock stars.
				(savage bite)
			That's what's important.  If you're a rock
			journalist, a true journalist -- first you
			will never get paid much.  But you will
			get free records from the record company.

	The kid's eyes widen.  Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal
	writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate
	softie.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			And they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet
			girls... they'll try to fly you places for
			free.... offer you drugs...  I know.  It
			sounds great.  But they are not your
			friends.   These are people who want you
			to write sanctimonious stories about the
			genius of the rock stars and they will
			ruin rock and roll and strangle everything
			we love about it.

	Privately, William thrills.  We.  Our.  It all sounds great to
	him.  He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of
	them.  He madly scribbles.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			They are trying to buy respectability
			for a form that is gloriously and
			righteously -

	The kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word.

					BANGS (cont'd)
			- dumb!  And you're smart enough to
			know that.  And the day it ceases to
			be dumb is the day it ceases to be
			real.  Right?  And then it will just
			Become an Industry of Cool.

					WILLIAM
			... Industry... of... cool...

					BANGS
			And that's what they want!  And it's
			happening right now.  I'm telling you,
			you're coming along at a very dangerous
			time for rock and roll.  The war is
			over.  They won.  99% of what passes
			for rock now... SILENCE is much more
			compelling.  It's over.  I think you
			should turn around and go back and
			be... a lawyer or something... but I
			can see from your face that you won't.
			I can pay you thirty-five bucks.  Gimme
			a thousand words on Black Sabbath.

					WILLIAM
				(attempting cool)
			An assignment.

					LESTER
			Yeah.  And you should build your
			reputation on being honest... and
			unmerciful.

					WILLIAM
				(writing in notebook)
			Honest... unmerciful...

					BANGS
			And if you get into a jam -- call me.
			I stay up late.

	Bangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he
	scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate
	notebook.  The notebook has just become valuable.  They sit
	together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.

	24    INT. FAMILY CAR -- NIGHT						24

	Mom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena.  She looks
	out the window at the adrenalized concert-goers.  She feels
	protective not just of her son, but an entire generation.
	William goes over his questions for Black Sabbath.

					ELAINE
			Look at this.  An entire generation of
			Cinderellas and there's no slipper
			coming.

	William looks out the window at the sign: TONIGHT - SOLD OUT -
	BLACK SABBATH with special guest Stillwater.

					WILLIAM
			You can drop me off here.

					ELAINE
			Black.  Sabbath.  Just remember - you
			wanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill
			a Mockingbird.

	The kid doesn't answer.  He silently goes over his questions.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			As long as I know this is just a hobby,
			I'll go along with it.

					WILLIAM
			All I have to do is listen.  That's
			what Lester Bangs said.

					ELAINE
				(dryly)
			I'll be waiting right here at eleven
			'o clock sharp.  If you get lost, use
			the family whistle.

	He unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange
	canvas shoulder-bag and exits.

	Elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert
	crowd.  It's a windy night.  Everything about this image
	troubles her.  She fights with herself, and then uses the family
	whistle immediately.  He turns.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
				(sweetly, too loud)
			Don't take drugs!!

	Fifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound
	of a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her
	concern.  All around him, we hear:

					HAPPY CONCERT GOERS
			Don't take drugs!!

	He winces, nods and moves forward.  Music echoes from the open
	windows of many other cars.

	25    EXT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA BACKSTAGE RAMP -- NIGHT		 25

	The kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel
	backstage arena door.  He rings the buzzer.  The door wheezes
	open to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's
	backstage list.  Famous to all those who attempt to enter,
	this is SCOTTY.  He is a wiry, humorless man for whom
	powerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few
	hours he controls the list.  Scotty is only forty but everything
	about him screams that he's an angry sixty.

					WILLIAM
			Hi.  I'm William Miller and I'm here
			from Creem Magazine to interview the
			band Black Sabbath.

	Scotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and
	snaps through three clipboard pages.  He moves back to the
	door and grabs the handle.

					SCOTTY
			Not on the list.

	He shuts the door with finality.  The kid stands silently for
	a moment.  He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering
	Groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp.  They
	look at him sympathetically, but he turns away.  William rings
	the buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of Creem from his bag.
	The door opens.

					WILLIAM
			Sir, I'm a journalist, and here's a
			copy of the magazine.

	The magazine hangs in mid-air.

					SCOTTY
			You're not on the list.   Go to the
			top of the ramp with the girls!

	Slam.  William stands there for a moment.  Unsure of what to
	do next, he looks back to the top of the ramp.  Rejected by
	him just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest.
	Bracing himself, William rings again.  The door opens slowly
	this time.  Scotty stands peering at him.

					WILLIAM
				(in a rush)
			What-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of-
			the-ramp with-the-gi -

	Slam.  Lock.

	26    EXT. TOP OF SPORTS ARENA RAMP -- NIGHT				26

	William inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the
	ramp.  The wind whips.  It's just him, and two Groupies in
	their evening best.  They now pretend to barely notice the
	young journalist who has been banished to stand with them.
	Chattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17
	years, is ESTRELLA.  She sports long unruly black hair.  Her
	partner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes.  Estrella turns
	to the kid with great disinterest.

					ESTRELLA
			Who are you with?

					WILLIAM
				(embarrassed to be alive)
			Me?  I'm with myself.

					ESTRELLA
			No, who are you with?  What band?

					WILLIAM
			I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
				(beat)
			I'm a journalist.  I'm not a... you
			know...

	Estrella stares at him.  Moving into the parking lot light,
	introducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur
	trimmed coat.  This is PENNY LANE.  There is an inviting warmth
	and real interest in the way she asks:

					PENNY LANE
			... you're not a what?

					WILLIAM
				(enthralled)
			Oh... I'm just... not a... you know.

					PENNY LANE
			Not a "what"?

					WILLIAM
				(charmed)
			You know.  A "groupie."

	The two girls are deeply insulted by the word.

					ESTRELLA
			Ohhh!

					WILLIAM
			Sorry, I -

					PENNY LANE
			We.  Are not.  "Groupies."

	Estrella indicates Penny with great reverence.

					ESTRELLA
			This is Penny Lane, man.  Show some
			respect.

					WILLIAM
			-- sorry.

	Penny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid.  Behind
	her, concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way.  She seems
	not to hear them.

					PENNY LANE
			"Groupies" sleep with rock stars because
			they want to be near someone famous.
			We are here because of the music.  We
			are Band Aids.

					ESTRELLA
			She used to run a school for Band Aids.

					PENNY LANE
			We don't have intercourse with these
			guys.  We support the music.  We inspire
			the music.  We are here because of the
			music.

	William is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window.
	Listening.

					ESTRELLA
			Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.  It's
			famous.

					PENNY LANE
			It's a long story.  I'm retired now.
			I'm just visiting friends.

					ESTRELLA
			She was the one who changed everything.
			She said "no more sex, no more
			exploiting our bodies and hearts... "

					WILLIAM
			Right.  Right.

					ESTRELLA
			"... just blow-jobs, and that's it."

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  Well, see, now I get the
			difference.

	Shot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another
	breathless girl teetering on tall shoes.  She is in the vicinity
	of 16.  Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just
	like the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane.  She is POLEXIA, the
	voluptuous one, from Riverside.

					POLEXIA
				(the usual greeting)
			It's all happening.  It's all happening.

					ESTRELLA
			Polexia!!   Did you tell Sabbath we
			were going to be here?

					POLEXIA
			I talked to Dick with Stillwater, I
			talked with Sabbath.  They're all dying
			to see us.   It's all happening.

					PENNY LANE
			This is our journalist friend.
			Journalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr,
			and Polexia Aphrodisia. And you are --

					WILLIAM
			William.

	Silent beat.  His name lands like a thud.

					POLEXIA
			Here comes Sabbath!

					ESTRELLA
			Ozzy!!!  Tony!!!  It's us!!

	A long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps
	twice.  The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls
	inside.  And then silence again.  The girls do not discuss
	being rebuffed.

					ESTRELLA (cont'd)
			I think I saw Sapphire in there.

					POLEXIA
				(can't hold it in any longer)
			Okay.  I was with Ian Hunter all night
			at Rodney's Last night.  Wanna see his
			spoo?  I saved it in a baggie.

	She opens her purse and shows the girls something inside.
	William edges away.

					ESTRELLA
				(peering into purse)
			I'm really happy he's doing so well.

					PENNY
				(regarding what's in purse)
			Yeah.  I know he's such a talented
			guy.  I mean, look at him.  Who deserves
			it more?

					POLEXIA
				(looking in purse)
			Nobody -- he's so sweet.

					ESTRELLA
				(with compassion)
			Don't you just root for him, you know.
			To go that little distance between
			good and great?

					PENNY
			Wait.  That's not his.  I would know
			his.

	A very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet
	look.  What's in that purse?

	BAM -- THE BACKSTAGE DOOR OPENS

	Out steps SAPPHIRE, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms.  Heavy
	eye-makeup.  Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English.
	In one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne.  In the other,
	a fistful of backstage passes.

					SAPPHIRE
			Does anybody remember laugh-tah?
				(as they turn)
			Come and GET 'EM!

	The girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire.
	Penny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked
	around his.  He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the
	ramp.  Sapphire slaps passes on the girls.  As Scotty (The
	Keeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William
	forward for a pass.

					SCOTTY
			Oh no.  Not this one --

					SAPPHIRE
				(off William)
			Who brought Opie?

	The kid looks over his shoulder.  Who's Opie?

					PENNY
			He's with us.

					SCOTTY
				(hand blocking William)
			He wasn't with you.

					SAPPHIRE
				(to Scotty)
			Are you going to turn this into a
			Thing?

					SCOTTY
			All of you can wait outside!  Top of
			the ramp!

					WILLIAM
			I don't want to cause a Thing.  I'll
			wait.

					PENNY
				(privately, to William)
			I'll go take care of this.

	Sadly, they leave him behind.  The thundering arena sound of
	the collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes'
	"Roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases...
	the glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants
	to be a part of is on the other side of this door.  And then
	it shuts.  He stands alone.

	At the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads.  It reads --
	STILLWATER TOUR 73.  Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening
	band.  This is Stillwater.  Four road-weary band members, and
	their road manager.  Voices booming.

	RUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his
	guitar-case.  It's obvious from moment one.  This is the star
	of the band, the charismatic one.  He's tired.  They're late.
	William recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches.
	The buzzer goes unanswered.  The kid is invisible to him, as
	the others now arrive behind Russell.

	Tour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on
	the steel door.  He has the flaxen-haired look of a former
	hippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest
	silver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes.
	His direction is always - forward.

					DICK
			Let us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on
			the show!!

	William is surrounded by them now.  They stand together under the
	single lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover.  JEFF
	BEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his
	head.  ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging
	limply at his sides.  His is a face made for the background. LARRY
	TURNER the compact bass-player.   Dick now kicks at the door with
	his foot, as William produces a copy of Creem Magazine.

					WILLIAM
				(to Dick)
			Hi, I'm a journalist.  I write for Creem
			Magazine.

	Once again, the magazine hangs there.  He can't give it away.

					JEFF
			The enemy!  A rock writer!

					WILLIAM
				(struggling forward)
			I'd like to interview you or someone
			from the band.

					DICK
				(busy, running behind)
			I'm sorry but could you please fuck
			off?

	William blinks a little, takes it in stride.  Russell sizes
	him up, moving in the background.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  Okay.  I could do that.

					JEFF
			You guys never listened to our records.
			You're all just frustrated musicians.
			Do you know what your magazine SAID
			about us?  What was it - "the singer's
			incessant cater walling distracts From
			an assault with no clear purpose."

					LARRY
				(in background)
			That was Rolling Stone.

					RUSSELL
			Yeah.  Okay.  Fuck off anyway.  We
			play for fans, not critics.

	Stung, William shrugs.  It's been a terrible night, but at
	least thrillingly so.

					WILLIAM
			Russell.  Jeff.  Ed.   Larry.
				(can't help it)
			I really love your band.   I think the
			song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward
			for you guys.  I think you guys
			producing it yourselves, instead of
			Glyn Johns, was the right thing to do.
			And the guitar sound was incendiary.
				(gestures with fist)
			Way to go.

	He turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp.
	Russell looks at the others.  That kind of love is hard to
	give up.

					RUSSELL
				(good humored, yelling)
			Well don't stop there.

					JEFF
			Yeah, come back here!!  Keep going!

	They wave him back, as the backstage door opens again.  The
	kid moves back down the ramp.   They herd him in with them,
	through the door.  Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares
	off.

	Russell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him
	forward.

					SCOTTY
			Not this one.

					RUSSELL
			He's with us.

					SCOTTY
			He's not with you.  He's not with them.
			He's not on the list.  He's not coming
			in.  And this is my arena.  And
			furthermore -

	Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to
	Scotty.

					SCOTTY (cont'd)
			- have a good time tonight.   Welcome
			to San Diego.

	27    INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY -- NIGHT					27

	The band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving
	to keep up.  A young and grizzled red-haired roadie, RED DOG,
	catches them on the way.  The band swarms around him.

					RUSSELL
			Red Dog!

					RED DOG
			We're playing here tomorrow night.

					JEFF
				(aside, to the kid)
			This is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers
			Band's number one roadie.

	Russel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck.

					RUSSELL
			How're the guys?

					RED DOG
			Havin a ball, man.  When we have a
			party, we have an Allman Brothers Band
			party.  Everybody boogies.  Everybody
			gets off.  It's family, man.  We all got
			These now.
				(flashes new mushroom tattoo
			on forearm)
			We'll see you guys in Boston, right?
				(specifically to Russell)
			Dicky and Gregg send you their love.

	Camera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as
	Stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room.

	28    INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT					28

	Dressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply
	listens.  He holds a small microphone.  His stoic look gives away
	little of the full body rush he's experiencing.  As the other
	band members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and
	roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready
	for the show.  To the kid, every word is reckless gem.

					RUSSELL
			... and it's okay, because rock and
			roll is a LIFESTYLE...  and a way of
			thinking and it's not about money and
			"popularity!"

					JEFF
			Some money would be nice.

	Jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into
	his scalp - poor man's mousse.

					RUSSELL
			- but it's a voice that says here I
			am... and FUCK YOU if you can't
			understand me.

	Russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth
	from his guitar case.  The kid notices all these close-up
	details of rock.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			And one of those people is gonna save the
			world and that means that ROCK AND ROLL
			CAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together.

	The kid's eyes dance.  He checks to make sure he's getting the
	recording.  He listens intently.

					JEFF
			And the chicks are great.

					RUSSELL
			But we didn't do it for that!  We are
			here because we needed to fuckin be
			here, not just 'cause we needed to
			away from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE
			DID... but what it all comes down to
			is that thing. The Indefinable Thing,
			when people catch something from your
			music, the thing you put into it.  I'm
			talking about... what am I talking
			about?

					WILLIAM
				(elegantly)
			The buzz?

					RUSSELL
			THE BUZZ!   And the chicks, the
			whatever, is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ.
			And like -- you saying you liked "Fever
			Dog?"   That is the fucking buzz, man.
			All we get are these fucking old-ass
			interviewers who don't understand,
			don't LISTEN, don't appreciate why we
			are here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ.

	William nods, holds his microphone steady.  Russell tunes his
	guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks.
	Jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.

					JEFF
			The next album will be even better.
			More texture.

					RUSSELL
			But... it's not what you put in, is
			it?  It's what you leave out.  Listen
			to... listen to Marvin Gaye...

	Russell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of
	music.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			A song like "What's Going On."  That
			single "woo" at the end of the second
			verse - you know that woo - that single
			"woo."

					WILLIAM
				(proudly)
			I know that, "woo."

					RUSSELL
				(he does it)
			That's what you remember.  The silly
			things, the little things... there's
			only one, and it makes the song.  It's
			what you leave out.  That's rock and
			roll.

	William nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed.
	Activity surrounds him.

					JEFF
				(impressed)
			We used to talk more about this stuff.

					RUSSELL
			Okay.  See, this is maybe the most
			honest we've ever been in an interview
			because you know our music.  You're
			the first press guy we've made friends
			with.  We don't normally talk like
			this to them.  And you're supposed to
			be The Enemy!  What are you - 18?

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			There you go.  Still young enough to
			be honest.

					DICK
				(walkie talkie crackling)
			Ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who
			isn't in the band -- out!

	Russell takes a last swig of beer.  A roadie whisks his guitar
	away.

					DICK (cont'd)
			All this luggage is going to L.A.!

	William is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual,
	past the pile of luggage by the door.  It's a colorful heap of
	suitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a
	number.

	29    INT. BACKSTAGE STEPS -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER			29

	William sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his
	notebook.  Behind him, two steps higher, Penny Lane scoots
	into place.

					PENNY LANE
			I found you a pass.

					WILLIAM
				(amped, distracted)
			Thanks.  I got in with Stillwater.
				(as he writes)
			The guitarist, Russel Hammond, he
			just thoroughly opened up.  He is by
			far the best and most honest interview
			I've ever done.
				(she nods)
			I've only done two, but you know.
			He's number one.

					PENNY LANE
			You're learning.  They're much more
			fun on the way up.

	William nods, still scribbling.  She eases down into place on
	the step next to him.  Her proximity cause him to look at
	her, his eyebrows rising.  She smooths them down with two single
	fingers.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			How old are you?

					WILLIAM
			Eighteen.

					PENNY LANE
			Me too.
				(beat)
			How old are we really?

					WILLIAM
			Seventeen.

					PENNY LANE
			Me too.

					WILLIAM
			Actually I'm 16.

					PENNY LANE
			Me too.  Isn't it funny?  The truth
			just sounds Different.

					WILLIAM
				(confesses)
			I'm 15.

					PENNY LANE
			You want to know how old I really am?

					WILLIAM
				(immediately)
			No.

	She looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning
	up.  Music is her religion.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			How did you get started in all this?

					PENNY LANE
			It's a long story.

					WILLIAM
				(quick study)
			Right.  Right.

					PENNY LANE
			We live in the same city.  We should
			be friends.

	She takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his
	thigh - the cooler location.  Nearby, the dressing room door
	opens, and the Stillwater exits.   Excitement level rises as
	they mass in the hallway with instruments.  We hear the amped
	voice of Russell growing nearer.

					RUSSELL
			The Enemy!

	He approaches, as William stands.  Penny watches, hanging out
	of Russell's eyesight.

	Standing in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to
	introduce his new friends.

					WILLIAM
			Russell, this is Penny Lane.

					PENNY LANE
				(stepping into view)
			Pleasure.

					RUSSELL
			Penny Lane?  Like the song, right?

					PENNY LANE
			Have we met?

	THEY SHAKE

	And do not let go, for too long.  There is history in their
	shake.  Their eyes tell all.  Shot takes us to William, who
	puts two and two together.  It isn't hard.  They clearly know
	each other. Well.

					WILLIAM
			Well, I guess you've... you've met.

					DICK
			Penny Lane!  God's gift to rock and
			roll!!  You're back!
				(privately)
			Marc Bolan.  Please.

	Other band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time,
	waiting in the hallway... and now singing the Beatles song
	"Penny Lane."

					RUSSELL
			Come on, let's go.
				(noting kid's shyness)
			Both of you.

	30    INT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT						30

	House lights go down.  Cheers rise.  Dick's flashlight dances
	on the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the
	dark to the stage steps.

					RUSSELL
			- get in the huddle.

	Russell pulls William into the band's huddle.

	SHOT LOOKING UP AT THEM

	Their band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's
	shoulders in a circle.  They sing a dew lines of the classic
	"Train Kept A-Rollin'" (or "Go See Cal" from the Cal Worthington
	ad) They all touch feet, and then break, heading for the stage.
	Russell directs Penny to his side of the stage.  The kid follows.
	Plugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord --
	thwack.  He steps on effects pedal.  Applause.  (Adlib onstage
	private patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff
	no audience ever hears)  Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to
	address the crowd from the darkened stage.  It is his favorite
	moment of the evening, the highlight of his job.

					DICK
			From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome --
				(importantly)
			Stillwater.

	Light hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening
	song, "If You Say Nothing."  Audience response is strong.
	Shot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most
	undeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty
	seconds.

	Jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some
	vocal pyrotechnics.  Russell looks over to Penny and William,
	at stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an
	elegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he
	belongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first
	guitar lead of the night.  The kid looks over to see Penny
	watching Russell.

	31    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT -- LATER					31

	Cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks.  Stillwater heads
	for their bus.  Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr,
	like a sailor leaving port.   Russell lingers behind, saying
	goodbye to William, loading his own equipment.  Black Sabbath
	passes with entourage, heading to the stage.

					RUSSELL
				(privately)
			So.  You want to come up to L.A., we'll
			be at the "Riot House" all week.

					WILLIAM
			"The Riot House?"

					RUSSELL
			The Continental Hyatt House!  It's on
			Sunset Strip.

					WILLIAM
				(attempting cool)
			Right.  Right.

	All the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the
	backstage crowd of hangers-on.  Looking perhaps for Penny Lane.

					DICK
			Let's blow this burg!

					RUSSELL
				(exiting)
			Well tell your friend Miss Penny Lane
			to Call Me.  Tell her "It ain't
			California without her.  We want her
			around like last summer."   Say it
			like that.

					WILLIAM
			Got it.

					RUSSELL
				(returns, whispers)
			Oh, I'm under the name - Harry Houdini.

					JEFF
				(exiting, to William)
			The Enemy!!  Yeah!!    Come to L.A.,
			we'll take some more.

	Russell joins Jeff, exiting and laughing.  A good show is still
	in the air.

					WILLIAM
			Later Jeff!  See you, Dick.  Larry.
			Ed.
				(and now the roadies)
			Mick, Gregg, Red Dog, Scully, Frosty,
			Estrella, The Wheel!

			ROADIES			   DICK
	  Laterrrr!			 We'll see you down the
						line.

	William is deliriously happy, hands upraised.  He turns to see
	Penny.

					WILLIAM
			PENNY!

					PENNY
				(calming him)
			Hey.  Hey.  Be cool.

					WILLIAM
			You just missed Russell!  He says he's
			at the "Riot House" all week and to call
			him.  He's under the name Harry Houdini.
			Do you know about the "Riot House?"

					PENNY LANE
			I think I've heard of it.

					WILLIAM
			He had a message for you!  He said,
			"It's not California without you.  We
			want you around like last summer."
				(consults notebook)
			Actually he said "ain't."  "It ain't
			California - "

					PENNY LANE
			I get the gist.

					WILLIAM
			How well do you guys know each other?

	She smiles privately.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			I got it.  No problem.  Long story.
			Alright!  I gotta go.

	Elsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing "Sweet
	Leaf."  The kid could care less.  He has bonded with Stillwater.
	He heads for the door.  Penny walks with him.  He's loving it.
	They pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they
	exit out into the ramp area.

	32    EXT. SPORTS ARENA -- NIGHT					32

	Penny takes out an eyeliner pencil, writes her number on the
	back of his green notebook.

					PENNY LANE
			Call me if you need a rescue.  We live
			in the same city.

					WILLIAM
			I think I live in a different world.

	They stand in the night air.  The parking lot is largely silent
	now, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath.  In
	the distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle.

					PENNY
			Speaking of the world.  I've made a
			decision.
				(a very serious secret)
			I'm going to live in Morocco for one
			year. I need a new crowd.

	He nods.  He is a rapt audience for this flashy girl.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			Do you want to come?

					WILLIAM
			Yes.

	In the distance, we hear the family whistle growing louder.

					PENNY
			It's a plan.  You've got to call me.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.

					PENNY
			It's all happening.

					WILLIAM
			It's all happening.

	He nods cooly.  He waits until she turns, and the sprints
	through the parking lot, to the distant family whistle.

								 FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	33    ON TAPE RECORDER							33

	William's fingers work the clunky keys, pressing rewind.  We
	hear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview,
	full of overlapping and barely discernible voices.
	Meticulously, he untangles the voices, especially Russell's,
	as he transcribes.

	INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

	The work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona
	Galaxis.  There is a knock at the window, and William scoots
	back in his chair to see a familiar face.  It is Darryl, his
	sister's old boyfriend.  William opens the window.

					WILLIAM
			Hey Darryl.

					DARRYL
			Hey.

	Darryl climbs in the window, looks around the room that was
	once the site of his previous glory.

					DARRYL (cont'd)
			So she's a stewardess now.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.  She and Mom are still sorta...
			I'd say "not speaking," but I don't
			know if they ever did.

					DARRYL
			Your sister.  A stewardess.
				(nods to himself)
			The things your sister and I did inside
			these four walls...

					WILLIAM
			That's okay.  I don't want to know.
			It's my room now.

					DARRYL
			We flew the friendly skies -

					WILLIAM
			Okay -

					DARRYL
			I don't want to put you in the middle
			of anything.  We don't have to talk
			about it.

					WILLIAM
			No.

					DARRYL
			You seem cooler.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.  I'm thinking about going to
			Morocco.

					DARRYL
			Lemme know if you need a little help
			with your Mom.

					WILLIAM
			A little might not be enough.

					DARRYL
			She still freaks me out.

					WILLIAM
				(nods, an old issue)
			Yeah -

					DARRYL
			She's famous.

					WILLIAM
			Listen -

					DARRYL
			Go ahead and do what you were doing.
			I just wanna hang in here for a moment.

					WILLIAM
			Cool.  Alright.

	William nods and continues his work, self-consciously, as Darryl
	sits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room.  A long
	moment passes.  Darryl pats his thighs, and rises.

					DARRYL
			Okay, man.

					WILLIAM
			Okay, man.

	34    INT. LIVING ROOM -- EVENING					34

	William slips on corduroy jacket, over a tie-dyed shirt.  Well,
	it's definitely a look.  Mom appears more nervous than her
	son.

					ELAINE
			I worry about the drunk drivers.

					WILLIAM
			Mom.  I'm 15.
				(beat, vague panic)
			Right?

					ELAINE
			Yes, you're 15. "And here's that money
			I owed you."

	She reaches in a small box near the door, gives him twenty
	bucks.  It's their routine.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Your dad's favorite joke.  I don't do
			it as well.

					WILLIAM
			I thought it was pretty good.

					ELAINE
			Keep the small bills on the outside.
			And call me if anyone gets drunk.

					WILLIAM
			I will call you if anyone
			anywhere gets drunk.

					ELAINE
			Good.

					WILLIAM
				(anticipating her, like a
			parent)
			And don't take drugs.

					ELAINE
				(stoic)
			Ha ha.  Very funny.  See -- sense of
			humor.  Have fun at the dance.  I'm
			glad you're making friends.

	They move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind
	her she's not going.  He opens the door.  She's a wreck, and
	she knows it.

					WILLIAM
			Mom?

					ELAINE
			Yeah -

					WILLIAM
				(loving but firm, as if to
			a dog.)
			Stay.

					ELAINE
			Oh... okay.

					WILLIAM
			I-love-you-bye.

	He opens the door.  Neil Young.  "Sugar Mountain."  Watching
	him leave is always a killer.  She's not getting any better at
	it either.  She folds her arms tightly across her chest.

	35    EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT					35

	Penny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different
	more elegant look.  She cups her hands and yells up to him.
	He hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost
	falling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin.

	36    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- LATER NIGHT				36

	Miss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset
	Boulevard.  She sings along to the obscure words of Led
	Zeppelin's "Dancing Days."  William takes it all in from the
	passenger seat.  Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or
	beer, but albums.  It's a wondrous piece of geography for any
	rock fan.  Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it all in.
	He moves his head outside the window to see fully.  Her
	windshield is cracked along the side.

					PENNY LANE
			The Continental Hyatt House.  Also known
			as The Riot House.
				(does tour guide voice)
			Every band stays here, all the ones
			that matter.  The Who.  Zeppelin.
			Alice.  Bowie.  English bands.  American
			bands.  We all know each other.  Twenty-
			four hour room service.  Like us, they
			were outsiders.  They were so outside,
			they're inside, and insiders never
			even knew it, because they're outsiders
			and they are inside a place outsiders
			will never be.  And why are we even
			talking about it?  If you're really an
			insider, you're never gonna say it.
			You know what I mean?

					WILLIAM
				(beat, working it out)
			Yeah.  Yes.

	She makes a swift turn into a secret parking spot near the
	hotel.

					PENNY
			And we're not gonna hang out with
			Russell.  You can, but not me.

					WILLIAM
			What is it with you and Russell?

	37    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT					37

	Neil Young and Crazy Horse's "Cinnamon Girl" ricochets across
	the Strip.  It's blasting from cars tuned into KMET.  Penny
	now wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat.  She grabs William's
	hand, steadying her hat at the same time.  They dart across
	the busy street.  She stumbles a little on her platforms.  He
	steadies his taller date.  They are a good team as they pass
	one of several humming tour busses parked out front.

	38    INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY -- NIGHT					38

	Penny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her
	arm.  The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive
	than most clubs.  It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying
	Halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling
	Rockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and
	taller-platforms than Penny Lane.  The feeling is communal,
	illicit, intoxicating.  The secret community of rock.  Penny
	attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.

					PENNY LANE
			It's all happening.
				(grabbing him like a shield)
			And I'm about to use you as protection.

					ROADIE # 1
			Penny Lane!!

					PENNY LANE
				(aside)
			These guys are with Alice Cooper.  I'm
			going to pretend I don't know them.

					ENGLISH ROADIE # 2
			Penny!!  Does Alice know you're here?

					PENNY LANE
			I'm just showing my very dear, very
			wonderful friend around.  He's a very
			important writer - he knows Lester
			Bangs.
				(English accent)
			I'm responsible for his moral conduct
			while he's abroad.

					ROADIE # 3
				(arriving, mock drama)
			Penny Lane!!   God's gift to rock and
			roll!!

					PENNY LANE
			I'm retired.
				(uses English accent)
			And don't argue with me!

					ROADIE # 3
			Again?

					PENNY LANE
				(moving, English accent)
			Have we met?

	Effortlessly touching an arm here and there, charming all -
	she had four men suddenly circling her.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			I've made a decision.  I'm going to go
			traveling in India.  Then I'm going to
			learn how to play the violin.  Then
			I'm going to go to college for one
			year.

	William looks at her, perplexed and a little hurt.  What about
	Morocco?

					ROADIE # 2
				(exiting, not buying it)
			There's nothing they could teach you
			in college, darling.
				(whispers)
			Call Alice.  He's under the name Bob
			Hope.

					ROADIE # 1
			I heard you were with Russell from
			Stillwater.

					PENNY
			Please.  I throw the little ones back.

	Lusty laughs circle William.  Overlapping this dialogue is the
	appearance of our friend Polexia.

					POLEXIA
				(in tears, in pieces,
			emotional)
			Ian Hunter is a fucking asshole!

					WILLIAM
			Polexia!

					POLEXIA
			Opie!!!

	She hugs him like a long-lost friend, knocking the air out of
	him.  And now overlapping this action, appears Superfan RIC
	NUNEZ, 14.  His eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal
	and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes.  Tonight he
	wears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters.
	It features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: "TO
	BE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL."  A felt-tip pen is still in his
	quivering hand.  Nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says:

					RIC
			It's all happening.   I just saw them
			on the seventh floor!  Mr. Jimmy Page...
			Mr. John Paul Jones...
				(displays squiggle on shirt)
			Mr. Robert Plant signed my shirt in
			the elevator!!  Five minutes ago, he
			touched this pen.  Please don't smear
			it.  And Bonzo's gotta new motorcycle
			in the hotel!

					PENNY
			Ric is a Zeppelin fan.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah, I picked that up.

					PENNY
			He tours with them, but not "with"
			them.

					RIC
			They're on the 12th floor, but there's
			guards there!  So you gotta go to the
			tenth floor and go up the back steps.

					PENNY LANE
			This is my very dear, very close, very
			wonderful friend William Miller, he is
			very close with Lester Bangs.

					RIC
			It's all happening!!  See you in
			Cleveland!

	Ric rushes back to the elevators.

					PENNY LANE
			I'm retired!  Doesn't anybody believe
			me!?

	39    INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY PHONE -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER		39

	Penny nearby as William picks up the house phone.  He shouts
	over the din.

					WILLIAM
			Harry Houdini, please.

	As he waits, he discreetly pockets the matches, hotel pad and
	pencil next to the housephone.

	40    INT. HALLWAY/RUSSELL'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT			40

	William, Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway,
	looking for the room.  William looks in the passing open doors,
	each one a different window into another world.

					PENNY LANE
			Okay.  Time to put on the lampshade.

	Up ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open.
	Inside, a band party in full swing.  A clunky early-model boom
	box segues from James Brown's "Make It Funky" to Led Zeppelin's
	"Gallows Pole."   Russell Hammond is the center of this party,
	jabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar.  Much singing
	echoes all around.  It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all
	members of the band are present.  Penny Lane takes a breath
	and enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite
	directions.  She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with
	proper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			"Ladies and Gentlemen.  Please
			extinguish all smoking materials and
			notice that the captain has turned on
			The No Smoking sign.  Your seat and
			tray tables should be locked in their
			full and upright positions."

					RUSSELL/OTHERS
			PENNY!!  PENNY LANE!!

	She is instantly and overwhelmingly, the life of this party.
	Russell joins William.

					RUSSELL
				(impressed to see him)
			Alright.

					WILLIAM
				(happy to be there)
			Alright.

	Russell places a beer in William's hands, and exits.

					PENNY LANE
				(continuing)
			"In the unlikely event of a water
			landing, the seat below you will serve
			as a -"
				(give up)
			Oh, the hell with it.

	They all applaud her, laughing.  William watches her with
	wonder, as she turns his way and winks.  Jeff approaches the
	alluring Polexia, and goes to get her a beer.  Meanwhile,
	Polexia sidles up to William.  She sees him watching Penny at
	the other side of the room.

					POLEXIA
				(privately)
			Act One, in which she pretends she
			doesn't care about him.

	POV shot travels to Russell, strumming the guitar that is always
	a part of his body.  Russell is watching Penny Lane
	surreptitiously.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Act Two, in which he pretends he doesn't
			care... and goes right for her.

	Russell moves towards Penny.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Act Three, in which it all plays out
			the way she planned it.  She'll eat
			him alive.

					WILLIAM
				(worried)
			We've got to stop them.

					POLEXIA
			Stop them?  You were her excuse for
			coming here.

	ON PENNY

					PENNY
			I need ice!

	Penny disappears out the door, across the hallway.  Russell
	follows a moment later.  The kid's eyebrows rise.  Polexia
	regards the kid with affection, adjusting his collar and peeling
	a hair off his jacket.

					POLEXIA
			I just worry about people using her.
			You know?  'Cause she brings out the
			good side in everybody else, but what
			do they do for her?  Life kills me.
			Do you have any pot?

					WILLIAM
			Not on me.

					POLEXIA
			Do you smoke?

					WILLIAM
			No.
				(attempting to fit in)
			But I... I grow it.  I grow it.

	Polexia looks at the kid, laughing at his poor job of lying.

					POLEXIA
			You're funny.  You know, if you were
			only taller, English, rich, a guitar-
			player and older...

					WILLIAM
			I'd be someone else.

					POLEXIA
			Yeah.  Good point.

	Jeff appears with her beer, and she whispers in the kid's ear
	before she exits with Jeff Bebe.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Bless me father for I may sin tonight.

	The kid watches, as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of
	Russell's, Eddie Giles' "Losin' Boy."  There is the sound of a
	motorcycle somewhere down the hallway.

	41    INT. ICE ROOM -- NIGHT						41

	The ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise.  Penny
	puts ice in her glass.  Behind her, Russell moves into frame,
	hands delicately riding the sides of her body.  A motorcycle
	roars by, just outside the door, as Penny moves away from
	Russell's exploring hands.

					PENNY
				(with real indignation)
			How does it end?

					RUSSELL
			What?

					PENNY
			You know - the story about the girl
			who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex
			wife -- the one we don't talk about --
			and gets a hundred... okay, five letters
			from him, and then doesn't even leave
			a pass in San Diego.  Wake up!  I'm
			retired and I never believed you anyway.
			You're too talented and too good-looking
			to be trusted and everybody knows it.

					RUSSELL
				(smiling, loves it)
			You're retired like Frank Sinatra is
			retired.

	She makes a scoffing noise.  He moves to the ice machine, with
	a glass of his own.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Miss Penny Lane.  Let me tell you what
			rock and Roll will miss the day you
			truly retire.

	He tosses cubes in his glass, one by one.  After the first cube:

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			The way you turn a hotel room into a
			home.
				(cube)
			The way you pick up strays wherever
			you go.  Like Pied Piper.
				(cube)
			The way you know the words to every
			song.  Every song.  Especially the bad
			ones.  Mostly the bad ones.
				(cube)
			That green coat in the middle of summer.
				(cube)
			The real name you won't reveal.
				(cube)
			And.  I'd keep going, but my glass if
			full.

					PENNY
				(quietly)
			Damn.

	He kisses her powerfully, hands at his sides.  She fights to
	keep her hands off him.  Bonham's motorcycle rips by, just
	outside the door.

					RUSSELL
			Come to Arizona.

					PENNY
			Never.

					RUSSELL
			We leave Thursday morning.  9 AM.  And
			pack light this time.  Jesus.

	They kiss.  The motorcycle speeds by again, just outside.

	42    INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT						42

	The hallways are crowded, as William looks at the closed door
	of the ice room.  He leans against the wall, alone now.  Trying
	to look like he belongs.  Behind him, most of the band has
	disappeared into other rooms, leaving only hangers-on in their
	places.

	43    INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY				43

	Music.  We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor.
	These are the San Francisco-based main offices of Rolling Stone
	Magazine.  We have arrived for the waning days that this
	magazine could still be called, with a straight-face, an
	"underground" publication.  Their mounting success crowds the
	edges of every frame.  Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz
	portraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon, Jagger, Rod Stewart,
	James Taylor.

	We find editor BEN FONG-TORRES, 29,  in his cramped cubicle.
	Sitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff
	writer, DAVID FELTON, 32, who smokes his cigarettes with a long
	holder.  Felton reads one of William's articles, chuckling.

					BEN FONG-TORRES
			William Miller?

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY

	William is on the phone in his own small room.

					WILLIAM
			This is he.

					BEN
			Crazy.  William, this is Ben Fong-
			Torres.  I'm the music editor at Rolling
			Stone Magazine.  We've got a copy of
			your stories from the San Diego Door.
			This is the same William Miller?

	William instantly, nervously alters his voice to sound older.

					WILLIAM
			Yes it is.

					BEN
				(rifling through tearsheets)
			Voice of God, howling dogs, the spirit
			of rock And roll... this is good solid
			stuff.

					WILLIAM
				(immediately, suddenly
			deeper)
			Thanks... thanks.

					BEN
			You should be writing for us.  Any
			ideas?

					WILLIAM
				(voice now to deep)
			How about Stillwater?

					BEN
			Crazy.  New album... their third...
			starting to do something.

	Ben shuffles through papers, looking for a tour itinerary on
	his promotional-material laden-desk, automatically plotting
	the piece aloud.

					BEN (cont'd)
				(pleasant, terse)
			Stillwater.  Hard-working band makes
			good.  Get 'em to respond to the critics
			who dismissed the first two albums as
			workmanlike. Guitarist is the clear star
			of the band.  Crazy.  Let's do three-
			thousand words.  You'll catch up to them
			on the road.  We'll set up billing --
			don't let the band pay for anything.

					WILLIAM
				(affecting casualness)
			Sounds good.

					BEN
			We can only pay -- lemme see, three-
			thousand words -- seven hundred dollars.

	The kid's eyes widen.

					BEN (cont'd)
			Alright, a grand.   What's your
			background?  You a journalism major?

					WILLIAM
				(deeply)
			Yes.

					BEN
			What college --

	INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

	Elaine now gets on the extension.

					ELAINE
			Honey, I need you to do that thing
			that fixes the garbage disposal --

	She hangs up.

	INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

	The kid is paralyzed.

					BEN
			Well, I know how my lady gets when I
			don't Snap to it -

					WILLIAM
			Crazy.

					BEN
			Crazy!  I'll let you go.  Call me at
			the San Francisco office tomorrow.

	44    INT. LESTER BANGS HOME -- LATE NIGHT				44

	The great Lester Bangs stands in the promotional album-clogged
	bedroom of his Birmingham, Michigan, home/office at Creem
	Magazine.  There is nothing in frame that does not deal with
	music.  In the background, a scratchy and chaotic Coltrane
	record.

					LESTER BANGS
			Beware Rolling Stone Magazine.  They
			will change your story, they'll re-
			write it and turn it into swill.
			Beware!!

					WILLIAM
			But besides that, what would be wrong
			with it?

					LESTER BANGS
				(laughs, entertained)
			You have starry eyes, my friend.
				(beat)
			Look.  Do the story.  It's a good break
			for ya.  But remember this --

	The kid listens intently, and makes notes.

					LESTER BANGS (cont'd)
			... don't do it to make friends with
			people who are trying to use you to
			further the big business desire to
			glorify worthless rock stars like
			Stillwater.  And don't let those swill
			merchants re-write you.

					WILLIAM
				(still copying)
			... swill merchants...

					LESTER BANGS
			Now.  What are you listening to?

	45    EXT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE -- DAY					45

	William knocks on the teacher's lounge door.  A Teacher answers,
	protective of their sanctuary.

					WILLIAM
				(urgently)
			I need to talk to Mrs. Deegan, from
			Journalism.

	Mrs. Deegan appears in the doorway.

	46    EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- LATE AFTERNOON				46

	The sun is still shining.  It's late afternoon, as Elaine Miller
	exits her car and arrives home.  She sees a few extra cars in
	the driveway, is immediately suspicious.

	47    INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON				47

	Elaine arrives to find William, Mrs. Deegan and Darryl awaiting
	her in the living room.  It's a 1973-style intervention.  They
	wear sunny, compassionate smiles.

					ELAINE
			Whatever it is, the answer is no.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Elaine, we need to talk to you.
			Nothing is wrong.  I am a teacher.
			You're a teacher.  We speak the same
			language.

	Mom sits down.  She is fully engaged and worried, her natural
	state.

					MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
			Now I'm not a jump-up-and-down person,
			but something wondrous has happened to
			William.  And you have every reason to
			be happy...
				(knows her)
			... and calm.

	Carefully gauging Elaine's face, the teacher continues.

					MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
			William has been gifted with a shining
			opportunity in the world of journalism.
			Through a love of music, and at an
			oddly-young age, he has received a major
			assignment from a national publication
			called Rolling Stone Magazine.

	Mrs. Deegan produces a copy, and places it on Elaine's lap.
	It sits there like the plague.

					MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
			Now you are rather famously not a fan
			of rock music, but such are the ironies
			of life, that happens to be the very
			topic of William's assignment -
				(cheerfully)
			- rock music.  A band.

					ELAINE
				(warily, to Darryl)
			Honey, what are you doing here?

					DARRYL
			Moral support.

	Mom looks evenly at her son, seated opposite her in this small
	living room.

					ELAINE
			What's involved?

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Well.  It's a great opportunity.  He'll
			be well-paid, and published nationally --
				(quickly)
			-- and he'll go on tour with a rock
			band for four days.  No small planes...
			he travels on a bus.

					ELAINE
			Is it time for me to say something?

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Sure.

					ELAINE
			No.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			And in anticipation of that response -

					ELAINE
			No.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			-- William has prepared --

					ELAINE
				(rueful)
			"Lo, that which I have feared has come
			upon me."

					WILLIAM
				(lightening fast)
			"He who jealously guards his fears,
			quietly yearns to bring them about!"

	Mrs. Deegan admires their high-strung intellectual parrying,
	makes an impressed noise.

					ELAINE
				(with compassion)
			No.  I have raised him to be an honor
			student, which he is.  We have agreed
			on all our goals.  We raised him to be
			a lawyer, we moved here to be near the
			finest law school in the West.  Plus,
			he has finals coming up, and in one
			week he graduates with all his friends
			-

					DARRYL
			He's got no friends!!

					WILLIAM
			Darryl.  Please.

	Nearby, having anticipated all of the above, William nods to
	Mrs. Deegan, and stands.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Elaine, may I present to you... your
			own son.

	William takes a lawyerly stroll, turns to face his mom.

					WILLIAM
			Lady of the Jury.
				(beat)
			I wish to disprove the prevailing false
			belief that rock music is based on drugs
			and sex.  True, perhaps at one time...
			but rock music is different now.  It is
			now performed by hard-working
			intellectuals, with... with blazing
			intellectual pursuits, and I am going to
			play for you a piece of music designed
			to show you that my thesis is correct.

					ELAINE
			This is going to be hell.

	Across the room, Darryl takes his position near the stereo.

					WILLIAM
			The song is based on the literature of
			Tolkien...  and it's mystical attempt
			to elevate humanity has been successful
			throughout the world...  this song
			will change your life.

	Mom stifles a cough.  William nods to Darryl, who reverentially
	drops the needle with a thud.  Mom is trapped, as we listen to
	silent static... and then... the opening notes of Led Zeppelin's
	"Stairway to Heaven."  William gives his Mother the album
	cover's inner-sleeve with lyrics.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			We ask you only to listen.

	Camera passes across their serious and expectant faces.  The
	intro in not short.  We listen, just watching their faces, as
	Elaine becomes increasingly impatient.

			ELAINE				WILLIAM
	  When is it going to start -   Soon.

	Immediately, overlapping, the vocal begins.  ("There's a lady
	who's sure all that glitters is gold.")

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	48    SUN MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY					48

	Sprinklers click across the lawns.  ("... and it makes me
	wonder... ")

	49    INT. LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON					49

	Mom adjust herself in the chair, listens politely, checks her
	watch.  She looks at William.

	50    EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON						50

	Sprinklers continue.  ("If there's a bustle in your hedgerow...
	")

	51    INT. LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON					51

	Mom listens fitfully.  The song continues.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	52    EXT. HOUSE -- STILL LATER AFTERNOON				52

	Sprinklers shut off.  Music is now blasting.  ("To be a rock,
	and not to roll... ")

	53    INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON				53

	Mom's face remains stoic to the bitter end.  ("... and she's
	buying the Stairway to Heaven.")  The song ends.  Silence.
	All look to Elaine.  They wait on her response.  We hear the
	turntable arm return to its cradle.

					ELAINE
			What am I supposed to say?   You say
			it's Tolkien, fine.  They sound like
			nice kids.  Is it meant to elevate
			humanity?  "Sure, let's elevate
			humanity.  After we sell you drugs and
			sex."  All I have is my honesty.  That's
			what I believe, and that's what I know.
				(flipping through magazine)
			Oh.  Here's a nice ad.

	She holds up the magazine.  And ad reads, in large bold type:
	BUY THIS FUCKING ALBUM.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			You've clearly ganged up on me, and I
			still say no.  No no no no no no no.

	She shuts her eyes, and blurts out something against her better
	judgement.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			NO MORE THAN FOUR DAYS AND I WANT A
 PHONE NUMBER FOR WHERE YOU ARE EVERY MINUTE AND I WANT YOU TO CALL ME TWICE A DAY AND YOU'D BETTER NOT MISS ONE 			TEST - AND NO DRUGS.

	William nods gratefully, and exits frame.  Hold on the empty
	chair, as drums herald the beginning of the Allman Brothers
	Band's "Trouble No More" from Live at Fillmore East.

	SHOT MOVES IN ON ELAINE

	who feels a very particular kind of loneliness.  It's the
	loneliness she got married, and then raised a family, to escape.

	54    INT. STILLWATER TOUR BUS -- DAY					54

	An empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle,
	taking us to William.  William picks up the bottle and places
	it in the seat back pocket in front of him.  He has joined the
	circus, and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and
	forbidding than he expected.  The bus struggles to make it up
	the hill, back rows shuddering loudly, as music continues.

					DICK
			C'mon, Doris!  Darling Bus.  You can
			make it!

	55    EXT. NEVADA DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY					55

	The Stillwater Tour Bus rumbles down the desert highway.  The
	destination banner reads - ALMOST FAMOUS -- TOUR 73.  Music
	continues.

	56    INT. BUS - DAY							 56

	William strains for a look at Russell five rows up.  He plays
	slide guitar, working out a part.   Next to Russell is Penny
	Lane.  Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash
	- takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe.

					PENNY
			Gotcha.

	Jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover.  Penny stuffs the
	shot in her pocket.  William watches, his private heart pounds.
	Polexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness.

					POLEXIA
			Do you have any pot?

					WILLIAM
			No.  I'm a journalist.

					POLEXIA
			Well, go do your job then.  You're on
			the road, man.  It's all happening!  Get
			in there.  Go talk to 'em!

	Challenged, William rises and approaches Russell.  He fixes
	the charismatic guitarist in his sights. Shot takes him down
	the aisle to the jamming star guitarist.  He crouches in the
	aisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody.  His
	mood is in the air.

					WILLIAM
				(very professional)
			Russell.   Do you think we might be
			able to find some time to talk when we
			get to Phoenix?  I want to interview
			everyone separately... and I felt we'd
			start with you and me.

	Nearby, Jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous.

					RUSSELL
			Absolutely.

	Russell turns away.  The kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle,
	babbling on.

					WILLIAM
			Because I've got a thing in a couple
			days.

					RUSSELL
			What.

					WILLIAM
				(self-conscious)
			It's a... thing where... uhm... you go
			there to graduate.  School.

					RUSSELL
				(sharply)
			I never graduated.  And look what
			happened.  You're here interviewing me.

	Good point.  Laughs from everybody listening nearby.  It's a
	good line.  William makes a quick jot in his notebook.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			No no no.  Don't put that in Rolling
			Stone.  My bio says I graduated.  We'll
			come up with something better later.
			Just enjoy the ride.

	Russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away.
	Penny notices William's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while
	grabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry.

					LARRY
			How did you know I was thirsty?

	He didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is.  He nods
	thanks to Penny, the perfect road companion for all.  And then
	Penny gives the other Coke, her Coke, to William.  He accepts
	it too, and starts back to his seat.  He's been blown off, and
	he knows it, but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and
	whispers in his ear:

					PENNY
			I may need to stay in your room tonight.
			Russell's in a bad mood.  He's very
			Bob Dylan in Don't Look Back today.
			He's trying to write.

	William nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his
	seat.  A large joint passes in front of him, across him, to
	Polexia, as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another
	hill.

					POLEXIA
				(inhaling deeply)
			Want some?

					WILLIAM
			No thanks.

	A wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face.  It
	surrounds him like a cloud.   The bus shudders, as Russell
	continues playing slide up ahead.

	57    INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				57

	Elaine sits in her living room, filled with her books.  Large
	Department store photos of her children on the wall.  She feels
	her own loneliness, and his too, as she dials a phone number.

					ELAINE
			Has William Miller arrived yet?  He
			hasn't.  Could you give him a message
			as soon as you see him? -

	58    INT. BUS -- NIGHT							58

	Several hours later on this ride.  Outside, night and desert.
	Inside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness
	of the bus.  The end of the Led Zeppelin classic "Whole Lotta
	Love" plays from the bus stereo, full blast.  Everybody is
	free and anonymous in the dark.  They sing at full-volume.
	William looks out the window in wonder.

					ZEPPELIN/ALL
			"Way down inside... (woman)
			woman...  you need... "

	The ten-ton guitar chord of Jimmy Page.

					ZEPPELIN/ALL (cont'd)
			"Loooooooooooooooooooooooovvve... "

	John Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still
	singing as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix.  William
	watches the living documentary around him.  He writes furiously
	in the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady
	his writing on the bumpy bus.  Behind him, someone is beating
	along to the song on his seat.  He never want to leave this world.

	59    INT. ARIZONA RAMADA INN LOBBY -- NIGHT				59

	All enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack.  The hotel chairs
	are spotted with curious hangers-on, decked out and lounging.
	Dick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk.   The
	sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick.  He
	is forever teaching others their jobs.

					DICK
			Jeff, Tony... Keys... keys... keys...
			room list...
				(re: luggage, to hotel
			bellman)
			If it doesn't have a number on it, it
			ain't ours!

	He gives key and a stack of messages to Russell, and turns to
	William who he makes feel more important.  Penny is nearby with
	her suitcase and tackle box purse.  William watches Russell's
	guitars whisked away - they are luggage-numbered 1, 3, and 4.

					DICK (cont'd)
			The Enemy!  Here you go, here's the key to
			your palatial suite, room list, plus let me
			give you a luggage tag.  You're Number 42.

					CLERK
			Is this Mr. Miller?  You have a message
			from Elaine.

					WILLIAM
			Thanks.

					CLERK
				(confidentially)
			She's a handful.

					WILLIAM
			I know.

	William cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it,
	and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen.
	Jeff exchanges a look with Russell.  Nearby, the walking
	commotion arrives, clacking through the lobby.  It's Sapphire.
	Last night's clothes are now today's.  She holds a travel case,
	and hanger with some odd blouses.

					SAPPHIRE
			Finally, you're here!!  They kicked me
			out of my room!  Fuck Ozzy!

	She hugs Penny Lane.  Estrella appears, happy to have help
	with Sapphire.

	ON RUSSELL

	who approaches William.

					RUSSELL
			Come by in a few minutes.  We'll do
			the interview.

	The kid exits and goes to join Penny, who is still comforting
	Sapphire.  Russell looks through his messages.  The guitar,
	now in a case, never leaves his hand.  Jeff Bebe approaches,
	regarding William standing with Penny and the girls.  Intrigue
	is swirling in the lobby.

					JEFF
			I'm worried, man.

					RUSSELL
			Naw, we can trust him.  He's a fan.

					JEFF
			But it's Rolling Stone.  He looks
			harmless, but he does represent the
			magazine that trashed Eric Clapton,
			broke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin,
			and wrote that lame story about the
			Allman Brothers Band that bummed Duane
			out before he died.  Don't forget the
			Rules.  This little shit is the Enemy.
			He writes what he sees.
				(beat)
			But it would be cool to be on the cover.

					RUSSELL
			Leave it to me.  We'll get a good story.

					JEFF
			Plus our girlfriends read this magazine
			and -
				(looking at Band-aids)
			-- you know.

					RUSSELL
			You made your point.  I'll take to
			him.

	ON WILLIAM BY ELEVATOR

	Penny speaks confidentially to him.  If she is slightly bossy,
	it is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and
	otherwise.

					PENNY
			Can Sapphire stay in your room tonight?
			She had a big fight with Ozzy, and
			Polexia's not working out with Jeff
			Bebe.
				(to Sapphire and Polexia)
			You just have to remember... these
			guys are jealous, insecure, talented,
			egocentric, and manipulative geniuses...
			they're lead-singers.   They can say
			"I love you" to 20,000 people... but
			any fewer is a real problem.
				(girls nod, comforted, she
			continues to the kid)
			Jeff Bebe has so much jealousy over
			Russell that he can't express.  Plus,
			he never slept last night.   You keep
			Sapphire and I'll stay with Russell.

	William covers his disappointment over losing Penny as a
	roommate.  Cooly:

					WILLIAM
			Sure.  I'll take her.

					POLEXIA
			Me too?

					WILLIAM
			Sure.

	Estrella arrives with travel bag, equally homeless, looking
	hopeful.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			If there's room -

	Penny squeezes him.  He feels cool... but the girl he really
	wanted to stay in his room now joins Russell, disappearing
	into the elevator.  He looks down at the message in his hand,
	and opens it.

	It reads: DON'T TAKE DRUGS!  He snaps it closed quickly, before
	anyone can see.

	59A   IN. RUSSELL's ROOM -- NIGHT						59A

	Russell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap.
	Trying to write.  It's coming slowly.  Shot moves off him,
	past a flickering television, onto Penny who silently and
	intently watches Russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird.
	He looks over at her - she turns away quickly.  He goes back
	to work.  Tries to catch her watching him again.  She turns
	away just in time.

	60    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT				60

	Stillwater's "Fever Dog" plays from the t.v. radio.   William
	on the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap.  His hotel
	room.  He watches self-consciously as the girls go about the
	ritual of inhabiting a room on the road.  Sapphire flutters a
	paisley scarf over the room lamp.  Polexia puts a towel along
	the crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too-
	many sticks of incense, and moves to the phone.  Estrella has
	joined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes.
	Instantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this,
	the smallest room in the hotel.   William thumbs through the
	phone book with fascination.

					WILLIAM
			All these people.
				(wondrous, off phone book)
			And they all live in Phoenix.

					POLEXIA
				(on phone)
			Hi Dad!!  I can't talk long!  I'm here in
			Paris.  I'm staying in another Youth Hostel
			with no phone and no address for mail!!

					WILLIAM
			(still wondrous, from phone
			 book)
			Alex.  Lowbatz.

					SAPPHIRE
				(emerging from bathroom)
			I was the one who told him what to
			tattoo on his fingers, I was the one
			who made his shirts... I was there
			when his wife left him.

					WILLIAM
			Charles.  C.  Swoop.

					POLEXIA
				(on phone)
			I CAN SEE THE EIFFELL TOWER.  DO YOU
			KNOW THERE ARE 578 STEPS TO THE TOP?

	She's reading from a European tour book.

					WILLIAM
			Paul and Debbie Finger.

					ESTRELLA
				(looking out window)
			Oh my God.  Simon Kirke of Bad Company
			is by the pool.

	The girls mobilize by the window.  William is increasingly
	aware that he is an outsider in his own tiny room.  He tries
	to organize his stuff in the corner.

					POLEXIA
			I GOTTA GO!  I'LL CALL FROM ROME!

					ESTRELLA
			Is anybody here as worried about Penny
			and Russell as I am?

					POLEXIA
				(the perfect daughter)
			AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MAGGIE!!
			I LOVE YOU!!

	She winks at William, who looks away.

					SAPPHIRE
				(to Polexia and William)
			Ooo, watch out - whoever you look at
			when you say that - that's who you
			really mean.

	Polexia hands up and throws a pillow at Sapphire,  the kid
	watches these girls like a tennis match.

	60A   IN. PENNY AND RUSSELL'S ROOM - SAME TIME				60A

	Russell puts down his guitar.

					RUSSELL
			You know.  We should talk about what
			we don't talk about.

					PENNY
			We don't have to.

					RUSSELL
			No, I - I went to Catholic school.  I
			believe in guilt and... you know, if
			there's any to be had, I pretty much
			want to roll around in it.

					PENNY
			I don't believe in attachments.  No
			boundaries.  Just the music.

					RUSSELL
			I'm just saying, it's okay to talk
			about it.

	Penny stands and turns.  She speaks the word.

					PENNY
			Leslie.

	Russell nods.  The name is out in the open.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.

					RUSSELL
				(somehow satisfied)
			Alright - now we're talking.

	But she continues, saying the name in a multitude of different
	ways, in different accents, and with different degrees of
	indifference and passion and lust and play-acting and mock-
	drama.

	PUSH IN ON HIS FACE

	As he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning.
	Is she mocking him?   In love with him?  Taunting him?  Seducing
	him?

					PENNY
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Lesssssslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			LESlie.  Leslie...

	She continues saying it until it no longer has meaning.  And
	finally she sits next to him.

					PENNY (cont'd)
				(beat)
			Now.  Have I helped you get that off
			your chest?

	They kiss.

	60B   INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME				60B

	The girls continue their settling-in process.

					SAPPHIRE
			Opie, can I order room service?

	The nickname "Opie" re-opens a nagging wound.  Polexia hangs
	up, and begins to dial again.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.  You guys.  Wait.   Put down the
			phone, Polexia.
				(she does, sadly)
			First, this is my room...

					SAPPHIRE
			Come on, you're a fan like us.  You're
			on our side of the line.

					WILLIAM
			Second.  I'm not Opie.  Alright?  Opie
			is a little boy.  I'm here to do a
			job.  I am a professional.

					ESTRELLA
				(flipping luggage tag)
			Ooooooo, sorry, Mr. 42.

					WILLIAM
			Third!
				(has their attention now)
			... this phone is a big, big deal.  In
			a minute, I have to go interview
			Russell.  Do not answer this phone if it
			rings.  I have family members with
			severe anxiety Problems.  She will not
			understand.

					POLEXIA
				(wounded)
			But what if Ozzy calls Sapphire?   And
			I gave Jimmy Page this number.

					ESTRELLA
			Or a guy who looked like Jimmy Page.

	William looks at their troubled faces, full of too much-longing
	and too much make-up.

					WILLIAM
			Okay.   I have a solution.  Answer the
			phone.  But if anyone without an English
			accent is on the phone...
				(winging it)
			Just hang up.  Or say it's the wrong
			room.

	They nod.  It's a good plan.

	61    EXT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT						 61

	The hanging sign on the door reads: DO NOT DISTURB. William
	knocks on Russell's door. A maid pushes up against him with
	her cart, which now blocks the hallway.

					WILLIAM
			SHOULD I COME BY LATER?

	A group of golf conventioneers are now trapped behind the maid
	cart.  They ease past William as he negotiates with Russell
	through the door.

					RUSSELL (O.S.)
			 YES, I'M IN TOO TRUTHFUL A MOOD!

					WILLIAM
			MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING!!

					RUSSELL (O.S.)
			I'LL SEE YOU AT THE RADIO INTERVIEW
			LATER!!  TEN-THIRTY IN THE LOBBY.

					WILLIAM
			OKAY!

					RUSSELL
			GO AWAY!

					WILLIAM
			OKAY!

	We hear Penny's giggle.  Then the door opens, and it's Penny
	looking ravishing.  In the background, Russell sits shirtless
	at the table.  He playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up
	wads of hotel stationery.

					PENNY
			Don't worry.  Some to the radio
			interview.

					WILLIAM
			No, I'm fine.  I'll just interview
			Jeff Bebe some more.

					RUSSELL
				(as in "you're on of us")
			GO AWAY!

	She shuts the door quickly.  It hurts a little.  He picks up
	the wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket.  He
	leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and
	matches from the nearby maid's cart.  Then he returns to
	Russell's door.  He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds
	of laughter, just for a moment, escalating.  He flips the sign
	over: HOUSEKEEPING PLEASE ENTER - CLEAN ROOM.

	62    INT. OUTER RADIO STATION - NIGHT					62

	Humble Pie.  "Thirty Days in the Hole."  Russell and band enter
	the radio station, passing through the now-empty front office.
	As always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good.
	Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles,
	as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold
	records  and head down the small hallway to the control room
	interview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her
	green coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a
	little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will
	have none of it.  She privately shares every great passing
	moment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms.
	It's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own "Fever Dog."

	63    INT. RADIO CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT					63

	Stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone
	in this room.  Russell takes a seat near the open mike.  Jeff
	Bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be
	just as close to the microphone as Russell.  William watches
	all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth.
	Stillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE
	ALLEN, 25.

	Quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it.
	The entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and
	ready for the interview.   William can't avoid looking at Penny
	Lane, who looks great tonight.  She catches him, and he barely
	looks away in time.  Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff,
	notices.  The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the
	microphone, as the finale of "Fever Dog" is just ending.

					QUINCE ALLEN
			The guitar of Russell Hammond.   "Fever
			Dog"...  The band is Stillwater.
				(beat)
			Watch with your mind as they
			materialize.

	Band members gets closer to the microphone, preparing to speak.
	Quince lowers his head, shutting his eyes and getting into the
	music as the song plays out.

	64    INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						64

	The phone rings.  Estrella answers.

					ESTRELLA
			William's room.

	INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICE -- NIGHT

	Ben Fong-Torres is calling from Rolling Stone.

					BEN
			Can I please speak to him?  This is
			Ben Fong-Torres at Rolling Stone.

	Estrella panics,  hangs up quickly, as if the phone has just
	caught fire.

					ESTRELLA
			I think I just messed up!

	65    INT. RADIO STATION -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME				65

	Quince raises his head and continues on-the-air.  The same
	song is still ending.

					QUINCE
			Look at the dogs, wearing the funny
			hats.  Juggling just for you.  Freaks
			and family...

	Penny shoots William a look.   Do you believe this guy?

					QUINCE (cont'd)
			It's Quince, with Stillwater.  Here.
			Live.  It's the Night Circus.

	The band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk.  Quince
	continues, looking meaningfully at the band.  They are
	waiting... eager for a chance to speak.

					QUINCE (cont'd)
			Every minute a baby is born somewhere..
			Life.  Death.  Hermetically sealed
			bags of human emotion.  Bags of love...
			bags of kindness?
				(suddenly, turns)
			How'd you get together?

	As Jeff eagerly speaks, Quince lowers his head and listens...
	feels... the words of his guests.

					JEFF
			Well... not to get into a "me" thing...
			this is Jeff talking... but I did start
			the band, some time, actually, ago.
			This is back when we were the Jeff
			Bebe band, and I placed an ad in a
			magazine called Peaches looking for a
			guitarist and Russell Hammond answered.

	Quince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly.

					QUINCE
				(with deep understanding)
			Peaches.

	Jeff watches Quince's head lower.  It's hard to know when to
	talk with Quince.  The depth of his mellowness is tough to get
	in rhythm with.

					JEFF
			I think he was a gift from God,
			actually.  Nobody plays like Russell
			Hammond.

					RUSSELL
				(sorta moved)
			Well, shit.  Thank you.

	He instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Ooops.  Better hit the delay button.

	All eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to
	some inner beat.  He says nothing.  The band looks at each
	other.  We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be
	asleep.  Long silence.  William shares an amazed look with
	Penny.  Quince is definitely asleep.  Russell leans forward
	and continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Okay - we're talking now, right?  Why
			the fuck do you wait until and interview
			in Arizona to say something nice about
			me.  Why don't you say it to my fucking
			face sometime?  Because I tell you
			every time I think you nailed something.

					JEFF
			Everybody pays you compliments.  It's
			not my fucking job to kiss your fucking
			ass all the time.

					RUSSELL
			Well then who's fucking job is it?
			Because my ass is dying for a kiss.
			And I know yours is too.

					DICK
			It's my fucking job.  You're all
			geniuses.  And let me just add this
			thought - smegma.

	Penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to William.
	He offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room.
	William shares a look.  Quince is still deeply asleep, as the
	usually quiet tony leans forward to speak.

					TONY
			Feces.

	He cracks himself up, silently.  Quince snaps awake, fully in-
	stride.

					QUINCE
			The dong is called "Love Thing." Your
			mind is Starting to take effect.
			They're all here to see you swallow
			fire.  You scream soundlessly...  on the
			Night Circus.  It's Quince, with
			Stillwater.

	"Love Thing" takes over, as Quince swivels in the chair.

					QUINCE (cont'd)
			I thought that went well.

	66    INT. RENTAL CAR -- NIGHT						 66

	Adrenalized laughter.  The whole band is crammed into a medium-
	sized rental car.  Penny half on William's lap, half on
	Russell's.

					RUSSELL
				(to William)
			See, this is what nobody writes about!
			The in-between times!   This!  Us!
			Right now!!

	67    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM						67

	The phone is ringing.  Estrella emerges from the bathroom with
	no make-up and a t-shirt.  She picks up the phone.  Across the
	room, Sapphire signs for room service.  Now she is far too
	made-up.  The t.v. radio plays Free's "Fire and Water" in the
	b.g.

					ESTRELLA
				(suspiciously)
			Hello?

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

	It's Mom on the phone.

					ELAINE
				(measured, very proper)
			May I speak with William please?

					ESTRELLA
				(cheerfully)
			He's not here.  I think he's in the
			bar with the Band.  They just got back
			from the radio station.  Is this Maryann
			with the pot?

	Silence.

					ESTRELLA (cont'd)
			Hello?

					ELAINE
			No this isn't Maryann with the pot.
			This is Elaine... his Mother.

	Estrella physically recoils.

					ESTRELLA
				(cringing)
			I thought you were English.

					ELAINE
			Could you please give him a message?
			Could you tell him to call home
			immediately?  And could you also tell
			him -
				(at full power)
			I know what's going on.

					ESTRELLA
			Alright.  Okay.  But I'm just going to
			say this, and I'm going to stand by
			it.
				(can't help herself)
			You should be really proud of him.
			'Cause I know guys... and I'll bet you
			do too.  And he respects women, and he
			likes women, and let's just pause and
			appreciate a man like that.   You
			created him out of thin air, and you
			raised him right, and we're all looking
			out for him.  And that's more than
			I've ever said to my own parents, so
			there you go.
				(silence)
			This is the maid speaking, by the way.

	68    INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT						68

	Russell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in
	the hotel lobby.  William shuffles through many pages of
	questions written in small script.  His tape recorder microphone
	sits balanced on the chair.

					WILLIAM
				(very professional)
			Now that you're starting to be
			successful, you had twenty-six years
			to write your first Album... and you'll
			have maybe four months for the second.
			Do you worry that the pressure of the
			business will get in the way of the
			original joy of making your music?  Or
			-

	Russell blinks.  The all-consuming issues of his life are right
	in front of him.

					RUSSELL
			Whoa!
				(laughing)
			I need three more beers and my guitar
			before I can answer that question.
			Let's take a walk.

	69    EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - NIGHT					69

	Russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William.
	William follows him through the sliding glass door to his room,
	facing the pool.  Russell grabs his guitar.  They stand for a
	moment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait
	twenty yards in front of them.  The off-limits after-hours
	pool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members.
	Jeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby.  Dick laughs at a joke.
	Always the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels
	from a maid cart.  And she is the first to slip into the pool
	for some after-hours, against-the-rules swimming.  Effortlessly,
	she turns a collection of people into a party.  They regard
	her, well out of earshot of the others.

					RUSSELL
			For a minute I thought you were actually
			a real journalist... which is... you
			know, it's great.
				(beat)
			Shut that thing off, and I'll tell you
			the truth.

	William shuts his tape recorder off.

					WILLIAM
			It's off.

					RUSSELL
			Look.  I trust you.  I'm going to lay
			this right on you.  Just make us look
			cool.

					WILLIAM
			I will quote you warmly and accurately.

					RUSSELL
			That's what I'm worried about.  See -
			some of us have girlfriends back home.
			Some of us have wives.  And... some of
			the people you meet on the road are
			really amazing people...

	They both watch Penny Lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool.
	She places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting
	all, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Like you.  And some of the things that
			happen are good for just a few people
			to know about - as opposed to, say, a
			million people.

	Dawn is breaking for William.

					WILLIAM
			Ohhhh.  Oh.  Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			You know what I mean?

					WILLIAM
			Right.  Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			See, you're dangerous.  Most people
			are just waiting to talk, but you
			listen.

					WILLIAM
			Right.  Right.

					RUSSELL
			So your question you asked me.  I think
			about It every fucking night.  The
			"business."  I hate it!
				(quietly)
			I grew up with these guys, okay?  I
			can't play all that I can play, I'm
			past these musicians, do you understand?

					WILLIAM
			I do.

					RUSSELL
			The more popular we get, the more I
			can't walk on them, the bigger their
			houses get, the more pressure... you
			forget, man.  You forget what it was
			like to be real, to be a fan.  You can
			hear it in a lot of bands who've been
			successful - it doesn't sound like
			music anymore.  It sounds like...
			like lifestyle maintenance.
				(suddenly confessional)
			I used to be able to hear the sounds
			of the world.  Everything, to me, used
			to sound like music.  Everything.  Now
			I don't hear it.   You know what I'm
			trying to say?

					WILLIAM
				(ruefully)
			Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			Man, it feels good to say this stuff
			out loud.  But what am I doing?  I'm
			telling secrets to the one guy you
			don't tell secrets to.

					WILLIAM
				(feeling included)
			No, that's okay.  We'll do the interview
			tomorrow.

					RUSSELL
			This is good.  So there's the "friend"
			and then there's the "interview guy."

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					RUSSELL
			So tonight it's "friend".... and when
			we wake up tomorrow - "interview guy."
			We'll figure it out as we go, buddy.

					WILLIAM
			Hey - for whatever it's worth - you
			guys are really good.

	Russell laughs at the kid's easy naivete.  He hands his guitar
	to the kid, and joins the party.  William watches, part of the
	crowd... somehow feeling a little compromised.  He doesn't
	care.  Penny gestures for him to join them.

	70    EXT. SUN STADIUM - AFTERNOON					70

	William interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena.  On
	stage, Ed soundchecks his drums.

					WILLIAM
			How would you describe your role in
			Stillwater?  What is the chemical that
			you add to the chemistry?

					LARRY
			I'm the bass-player.

					WILLIAM
				(pressing for some poetry)
			Right.  And when you take that away...
			what would be missing?  Stylistically?
			What chemical?

					LARRY
				(not getting it)
			The bass?

	Larry doesn't give him much.

	71    EXT. SUN STADIUM - NIGHT						 71

	It's raining.  The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part
	of them.  Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look.  She takes the scarf
	from around his neck and ties it around his leg.  He looks
	instantly better.  William watches in the darkness as Dick
	takes the microphone.  The best part of his day has arrived.
	In his important voice:

					DICK
			Good evening Phoenix.
				(applause)
			From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome,
			Stillwater.

	Lights come up, as the band launches into "Fever Dog."   Jeff
	begins singing.  Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for
	a back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected.

	A sharp electrical shock.

	It's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a
	moment something is clearly wrong.  Russell holds onto the
	microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage
	for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal.  His
	face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage,
	collapsing a couple steps later.

	72    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT						72

	Dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has
	been pulled up into the backstage area.   He guides a sagging
	Russell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus.

					DICK
			Get in, get in!!

	William boards the bus, as the extremely agitated PROMOTER
	arrives to confront Dick.

					PROMOTER
			Are you the manager of this band?

					DICK
			That, and more.  Get in!

					PROMOTER
			You didn't even play a full set!

	Dick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing
	with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand.

					DICK
			Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed
			our guitarist!

					PROMOTER
			You trashed the dressing room - you
			didn't play your thirty-five minutes.
			You didn't fulfill your contract -

					DICK
			Everybody in!  Get in the bus!

					PROMOTER
			I'll report you to every promoter in
			the country!  I'm gonna talk to Frank
			Barcelona!

					DICK
			YOU DON'T FUCK WITH MY BAND'S SAFETY!

					PROMOTER
			I hope you have a good lawyer.

					DICK
			I AM A LAWYER!

	He swings into the bus, as the bus revs.

					PROMOTER
			LOCK THE GATE ON 'EM!

	73    INT. BUS -- NIGHT							73

	Russell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus.  He
	examines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the
	positivity of her words.

					PENNY
			Don't worry.  It's happened to all the
			greats.  Thank God you didn't hold the
			mike stand with both hands, you'd still
			be holding it.  This is a good thing.
			It's a good, good, good thing.

	William sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye-
	sight of others.  The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes
	to see that he's writing in his notebook.

	Dick swings into the seat across from Russell.  The bus door
	shuts, as the promoter is still yelling.

	Doris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running
	alongside.  She knocks on the window next to William.

					ESTRELLA
			I forgot to tell you!  Your mom says
			to call home immediately.  She says
			she knows what's going on!
				(receding)
			See you guys in Topeka!  I'll catch a
			ride with Sabbath!

	William nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races
	toward the now closing gate.

					DICK
				(casually, to Russell)
			Wanna buy a gate?

	Before Russell can answer - BASH.  Doris barrels through the
	steel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside
	this bus.

					DICK (cont'd)
			You just bought a gate.
				(to the bus)
			C'mon Doris!!  Get us out of town!!

	The bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for
	Doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a
	thoroughfare.

					WILLIAM
			What did it feel like to be
			electrocuted?

					RUSSELL
			It burns.  It feels like a dose of
			lead shooting through your body... and
			then you see God, and he says, "How
			bad do you want to be legendary?" And
			god damnit.  I let go.
				(shaky grin as all laugh
			warmly)
			Rock and roll.

	Jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy.  The kid
	scribbles in his notebook.  We hear Led Zeppelin's "That's the
	Way."

	74    INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING						74

	Song continues.  Almost everybody is asleep.  William takes
	the camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny.  She wakes
	up.

					PENNY
			Give that to me.

	She grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight.  He grabs some
	other Polaroids from her pocket.  He hustles to the back of
	the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the
	passing landscapes.  She chases him down the aisle.  Music
	continues as she sits down next to him.  Out the window, a
	long-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus
	for a bit.  They wave.  Penny watches them over sunglasses,
	waves briefly to the real world.

					PENNY (cont'd)
				(breathing heavy, owning
			the world)
			When we go to Morocco, I think we should
			wear completely different clothes, and
			be completely different people.

					WILLIAM
			What will our names be?

	She snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets
	the Polaroid.  She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping.
	Her attention has already wandered from Morocco.

					PENNY
			What do you think of Russell?

					WILLIAM
			I like him.

					PENNY
			You're coming to Cleveland, right?

					WILLIAM
			Cleveland, Ohio?  Oh no no no.  I gotta
			get my interview with Russell before
			Greenville.  And you've got to help
			me.  Okay?  Friends... remember?

	Penny is still watching Russell.

					PENNY
			You should give him a break.  There
			are real problems in the band.   Off
			the record.

	Gravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins Penny in
	watching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping
	restlessly up ahead.

					WILLIAM
			What problems?

					PENNY
			Okay.  I got it.  I think your name
			should be Spencer, and mine will be
			Jane.

					WILLIAM
			I can't keep up with you.

					PENNY
			No one can.

					WILLIAM
			What's your real name?

	She looks at him briefly.  She puts her arm around him.  It's
	intoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act.  With her
	free hand, she gestures with a hanger.  As they regard Russell
	sleeping nearby:

					PENNY
			Here's the thing about Russell.  He's
			my last project.  I only do this for a
			very few people.  And I think we should
			do it together - he is almost great.
			We've got to take him there.  You and
			me - we can do it.  Deal?  Because the
			other guys are good - but he could be
			great.  He's my last project.

	He looks at her.  She imitates his face back to him.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			It's all happening.

	75    INT. TOPEKA ARENA BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT				75

	William sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases.

					WILLIAM
			What do you love about music?

	Ed looks at him thoughtfully.  It is an eloquent moment.  He
	thinks.  He shrugs.  The kid tumbles with more questions.
	These interviews are not going well.

	76    INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT						76

	William, looking concerned over the state of his interviews,
	walks into the backstage bathroom.  He makes a few surreptitious
	notes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing
	there, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered
	by a Local Hanger-On.  Seeing the kid, he immediately hides
	the coke spoon.

					JEFF
			Hey.

					WILLIAM
			Hey.

	William pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal,
	and shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little
	worried.

	77    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT					77

	William is on the pay phone with his Mother.  The show booms
	in the background.

					WILLIAM
			I know.  I know.  I know.
				(beat)
			I know.  Mom.  Mom... Mom.

	78    INT. STAGE - NIGHT						78

	Stillwater on-stage.  A great show.  Russell on fire.

	79    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT					79

	William on the phone.  Estrella leans on him, fixing her shoe.

					WILLIAM
			Right now -- Topeka.  Then Greenville.
			Then home.

	He winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a
	moment.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			I'm sorry I didn't call yesterday!
			It's not like you can just carry a
			phone around with you.

	80    INT. ELAINE'S SCHOOL OFFICE -- AFTERNOON				80

	Mom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home
	- a fortress in which she is surrounded by books.  The sun is
	going down.  She can't resist a sentimental moment.

					ELAINE
			I guess I just miss you, and I don't
			understand why I've driven both my
			kids so far away from me.  By all
			practical rules don't I get you for
			three more years?

	He is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever,
	as music continues in b.g.

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			Was I not fun?

	81    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE -- NIGHT					81

	William has his finger in his ear.  The din if Stillwater's
	set now blots out all other noise.  It is not the time to answer
	this question.

					WILLIAM
			I missed the last thing you said.

	Mom takes a pause.

					ELAINE
			I LOVE YOU.

	Penny now enters, watching.

					WILLIAM
			WHAT?

					ELAINE
				(angry, louder)
			I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU!

	William now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad
	from a paper dish.  Looking at her, he lets loose with what he
	believes is a private confession.

					WILLIAM
			I LOVE YOU!!

	Penny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another
	backstage pass, and turns away.  Camera stays on William.  He
	is suddenly and deeply embarrassed.  He's just told her that
	he loves her and she knows it.  He hangs up, traumatized.

	82    INT. TOPEKA DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT				82

	Russell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished.
	He is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders.   Luggage
	for the next city is stacked by the door.

					RUSSELL
			Fire away.  I'm ready.  I'm on the
			"You" Train.  Take me there.

	The kid plugs in his microphone.  Russell listens as he springs
	his first question.

					WILLIAM
			Do you have to be depressed to write a
			sad song?  Do you have to be in love
			to write a love song?  Is a song better
			if it really happened to you?  Like,
			"If You Say Nothing"... where did you
			write that and how did it come about?

	Russell admires the many questions.  Says nothing.  He looks
	at his hand, thinks.

					RUSSELL
			When did you get so professional?

	In the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt.
	Grinning, she cuffs his shoulder.  To the shirtless silent
	drummer, waiting for his shirt.

					PENNY
			I'm almost done with my shirt.

	Ed watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber
	pad.  Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap.  In
	the corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being
	underappreciated.  And now Dick enters with a large cardboard
	box.

					DICK
			Russell, your dad showed up again.
			And on a lighter note.
				(importantly)
			Gentlemen.  Your first t-shirts have
			arrived.

	There is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the
	box filled with new white t-shirts.  He untangles the first fresh
	shirt, and displays it proudly.  A silent beat as all examine it -
	their first t-shirt.  Faces fall.  Ed stops drumming.  There has
	been a mistake.  It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name
	emblazoned below.  Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored-
	in and emphasized on the shirt.  He turns away, making a noise.
	Jeff stares at the t-shirt.  He's just about in tears.  There is
	a long silence and then... Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.

					DICK (cont'd)
			It's the record company's mistake.
			And they will pay.  Shirts gone, band
			happy.

	He drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were
	contaminated, and exits with the box.  William watches as the
	two men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room.
	Russell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff.  The vibe is thick.
	Russel turns to see Jeff staring at him.

					RUSSELL
			Can we just skip the vibe and go
			straight to us laughing about this?

					JEFF
				(bitterly)
			Yeah.  Okay.

					RUSSELL
				(trying for a joke)
			Because I can see by your face - you
			want to get into this -

					JEFF
			How can you tell?  I'm just one of the
			out-of-focus guys.

					RUSSELL
			Here we go.

	William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Here.  Take it.  You LOVE this shirt -
			it lets you say everything you want to
			say.

					JEFF
			Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.

					RUSSELL
			It's a t-shirt.

	Russell turns away.

					JEFF
			I'm always gonna tell you the truth.

					RUSSELL
			Are you doing coke again?

					JEFF
			Oh yeah.  All the time.

	The kid looks down.

					JEFF (cont'd)
			This is big stuff, man.  From the very
			beginning -- we said -- I'm the front
			man and you're the guitarist with
			mystique.  That's the dynamic we agreed
			on -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith.  But
			somehow it's all turning around.  We
			have got to control what's happening
			to us.  There's a responsibility here -

					RUSSELL
			Excuse me, but didn't we all get into
			this to avoid responsibility?

					JEFF
			Forgive me.
				(continuing, on shirt)
			But this is the slow-moving train of
			compromise that will kill us.

	Russell makes a disgusted noise.  Penny Lane exits discreetly,
	looking back at William.

					JEFF (cont'd)
			I can't say anymore with a writer here.

					RUSSELL
			You can trust him,  you can say whatever
			you want.

					JEFF
				(eyes suddenly moist)
			I works as hard or harder than anybody
			on that stage.  You know what I do - I
			connect.  I get people off.  I look
			for the guy who isn't getting off, and
			I make him get off.
				(beat)
			Actually, that you can print.
				(continues to Russell)
			And yet, why do I always end up feeling
			like I'm a joke to you?  I feel nothing
			but love for you.  We're a family.

	He looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry.  Embarrassed, he
	grows angrier.

					JEFF (cont'd)
			You want to pretend this isn't going
			to be a very big band.  Well it is.  You
			call yourself a leader of this band, but
			your direction allowed the t-shirt, when
			you allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause
			he's your friend... don't you see?  The
			t-shirt is everything.  It's everything.

					RUSSELL
			Is it my turn?  Because I think we
			should, for once, say what we really
			mean.

					JEFF
			Oh, this is the part where you quit -

					RUSSELL
				(stiffening)
			Right.  I'm so predictable.

					JEFF
			No  I gotta tell the truth -- I want
			you to like me.  But sometimes I feel
			like you collect people who love you
			and then very skillfully... you make
			them feel bad that they're not good
			enough for you.

					RUSSELL
			Stick to singing, brother, 'cause you
			ain't gonna make it as a shrink.

					JEFF
			Deal with it!  And let me just say
			what nobody Else wants to say to you -

					RUSSELL
			What?

					JEFF
			Your looks have become a problem.

	82A   EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT						 82A

	Russell walks swiftly past a happy silver-haired man, who holds
	court with beer in hand.  He dresses too young for his age,
	late fifties.  He is DAD.

					DAD
			Son!

					RUSSELL
				(dutifully)
			Hello Harry.

	Dad introduces a woman much younger, who eyes Russell hungrily.

					DAD
			He got all the good genes, huh?  Meet
			Deirdre.  We're getting married in
			July.

	83    EXT. ARENA -- NIGHT						83

	Russell walks fast outside the arena.  William hustles to catch
	up.  The two men walk in long silent strides in the cold night
	air, beyond the backstage area.  Fans begin to recognize and
	follow at a discreet distance.

					WILLIAM
			You okay?  You alright?

	Russell doesn't answer.

					RUSSELL
				(resolute, wound up)
			From here on out, I'm only interested
			in what's real.

	The kid nods.  They walk.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Real feelings.  Real people.  That's
			all I'm interested in...  From here on
			out.  What is REAL?   You're real.

					WILLIAM
			Thanks.

	A wave of warmth comes over Russell.

					RUSSELL
			You know, you know all about us and I
			don't know shit about you.
				(struggling to be personal)
			What's your... your family like?  Tell
			me.

					WILLIAM
			Well, my dad died of a heart attack
			and my sister believes that my Mom is
			so intense that she might have
			contributed to it.  Plus -

					RUSSELL
				(immediately)
			Okay, that's good.  That's enough.

					WILLIAM
			It's good to talk about it.  Really
			good.

	Russel now sees some hero worship in the kid's face, and it
	makes him nervous.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			Hey, man, maybe we should go back.

					RUSSELL
			If they want me, they can find me.

	William turns and sees nobody following but fans.

					WILLIAM
			So listen.  I have to go home tomorrow.
			I know this is a bad time to finish
			our interview.

					RUSSELL
			Hey, man, you know what?  Write whatever
			you want.  I trust you.

	A big square Chevy van slows down.  A CONCERT-GOER hands his
	head out the window.

					CONCERT-GOER
				(battle-cry)
			Woooooooooo!!!  You're Russel from
			Stillwater!!

					RUSSELL
			On my better days, yes.  I am "Woooooo,
			Russell from Stillwater!"

					CONCERT-GOER
			Wanna go to a party at my friend Aaron's
			house?!  I know you're a big rock star,
			but do you want to hang with some people
			looking to have a good time?

	Russel regards the van full of kids.  More fans crowding
	around.  The kid behind the wheel unknowingly says the magic
	words.

					CONCERT-GOER (cont'd)
			We're just real Topeka people, man.

	He has said the magic word.

	A84   EXT. AARON'S PARTY - NIGHT					A84

	Russell arrives at the party in the rural outskirts of Topeka.
	William nearby.

	84    INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT					84

	William watches as Russell slugs from a Jack Daniels bottle.
	They sit in the bedroom of a mindblown fan, 17 year-old AARON.
	He has long frizzy brown hair, tied in a spray behind him.
	Many from the neighborhood are now pouring into the home.

					RUSSELL
				(eyes glowing)
			You.  Aaron.  Are what it's all about.
			You are real.  Your room is real.
			Your friends are real.  You are more
			important than... than... all the silly
			machinery.  And you know it!  In eleven
			years it's gonna be 1984, man.  Think
			about that!

					AARON
			Wanna see me feed a mouse to my snake?

					RUSSELL
			Yes.

					KID # 1
			Can I have your belt?

					RUSSELL
			Take it!

	Russel whips off his belt, gives it to the fan.  A joint goes
	by, headed for Russell.  William intercepts it and passes it
	on.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Aaron?  Where's your bathroom?  I want
			to live here. I want to eat your food,
			and live in your city and fuckin rock
			like I used to.  I want to learn
			everything there is to know about your
			city and your town.  And your way of
			being real.
				(stunning realization)
			I used to be you.

					AARON
			Down the hall by the washing machine.

					RUSSELL
			What?

					AARON
			The bathroom.

					RUSSELL
			Okay.  Good to know.

	Russell rises and squeezes past fans and heads down the hall.

	85    INT. AARON'S HALLWAY - NIGHT					85

	William follows Russell protectively.

					PASSING FAN # 1
			WOOOOOOO!!

	A QUIET GIRL, 14, turns and watches Russell pass.  We linger
	on her face for just a moment, full of wonder.

					WILLIAM
			We should probably head back sometime.

	Russell ignores him.

					PASSING FAN # 2
				(holding red cup)
			Watch out, there's acid in the beer
			that's in the Red cups.

	Russell looks at the cup in his own hand.  It's white.  Then,
	with his other hand, he grabs the red cup and drains it.
	William winces.  They move on.

					RUSSELL
			Topeka.  Check it out.

	Russell enters the bathroom.  William stands guard.  With a
	finger outstretched from each hand, he lectures the fans massing
	in the hallway.

					WILLIAM
			Please don't give him any more acid.

	86    INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER			86

	William watches as a wobbly Russell Hammond, in sunglasses
	now, goes through Aaron's record collection.  He places the
	albums over his face, like masks.

					RUSSELL
			Faces.  Stones.  Sa-weet Baby James!!
			None of these people are gonna be around
			in twenty years!  Plastic begets
			plastic!!   Black plastic.

	Partygoers are strangely fascinated by the rock star in their
	living room.

								 INTERCUT:

	87    INT. BACK BEDROOM -- NIGHT					87

	William waits anxiously to use the phone, keeping an eye on
	Russell.  Russell is now strangely twisting/dancing with four
	girls in the living room, as more cars arrive outside.

					KID ON PHONE
			He's here right now!  Go ahead and put
			it Out over the radio, tell people to
			bring food And beer and chicks.  We're
			at Rural Route # 4 -

					WILLIAM
			No no.  Nope.  No.

	William takes the phone and hangs up.  Keeping an eye on Russell
	in the next room, he dials from a tour itinerary sheet.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			Dick Roswell, please?
				(beat)
			Dick!!  I got him!!  He's okay... I've
			been Looking after him.  He's on acid,
			though.  I can't Really tell.  How do
			you know when it's "kicked in?"

	88    EXT. AARON'S BACKYARD - NIGHT					88

	Russel stands on the jutting corner of the house rooftop.
	The unlit, unheated greenish family pool beckons to him below.
	It's kicked in.

					RUSSELL
				(bellowing to the heavens)
			I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!

	Russell cackles at the joke of it all.  William yells up from
	down below.

					WILLIAM
			Hey Russell -

					RUSSELL
			I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!

					WILLIAM
			Don't jump, okay?

					RUSSELL
			And you can tell Rolling Stone Magazine
			my last words were -

	He spreads his arms, and tries to think of last words.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			-- I'm on drugs!!

	The kids cheer.  William looks around, remains cool.  Yells
	upward in the cold night air.

					WILLIAM
			I think we should work on those last
			words.

					RUSSELL
			Critic!!

					WILLIAM
			No, I'm not -

					RUSSELL
			Okay I got it.  I got it.  I got it.
			I got it.   This is better.  Last words
			-
				(spreads his arms, his
			greatest realization)
			I DIG MUSIC!!

	It gets a skimpy reaction from the partygoers.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
				(immediately)
			I'm on drugs!!

	They applaud again.

					WILLIAM
			Just come on down!!

					RUSSELL
				(matter-of-fact)
			Okay.

	He jumps from the roof into the cold, algaed water below.  He
	sinks immediately.  One kid jumps in, then another, then more.

	Everybody wants to save Russell.

	89    EXT. AARON'S NEIGHBORHOOD -- EARLY MORNING			89

	It's getting lighter.  Cars line the street.  And now, finally
	turning the corner, is Doris the Bus.

	90    INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING						90

	William watches the effects of personal charisma.  Wet
	partygoers surround Russell, bottle of Jack Daniels still in
	hand,  wrapped in towels.  Now a bond has passes between them,
	all of them.  Algae drips from the corner of Russell's face
	and neck.

					RUSSELL
			Thanks for saving my life.  I won't
			hold it against you.

	Twenty different kids thank him for the opportunity.  ("Glad
	to do it," "Right on," "Damn straight.")

	91    INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN -- MORNING				91

	Door opens.  Dick enters.  Finding the guitarist in the kitchen,
	he clicks into time-tested road-managerial maintenance.  Easing
	Russell out of his towel, slipping his own jacket around him,
	from Russell's hands.

					DICK
				(privately)
			They've been crying for you like a
			bunch of whimpering pussies --

					RUSSELL
				(woozy)
			The band is over.  This is my family
			now.

					OTHERS
			Right on.  He's staying with us.

					DICK
				(soothing)
			Definitely.  It's all over.  We'll
			just ride on to Greenville, listen to
			some great music, finish the tour, and
			leave those ungrateful fools behind.
			And then we'll come back here, where
			you'll live.

					RUSSELL
			I know what you're doing... and I like
			it.
				(noticing William)
			Look at him.  He's taking notes with
			his eyes.
				(beat, to Dick)
			How do we know he's not a cop?

	William laughs painfully, as Russell moves in, eyes flaring
	with sudden paranoia.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			He could be selling information!

					DICK
				(to Russell)
			Easy.  He's your Guardian Angel.

	Russell turns away.  William shrugs with style, but his
	lingering look is filled with hurt.  Dick guides Russell to
	the door, grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as
	they move.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Don't worry.  He only means half of
			what he says.

					WILLIAM
			Which half?

					DICK
			Good question.

					WILLIAM
				(very direct)
			I have a lot more.  Just help me get
			my interview so I can go home from
			Greenville.  I have to go home.
				(pulls him back)
			I have to go home.

					DICK
			Hey.  You saved the tour.   That's
			good enough for now.

	Frustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of
	Russell's wet clothes. William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes
	and smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the
	partygoer who also wears his belt.  They move to the door in a
	pack.  We hear the beginning of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer."
	Dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important"
	stage voice.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Ladies and Gentlemen, the evening is
			over!  We hope you've enjoyed
			yourselves, and we'll See you again in
			1974!!  Good evening!!

	William gives Russell his sunglasses to face the sunlight.
	Russell stumbles out of the house to great cheers.  The Quiet
	Girl breaks free to catch Russell on the way out.

					QUIET GIRL
			I'll never forget you.

	Dick pats William's arm one more time -- good work.  They leave
	Aaron's house as legends.

	92    INT. TOUR BUS -- MORNING - 5 AM					92

	"Tiny Dancer" continues on the bus stereo.  Russell sits up
	front, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent.   The others
	have given him a wide berth.  He feels silly, and they know
	it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel
	foolish.  He sits silently.  William watches him from four
	rows back, next to Penny.  She kisses the top of his forehead,
	a hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins.  There is
	only more silence.  Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or
	two, fighting the quiet and singing along.  Then others...
	waking up... joining in.  Then Jeff.  Russell hears them and
	starts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around.
	It's a voice everyone wants to hear.  Like it or not, this is
	his family.

									FADE OUT

	FADE IN:

	93    EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY						93

	Passing signs announce Greenville, North Carolina.

	94    INT. LESTER BANGS BEDROOM - DAY					94

	Lester on the phone.  He is paler than ever, in a room clogged
	with vinyl, happily listening to the MC5 in the background.

					LESTER
			How's it going?

								 INTERCUT:

	95    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY					95

	It's a small wooden-walled hotel room in Greenville.  Polexia
	tries on clothes.  William barely notices as he talks to Lester
	on the phone.

					WILLIAM
			Rolling Stone is calling me.  I don't
			have my key interview.  I don't know
			what to say.

					LESTER BANGS
				(pacing, assembling thoughts
			with his hands)
			You're flipping out.  That's good.
			Alright.  This is how you blow their
			minds.  He'll ask you - this is Ben
			Fong-Torres, right? - he'll ask you
			how the story's going.  Here's what
			you do - let's fry his mind.  Tell him
			"it's a think piece about a mid-level
			band struggling with their own
			limitations in the harsh face of
			stardom."  Ha ha!!  This is fun!

	William scrambles to make notes.

					WILLIAM
				(madly copying)
			... think... piece...

	CLOSE ON WRITING

	Longhand small script on yellow legal tablets.

	96    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT					96

	William sits in the tub, without water.  It's his makeshift
	office, he's surrounded with scraps of notepaper.  He writes
	savagely, and now, savagely throws it away.

	97    INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NIGHT					97

	In the bedroom, Sapphire, Polexia and Penny watch The Midnight
	Special.  Sapphire looks at a room service menu.

					SAPPHIRE
			It says the food is hearty and
			adventurous.

					POLEXIA
				(yawns)
			Greenville.  I'm bored.

	Penny yawns too, it's catchy, and rises to visit the bathroom.

					POLEXIA (cont'd)
			Hey let's deflower the kid.

	Now Sapphire yawns, looks in her purse.

					SAPPHIRE
			Who his the quaaludes from me?

	98    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT					98

	Penny enters to see William writing in the tub.  She sits on
	the toilet to pee.  Flustered:

					WILLIAM
			Wait.  I'll leave.

	He gets up, knocking his carefully organized notes onto the
	floor.  He is brimming with things to say.  More than he is
	even able to communicate.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			You know, I think this is going
			backwards for me.

					PENNY
			Backwards?

					WILLIAM
				(flustered)
			I don't know.  I just thought we could
			hang out, maybe do some stuff back
			home, regular stuff, get to know each
			other better... and then I'd see you
			pee.  I mean, that's the way I usually
			do it.

					PENNY
			You're one of us.  It's no big deal.

					WILLIAM
			I'm not one of you.

					PENNY
			Oh!  If you go to Cleveland, Bowie's
			going to be there at Swingo's, the
			greatest hotel in America.  I'll
			introduce you to him, and his security
			guy Dennis.

	William stops at the door.

					WILLIAM
			Don't you have any regular friends?

					PENNY
			Famous people are just more interesting.

	He looks at her.  Even sitting on the can, she's elegant and
	totally focused on him.

					WILLIAM
				(carefully)
			Well, I would be worried that they
			were using me.  And not that anybody's
			using you, but -

	She swoons a little, touched and moved.

					PENNY
			Boy, if this was the real world and
			some guy talked to me like that -

					WILLIAM
			Let me finish.
				(continuing)
			I'm not famous.... but you could always
			use me.   If anything happens.  And I
			would never use you.  Even if I got
			famous.  So you know, you always have
			that from me... in the real world.  If
			you ever have to go back there, for
			anything.

	She looks at him curiously, as the door blasts open.  Sapphire
	and Polexia head for William.

					SAPPHIRE
			Your time has come.

					WILLIAM
			Did he call?
				(realizes their intention)
			What are you -- stop it -- we're talking
			here.

					SAPPHIRE
			Pants him.  Opie must die.

	They swarm him, dragging him kicking into the bedroom.

	99    INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NIGHT					99

	Steely Dan, looking pale and somehow snappy, perform "Do It
	Again" on The Midnight Special.  The girls force William onto
	the bed, and envelope him.  Their sexuality is fun, untroubled.
	Shot moves past bodies crossing frame, onto William's face.

	ANGLE ON PENNY

	Across room, sitting and watching.

					SAPPHIRE
			Just relax.  Take a vacation from
			yourself.  Leave this to professionals.

	Estrella and Polexia kiss each other playfully.  William looks
	confused.  Across the room, Penny laughs, turns up the TV,
	blows him a kiss.

	Penny's eyes.  Across the room.

	His eyes.

	His sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them, but
	to him it's an embarrassingly  intense moment he shares only
	with Penny Lane -- across the room.  She turns away, smiling,
	disappears into the next room.

	ON STEELY DAN

	On the television.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	99A  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - HANDHELD		99A

	Post-sex pajama party.  Sapphire, Estrella, and Polexia girltalk
	about their first rock and roll conquests.  Penny is conspicuous
	by her absence.  William is under the sheets, listening, feeling
	different, now a man and somehow one of the girls too.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	100   INT. BEDROOOM -- NEXT MORNING					100

	William is awake.  Sunlight floods in from the corners of the
	window-shades.  He is surrounded by the fallen cavalry of the
	night before... Sapphire and Polexia.  The phone rings, and
	Sapphire instantly snaps it up, still asleep.  Lost in her
	dreams, she offers the sexiest hello ever.

					SAPPHIRE
				(half-English accent)
			Hello.  Hi, Ben-Fong-Torres from Rolling
			Stone.

	William snatches the phone.

					WILLIAM
				(lowers voice)
			Hello.

	101   INT. BEN FONG-TORRES' KITCHEN -- SATURDAY MORNING			101

	Ben Fong-Torres is up bright and early.

					BEN
			Hello William, this is your editor at --

	He offers the name of the magazine with a swirl that implies
	high-level importance.

					BEN (cont'd)
			Rolling Stone.  How's the story?

	INT. GREENVILLE HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

	William snaps into his very professional tone of equally grave
	importance.

					WILLIAM
			I'm getting good stuff out here.

					BEN
			Sounds like it.

	Next to him, Polexia yawns herself awake.

					POLEXIA
			Man, I need some -

	He clamps a hand over her mouth.

					BEN
				(jocular but tough)
			Now listen.  Get it together.  We're
			both professionals, I don't have to
			tell you this.  You're not out there
			to join the party -- we already have
			one Hunter Thompson.  You're out there
			to interview and Report.  You got me?
			This isn't Creem Magazine, it's Rolling
			Stone.  We need this story in four
			days.  Now I want to know how it's
			shaping up.

					WILLIAM
			It's a think-piece about a mid-level
			band grappling with their limitations
			in the face of the harsh glare of
			success.

					BEN
				(pause)
			I like what we're saying.  Let me try
			and get you a thousand more words.
			It's in consideration for the cover,
			but don't tell the band.

					WILLIAM
				(conflicted)
			Crazy.

	The kid hangs up, now shouldering even more pressure.  He
	unclamps Polexia's mouth.

					POLEXIA
			- coffee.

					SAPPHIRE
			Me too.  Greenville is so boring.
				(to William)
			Any other city in the world and you'd
			still be a virgin.

					WILLIAM
			I'm going out to find Russell.

					SAPPHIRE
			Will you take the laundry?

					WILLIAM
				(to the girls)
			What am I to you?  Tell me right now!
			What. Am.  I.  To.  You.

	102   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY						102

	Circles have sprouted up under William's eyes.  The orange bag
	strapped over his shoulder, he lugs a huge bag of laundry.  He
	consults room list.  A variety of noises and smells drift from
	the band rooms.  He sees Room Service arrive at Dick's door,
	and it's Estrella who opens the door.  (Dick in the
	background.)  She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning --
	as the door shuts.

					WILLIAM
			Houdini... Houdini...

	He arrives at Russell's door.  Two exclamation points have
	been Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign
	is gaffer-taped to his door.  He looks through the crack, at
	the bottom of the door.  Carefully and politely, he knocks.
	Instantly:

					RUSSELL (O.S.)
			GO AWAY!

	Pissed, the kid flips off the door.  He sits down on a chair
	directly across from the room.  Push in on William, who is
	more pent-up than ever.  He tries hard not to cry, taking
	gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past, revealing... he's
	failed.  He cries.

	FADE UP FROM DARKNESS

	A super-energized Russell Hammond looks into William's sleepy
	face.  William's eyes open.  His own sleepy face is evident in
	Russell's sunglasses.  The bag of laundry is still at his feet.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			We'll do the interview in Cleveland!

					WILLIAM
			No.  I can't.  You've got to help me.
			I have to go home.

					RUSSELL
			Come on man, we'll have more time there.
			Don't be tense!!

	He begins rubbing the kid's shoulders.  He's waking up.  There's
	Penny, also rubbing his shoulders.  It is degrading... and
	somehow cool too.

					WILLIAM
				(to Penny)
			You said you'd help me.

					PENNY
				(massaging)
			Come to Cleveland.

					RUSSELL
				(massaging, hypnotically)
			Come to Cleveland... Come to
			Cleveland...

					WILLIAM
			I can't!!

					RUSSELL
			Can we help it if we like having you
			around!

	William is a bundle of nerves and exhaustion now.  Embarrassed
	and frustrated.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Cleveland, my man.  You can't miss out
			on the Rock Mecca of the midwest -
			you're with us.  It's all happening!

					PENNY
			Rock and roll!

					WILLIAM
				(weary)
			Rock and roll.

	We hear David Bowie's live version of "Waiting for the Man."

	103   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAY						103

	They sit together, hair askew, in sunglasses, resting against
	the headboard.  Carefully, Russell identifies his thoughts.

					RUSSELL
			I feel... like his parents.

	Penny runs a worried hand through her hair.

					PENNY
			I know.

					RUSSELL
			I wonder how that happened.

					PENNY
			You ever notice that all our sentences
			begin with "I?"

					RUSSELL
			I hadn't, no.

					PENNY
			'Cause we should work on that.

	He looks at her, plays the guitar a little.

	104   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT						104

	Night.  Doris rocks toward Cleveland on a muggy summer night.
	The windows of passing houses offer rich Edward Hopper glimpses
	of lives and people William will never meet.

	105   INT. WILLIAM'S BUS BUNK - NIGHT					105

	William watches from his bus bunk at the back, head on elbow.
	Looking up, he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the
	mattress above him, as music continues.

	William gets up, nods hello to the Roadie and his Date on the
	bunk above.  He moves down the aisle... to the seats near the
	front.  A sleeping Russell sits upright, hugging his guitar.
	Penny asleep next to him, Polaroid in her hand of... Russell
	sleeping.  The kid moves on.  He sits with the Bus Driver,
	whose CB crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to
	Cleveland.

	ON THE FIRST SIGN - LATE NIGHT

	Cleveland signs.  Music rises.  Heads pop awake.

					RUSSELL
			Cleveland!

	106   EXT. DOWNTOWN CLEVELAND - LATE NIGHT				106

	Like a slow-moving shark, Doris pulls into empty downtown
	Cleveland.  The streets are empty.  They pass the Agoura
	Ballroom, where a man with a long stick arranges the letters
	Stillwater on the marquee.   Applause in the bus.

	107   INT. SWINGO'S CELEBRITY INN - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING		107

	Russell and band enter like warriors, in a pack.  William sags
	with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder.  Here, in
	the middle of the midwest, is an explosive rock mecca, just as
	promised.   The feeling of belonging invades all those in this
	lobby.  Fans and other touring rockers mingle together.
	Outside in the real world, everyone else is going to work.

					FAN
			It's Bowie!

	The lobby ignites, as William stands near Penny and Russell.
	Bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the
	elevators.  He is shrouded by a jacket.  Just the top of his
	electric red hair travels the lobby, as he's hustled by security
	man Dennis in the elevator.  And out of the chaos comes...

	108   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY						108

	Jeff Bebe and Polexia smash against the wall of the Swingo's
	hotel room, making love.

	109   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY						109

	Russell and Penny Lane smash against their own wall.

	109A  INT. ARENA - NIGHT						109A

	Dick squats at the front of the stage, and talks to a few fans
	in the front row of this crowd.

	110   INT. BACKSTAGE CLEVELAND PAY PHONE - NIGHT			110

	A wild Cleveland crowd in the building.  The cities on this
	tour are getting bigger, and so are the audiences.  And there
	is a whiff of business now too.  Men in satin tour jackets and
	some Disc-jockey types cruise the backstage.  A Hysterical Fan
	is led screaming to the nearby medic room.  Few even react -
	it's Cleveland - as the shot finds William, tired and yawning,
	on the backstage pay phone.  He is absolutely ready for the
	worst.

					WILLIAM
			Hi Mom.  I'm in Cleveland.

	He listens stoically.  Larry and Ed watch nearby.

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

	Moms sits in silence.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
				(rehearsed)
			I'm fine! I'm fine!  I'm flying back on
			Monday Morning.  I'll only miss one
			test.  I'll make it up.

	Russell listens in, holding his guitar, laughing.

					RUSSELL
			Tell her you're a slave to the groove
			- you can't help it!

					WILLIAM
				(covers phone)
			No.

	Russell grabs the phone, talks to the silent mother on the
	other end.

					RUSSELL
			Hi Mom!  It's Russell Hammond, I play
			guitar in Stillwater!   It's my fault.
			How does it feel to be the mother of
			the future of rock journalism?
				(beat)
			Hello?

	Silence.   Penny passes and stands near William, smoothing her
	pass.  They watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road-crew.
	They are more glam, more trashy and less selective.  They glare
	insolently at Penny Lane.  This is the future.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			You've got a great kid -- nothing to
			worry about!  We're taking care of
			him!  And you should come to a show
			sometime!  Join the Circus!

					ELAINE
			Listen to me.   Your charm does not
			work on me.  I'm onto you.  Of course
			you like him.

					RUSSELL
			Yes.

					ELAINE
			He worships you people and that's fine
			with you, as long as he helps make you
			rich.

					RUSSELL
				(a nerve is struck)
			Rich?  I don't think so -

					ELAINE
			Listen to me.  He's a smart, good-
			hearted, 15 year-old kid, with infinite
			potential.

	Russel looks over at the kid, eyes narrowing as he processes
	the truth.  He's 15?

					ELAINE (cont'd)
			This is not some apron-wearing mother
			you're talking to.  I know about your
			Valhalla of Decadence, and I shouldn't
			have let him go.  He is not ready for
			your world of compromised values, and
			diminished brain cells that you throw
			away like confetti.  Am I speaking
			clearly to you?

					RUSSELL
			Yes, ma'am.

					ELAINE
			If you break his spirit, harm him in
			any way, keep him from his chosen
			profession -- which is law, Something
			you may not value but I do -- you will
			meet the voice on the other end of
			this telephone.  And it will not be
			pretty.    Do we understand each other?

					RUSSELL
			Yes... yes...

					ELAINE
				(always the teacher)
			I didn't ask for this role, but I'll
			play it.  Now go do your best.  "Be
			bold and mighty forces will come to
			your aide!"  Goethe said that.  It's
			not too late for you to be a person of
			substance.  Get my son home safely,
			I'm glad we spoke.

	She hangs up.  Russell hangs up, oddly affected and shook up.

					WILLIAM
			Some people get her.  Some don't.

	Russell is still recovering.  William feels embarrassed by his
	mother, once again.

	111   ON THE HUDDLE							111

	William with the band.  He yawns, as the band breaks.  Cleveland
	awaits.  We follow Dick, who guides the band onto the stage
	platform, still in darkness.  Already, stomping and applause
	is mounting.  Russell turns to William before taking the stage:

					RUSSELL
			Your Mom kind of freaked me out.

					WILLIAM
			She means well.

	Still rattled, he takes the stage.  We see the unbridled
	enthusiasm of the faces on the front row.  A wave of cigarette
	lighters stretch out before them.

					DICK
				(importantly)
			From Troy, Michigan...

	Russell thwacks a couple chords.  Audience thunders.  He turns
	to other members, feeling chills.  It's in these moments that
	everything else disappears.  They bow and wave, still in
	darkness... each member seems to have his own fans.  Dick lets
	all this play out before finally adding...

					DICK (cont'd)
			Would you please welcome to Cleveland...

	More applause.  This is very very very very fun.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Stillwater.

	Lights come up.  A full blast of audience love hits them right
	in the face, as they begin "Fever Dog."  The band charges
	headlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out
	of the crowd and onto the stage.

	HANDHELD ON RUSSELL

	Who is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his
	guitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back
	into the crowd.  He slips back under the strap, laughing.
	More stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and
	Russell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over
	to Russell to lean on him.  Russell turns to share the moment
	with Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the
	stage.

	112   INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT					112

	William in the dressing room, eyes red with exhaustion, finally
	interviewing Russell.  He holds the mike stoically.

					WILLIAM
			So when you play a great show like
			tonight...

	Dick enters with great urgency.

					DICK
			Okay.  I need everybody's attention.

	The kid shuts his eyes.  He knew this would happen.

					DICK (cont'd)
			Alright, well, the rumors are true.
			The record company has sent a big-time
			manager here to try and talk you into
			replacing me.  His name is Dennis Hope.
			I know you've all heard of him.  He's
			got all the big bands.  He's right
			outside.  He wants five minutes with
			you right now.  I think we gotta do
			it.

					RUSSELL
				(pissed)
			Then bring him in.

	William shuts off his tape recorder.

					JEFF
				(arrogant)
			Bring him in!  We'll send him out on a
			rail!

					RUSSELL
				(to William)
			We'll finish on the way to Boston.
			You can fly home from Boston.

	William nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door.  In walks a
	small general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed
	beard and bowl cut.  He holds the super-new Halliburton
	briefcase.  He is DENNIS HOPE, 25.  A man from the midwest,
	with a vision of the future of rock and roll.  Already in his
	head are all the things that will come to pass.  Higher ticket
	prices.  Merchandising deals.  Greater distribution and
	accounting of album sales.  He shrugs hello to the band.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(completely unthreatening)
			Hi.

					RUSSELL
			We already have a manager.  He's been
			with us from the beginning.

	Hope appreciates the lack of small talk.  He strides the room
	with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort.
	Russell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.

					DENNIS HOPE
			Respectfully.  We all have our roots.
			I believe in bands holding onto their
			roots.  But those roots need to be
			augmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth
			- I may enrage some and enthrall others.
			I don't really give a fuck.   Your
			manager here needs a manager.  Example.
			If you hadn't run out on the contract in
			Phoenix, you could have sued over
			Russell's hand... but you left, negating
			the contract, forfeiting the deposit,
			and you effectively traveled a long
			way to pay that promoter... to
			electrocute you.

	Russell looks at his hand.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			We can all work together.  Your damages
			have put you way into the hole for
			this tour.  Right now you owe the record
			company more than you've got.  But
			your record's selling, there's money
			to be made.  So I've brought a plane
			in, we can add more shows to make-up
			the difference.   Respectfully.

					RUSSELL
				(immediately)
			We travel by bus.

					JEFF
			Doris is the soul of this band!  That
			bus has been our home since we were
			the Jeff Bebe Band.

	Dick watches his loyal band with admiration.

					DENNIS
			Hey man -- it's travel on a pogo stick
			if I thought we'd make more money.
			You can play more dates with a plane...

	112A  INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT - SAME TIME				112A

	Penny Lane stands on stage facing the empty arena.  The roadies
	have packed up and moved on. She is alone in the poetic and
	trash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with
	people.  (Behavior to come)

							 INTERCUT WITH:

	112B  INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT					112B

	The band meeting continues.

					RUSSELL
				(passionate)
			Hey man, it's not about the money!  It's
			about Playing music, and turning people
			on!

	The band agrees.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(delicately)
			Yes, of course.  Clearly.
			Respectfully.   But on the distasteful
			subject of money.  Just know.  You're
			making it -- right now -- and it's all --

	He gestures to infinity.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			-- out there.  I'm just talking about
			bringing it --

	Bringing his hand together in a fist, he returns it, close to
	his heart.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			-- back here.

	The band looks at Dick, who manages not to be speechless.

					DICK
			But why should we pay you for something
			we can do ourselves?

					DENNIS HOPE
				(immediately)
			Do you know how to keep from getting
			charged for the ice below the
			floorboards of Chicago Stadium?
			Do you know how to do a headlining
			tour, do you Claire Rothman at the
			L.A. Forum?  Do you know Bobbi Cowan,
			Lisa Robinson, Jim Ladd, Frank
			Barcelona?
				(look around, amazed)
			This is Cleveland. Where's Kid Leo??
				(basics)
			Do you know how you get a record not
			pressed but played?  Do you know?  I
			didn't invent the rainy day, man.  I
			just own the best umbrella.

	He laughs.  It's fun.  Band members are now listening, curiously
	spellbound.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			Because as much as you may believe that
			it will last forever, it does not last
			forever... your biggest fan right now
			soon they're going to go to college,
			gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money
			some other way, and you know what?
				(the final insult)
			They'll tape your record from a friend's
			copy.

	Russell stops fingering his guitar.  Shot moves across the
	faces of the band members.  Pain.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			You've got to take what you can, when you
			can, while you can.  And you've got to do
			it now.  That's what the big boys do.

	The band squirms, but listens.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			Because if you think Mick Jagger will
			still be out there trying to be a rock
			star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly
			mistaken.

	Now he's reaching them.  Their slackened roar-weary faces stare
	back at the young dynamo.

					DICK
				(flustered)
			Yeah, well... we'll think about what
			you said.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(casually)
			No no.  You don't understand.  I'll
			think about it.  I'm not auditioning.
			I came here to decide whether I want
			to represent you.  So I'll stand outside
			for a moment, and think about whether
			I want to stay.

	He leaves the room with a pleasant shrug.  Stunned silence.
	William watches their body language.  No one wants to talk
	first.  Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can
	we talk him into staying?

	113   INT. PLANE -- DAY							113

	William watches as the band stands inside the new plane.  Dennis
	Hope looks on.

					RUSSELL
			This is not us.   This is too much.

	He looks around for support.  Grim nodding faces.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
				(impressed at seat)
			This is too much.

	William watches as Russell reclines.  Russell grabs Penny, and
	she falls into the seat next to him.   We hear the loud oncoming
	sound of the plane in flight, as Dennis cooly asks for Penny's
	seat.

					DENNIS HOPE
			Do you mind?

	114   EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY					114

	Doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near
	a field.  The new plane lifts off in the background, as the
	bus sits alone, as if crying steel tears.  Bus Banner reads
	simply: CLEVELAND.  Reprise ending of Whole Lotta Love.

	115   INT. PLANE  NIGHT							115

	The girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane,
	with William.

	116   INT. BOSTON HOTEL ROOM HALLWAY -- DAY				116

	William trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook,
	trolling for Russell.   He passes Boston travelogue posters on
	the walls.  A few room doors are open, he looks for any sign
	of the guitarist.   William veers into Dick's room, where a
	poker game full of Roadies is in progress.  The room is thick
	with exotic smoke.   They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs,
	smoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening
	not to rock and roll... but Sarah Vaughn.

					WILLIAM
			Anyone seen Russell?

					DICK
			The Enemy!

	Door widens to reveal Russell.

					RUSSELL
			Hey!  Welcome to the Road Crew Poker
			Party.  This game's been going of for
			two years.

					DICK
			That's Mick - he's with The Who.  That's
			John - with J. Geils.  And that's
			Richard with the Eagles... and you know
			The Wheel.

					THE WHEEL
			Hey.

	Grumbling roadies continue playing.  Like an old pro, the kid
	turns down a Cola-can hash-pipe.  This hand is down to Dick,
	and a roadie named REG from Humble Pie.

					DICK
			Side proposition.  For fifty dollars
			and a case of Heineken, I will put
			into the pot... three Lovely Ladies,
			Including the famous Penny Lane... the
			Band-Aids, who need to exit our tour
			before New York...

					REG
			It's a deal.  Show 'em.

	Dick lays down three tens.  Reg lays down three Kings.  Dick
	loses.

					DICK
			Three Lovely Ladies... now in the
			custody of Humble Pie.

					REG
			Alright, so we owe you fifty dollars
			and a case of Heineken.

	Embarrassed, Russell notices the kids face.  He leans over,
	and speaks confidentially to him.

					RUSSELL
			Look.  Nobody's feelings are getting
			hurt here.  She already knows Leslie's
			coming To New York tomorrow.  They all
			understand.  This is the Circus.
			Everybody's trying not to go home.
			Nobody's saying goodbye.

					WILLIAM
			No, I got it.

					RUSSELL
			These are the Rules that come with
			every electric Guitar and every
			amplifier.  They're not just written
			anywhere.  Rock and roll, brother.  No
			attachments.  No boundaries.

	But the kid feels bad, and Russell knows it.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Quit looking at me like that.

	116A  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON						116A

	The kid is still stuck on the road.  He is in hell now.
	Wearily, with deep circles under his eyes, he shuts his eyes
	for a moment.  Another band is moving through.

					SABBATH ROADIE
			Keep this hallway clear!

	117   INT. BACKSTAGE TRAILER/DRESSING ROOM -- AFTERNOON			117

	William and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room
	bench.  It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies,
	guitars and men in stages of half-dress.  Piles of luggage
	headed for New York sit by the door.  The door suddenly opens
	and Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a
	sparkler.  It is placed in Penny's lap. It reads: Unforgettable
	Penny... Age Unknown.  Boston, 1973.   They gather now as the
	cake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane.

					DICK
			Happy Birthday from us.

	William watches her face as she reads the message on the cake.
	It hasn't sunk in yet.

	Russell produces a piece of hotel stationery.  He reads a poem.

					RUSSELL
			So Penny our friend has gained another year.
			But long ago, she threw it in gear.
			She rocked the south
			The East and West.
			Could you please get off this endless tour
			Where we're Black Sabbath's fucking
			 special guest?

	Laughter.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			She says she's retired
			Though we've heard that before.
			She chose us...
			And in Penny Lane we trust
			She is a fan of this band.
			Much more so than us.

	William watches her face.  Still enchanted, she hands out slices
	of the cake.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(to the point)
			Sorry the plane isn't bigger.

	It hits her.  She looks at William for a clue.  His truthful
	face does not look away.  Now she knows.  She turns to the
	others -- the plane isn't bigger?  Shot moves in on Penny as
	she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging
	for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy
	laughter.  Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to
	connect with band members.  Each of them look away, nobody
	maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't
	look at.  William.  She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn
	Monroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers.
	Russell watches, as we push in on Penny.  She notices all the
	luggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.

	118   EXT. CONCORD PAVILLION BACKSTAGE -- EARLY MORNING			118

	William exits a backstage Portosan.  Penny catches him by the
	grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event.
	Their laminated passes swing from around their necks.  Thuding
	in the distance, Stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd.
	The sound of summer insects in the air.

					PENNY
			So it wasn't a birthday party, it was
			a farewell.

	William doesn't answer.  He looks at her, blowing some hair
	out of her face.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			You think you can fool me.  I read
			you.  I know what you're thinking.

					WILLIAM
			What's that?

					PENNY
				(touched)
			You're worried about me and Russell.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.  I gotta work on that.

					PENNY
			You're so sweet.  God -- if there was
			more of you in him...

					WILLIAM
			Don't tell me this stuff.  I want to
			like him.

					PENNY
				(concerned for him)
			Did you miss your test or something?

	He shakes his head.  It's so beyond a test.

					PENNY (cont'd)
			I know I'm not on the plane, and I'm
			not going on some other band's bus.  I
			mean, I could go with the Sabbath road
			crew, but that would be pathetic.  The
			girls are all going with Humble Pie.
			If you could find out from Russell --

					WILLIAM
				(quietly)
			Penny -

					PENNY
				(a decision)
			Forget it.  I'm flying to New York
			myself.  I have a bunch of partial
			tickets.  I know his ex-wife, current
			girlfriend's going to be there -

	William's eyebrows rise.  She examines his face for clues.

					WILLIAM
			-- I'm not sure that's a good idea.

					PENNY
				(overlapping)
			What?  What are you saying?  What do
			you know?  Did Russell say something?

					WILLIAM
			I don't know anything.

					PENNY
			I know he wants me there.  He gave me
			a cake.  He wrote me that sweet poem.

					WILLIAM
				(loud)
			Wake up!  Don't go to New York!

					PENNY
			What are you telling me?

	She looks so achingly beautiful to him.

					WILLIAM
			Because you're not who you said you
			were!  I thought you were retired!

					PENNY
			You're right.  I'm not who I said I
			was.  I'm just like you. I love music,
			so this is my family.  Some people
			like tractors, and they hang out with
			tractor people.  What's the worst that
			could happen if I go to New York?
				(little girl)
			"I get my little heart broken?"

					WILLIAM
			Oh no.  Never you!  You eat people
			alive!

	She tears some leaves off a tree.  He looks at her, unable to
	formulate a response.

					PENNY
				(accusatory)
			I'm sorry I told you so much.   You
			have some way of making everybody tell
			you all their secrets.

					WILLIAM
			That's a good one.  Tell me too much
			and make it my fault.

	He continues walking, she follows.  They have ventured outside
	the backstage area, onto adjoining Boston farmland.  The show
	booms in the background.

					PENNY
			Come on.  You've seen what's happened.
			Russell and I fell in love.  How much,
			I don't know... but this is the first
			time I've fallen for someone, really
			fallen... since Iggy, and I'm not happy
			about it.

					WILLIAM
				(beat)
			You slept with Iggy Pop!?

	She says nothing.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
				(sputtering)
			Why don't you just tell me now, who
			else -- so when I go to the record
			store, I know who to be jealous of.
			Because right now, it's looking like
			the whole store!

	He's upset.   She stares at him.

					PENNY
				(teasing, defiant)
			You'll remember me forever.  I was
			there when you lost your virginity.

					WILLIAM
				(upset at the memory)
			So was Steely Dan!  It was a crowded
			room.

	She laughs, can't help it.  Then:

					PENNY
			You make me laugh.  I think I'm gonna
			cry.

					WILLIAM
				(continuing)
			I thought we were going to Morocco!
			There's no Morocco.  There's never been
			a Morocco.  There's not even a Penny
			Lane.  I don'teven know your real
			name.

					PENNY
			If I ever met a guy in the real world,
			who looked at me the way you just looked
			at me...

					WILLIAM
			When and where does the real world
			occur?  I am really... confused here.
			Fuck!  All these Rules And all these
			sayings... and nicknames...

					PENNY
			You know -- you're too sweet for rock
			and roll.

					WILLIAM
			Where do you get off... where do you
			get "sweet?"  I'm not sweet.  I'm dark
			and mysterious and pissed-off and I
			could be very dangerous to all of you...
			I'm not sweet, and you should know
			that about me!  I am The Enemy.

					PENNY
			You're not any of those things and
			that's what I love about you.

	William stands there in disbelief, unable to look at her.

					WILLIAM
			You fall in love to keep from falling
			in love.

					PENNY
			I don't want to go home!

					WILLIAM
			Well, I have to go home.  And you never
			helped me.

					PENNY
			Yes I did.

					WILLIAM
			That disc-jockey in Arizona got a better
			interview than me... and he was asleep.

	He starts walking back to the stage.  She follows.  They are
	two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll.
	His frustration increases.  She just doesn't get it.  Applause
	in b.g.  She grabs his shirt.

					PENNY
			Look.  You should be happy for me.
			You don't know what he says to me in
			private.  Maybe it is love.  As much
			as it can be with someone who --

					WILLIAM
				(blurts)
			-- sold you to Humble Pie for fifty
			dollars and a case of beer?  I was
			there!

	He is instantly sorry.  Her world privately crumbles, but she
	tries to remain stoic and carefree.

					PENNY
			What kind of beer?

	119   INT. HUMBLE PIE CREW TRUCK -- DAY					119

	Sapphire, Polexia, and Estrella bump along to the music and
	the road.  They strain to maintain dignity in these decidedly
	third-class surroundings.  There's only one small blurry window.

					POLEXIA
			Who did this to us?

	120   INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT				120

	Mom on the phone.

					ELAINE
			Then don't come home.  Don't do this
			to me.  If you're going to miss
			graduation, don't come home.

	She hangs up.

	121   INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- NIGHT					121

	William on the phone.   Speechless.

	122   INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM -- DAY					122

	Elaine faces her Humanities class.  She stands in an
	amphitheater-style, inner-city college classroom, decorated
	with colorful unorthodox artifacts from her home.  These earnest
	city college students listen to her.  But she cannot continue.
	There is a thundering upset inside her.

					ELAINE
			I'm sorry.  I can't concentrate.
				(beat, confesses, unhinged)
			Rock stars kidnaped my son.

	123   INT. BAND PLANE -- DAY						123

	Music.  Russell and band bounces down in NYC.  Russell listens
	to music on headphones plugged into large boom box.

	124   INT. LIMOUSINE -- DAY						124

	William watches, facing the band from the jump seat of their
	limousine, heading into New York.  Up ahead, Manhattan looms,
	beautiful and scary.

					RUSSELL
			"New York.  Just like I pictured it...
			"

					JEFF
			" ... skyscrapers and everything."

					RUSSELL
				(to William)
			We showed you America.  We did
			everything but get you laid.

	Beat.  They look at each other curiously.  How much does the
	other guy know?

	125   EXT. ST. REGIS -- DAY						125

	Russell and band spill out of limo.  The New York cluster of
	hardcore Stillwater fans wait outside.  They hold collector's
	sleeves covering albums to be autographed, and fresh magic
	markers in hand.  William in tow crawls out of the limo last.
	Dick goes to work, pulling luggage from the trunk.  A serious-
	looking Fan (LENNY) approaches Russell with an autograph card.

					FAN
			I'm from the Church of Lenny.   We bow
			to his will and all that it represents
			- The King of the King of Kings.

					RUSSELL
			Make it out to - ?

					FAN
			To Lenny.

	Russell nods -- of course.  He signs, as Dick approaches with
	a well-placed word in his right ear.

					DICK
			She's here.

	William turns, expecting to see Penny.  Instead we see the
	long-limbed, athletic, pretty and collegiate LESLIE.    She
	holds a Nikon camera, and snaps their picture.

					JEFF
			Leslie!

					DICK
			Your room is completely stocked, far
			away from any noisy ice machines,
			elevators or maid quarters.  The air-
			conditioning is already on.  And here
			is your security key -- by the way,
			you look stunning.

					LESLIE
				(taking treatment for
			granted)
			ThanksI'llseeyoulater.

	Nearby, the young journalist studies the tour's subtle shift
	in welcoming Leslie.   Dick's New York side is almost military.

					DICK
			Bags in five!  Cars leave for the party
			at six!

	William studies Leslie, everyone saying hello to her, everyone
	knowing the subtext.  Nobody saying a word.  William pulls his
	heavy bag out of the back of the limousine.
	The bag breaks, and the contents spill out onto the New York
	sidewalk.  Bars of soap, ashtrays, hotel keys, crumpled paper,
	the contraband t-shirt, "Do Not Disturb" signs, notes, towels
	and thick telephone books from every city.

					DICK (cont'd)
			You know.  There are lighter souvenirs.

					WILLIAM
				(embarrassed)
			Well -- I kept thinking I was going
			home the next day --

					DICK
			I did too.  Fifteen years ago.

	All help him with his spilled souvenirs.  Russell shares a
	private look with the kid.  Nearby Leslie greets other band
	members.

					WILLIAM
			Ric!

	It's Super Zeppelin fan Ric Nunez.

					RIC
				(whispers)
			It's all happening.  Zeppelin is at
			the Plaza.  So's four other bands.
			They're partying up there right now.
			Sapphire, and Miss Penny Lane too...
			She wants you to call her.
				(William reacts)
			They're all staying under the name
			Emily Rugburn.

	William takes in the information, while regarding Ric's new
	custom  shirt, which features the words to Zeppelin's "The Rain
	Song."

					RUSSELL
				(exiting with Leslie)
			After the party.  I'll come to your
			room - I promise.  We'll talk.  This
			is Leslie, by the way.  Leslie, this
			is our wayward friend from Rolling
			Stone.  The Enemy.

	They shake, she smiles randomly.

	126   INT. ST. REGIS FRONT DESK -- NIGHT				126

	William checks in.

					CLERK
			William Miller?  Sir, you have an urgent
			call from a Mr. "Ben Fong-Torres."
			He's holding for you, right now.

	William takes the phone.  The Clerk watches curiously as the
	kid adopts a new persona.

					WILLIAM
				(deep voice)
			Hello.

									INTERCUT

	INT. JANN'S OFFICE -- SAN FRANCISCO -- AFTERNOON

	On a rainy day in San Francisco, Ben Fong-Torres stands in the
	copy-strewn office of the young editor/publisher JANN WENNER.
	Several other editors are also present in the background,
	including David Felton with cigarette-holder in mouth, and a
	prep-school Fact-Checker named ALLISON.

					BEN
			Congratulations.  It's gonna be a cover.
			Neal Preston will shoot 'em next week
			in L.A.  we need you back in San
			Francisco tomorrow.  We'll finish the
			story here.

	William is overwhelmed with many emotions, fear topping the
	list.

					BEN (cont'd)
			You can tell the band.  Allison, our
			fact checker, needs you to transmit
			whatever you have of the story, tonight,
			now, along with your notes.  There is
			a mojo at the Daily News they'll let
			us use -

					WILLIAM
			Mojo?

					BEN
			A mojo.  It's a very modern machine
			that transmits pages over the telephone.
			It only takes eighteen Minutes a page...

	126A  EXT. NEW YORK STREETS -- NIGHT					126A

	The sound of feet on pavement.  William looks at addresses,
	hustling to the Daily News office.

	126B  INT. DAILY NEWS COPY STATION -- NIGHT				126B

	William tears pages from his notebook and feeds them into the
	large and clunky earliest model fax machine -- "The Mojo."  We
	hear David Bowie.  "The Jean Genie."

	A127  EXT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT					A127

	William weaves, exhausted, into the Stillwater press party at
	this legendary New York nightspot.  The Doorman, who checks
	i.d.s, sees the kid and expresses great doubt.

					DENNIS HOPE
			He's okay, he's with us -

	Hope shoves him past the Guard, and sends him into a very mature
	new world.

	127   INT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT					127

	The famous hub of New York rock and roll.  A strong whiff of
	decadence mixes with youthful naivete.  Not a hippie in sight.
	William walks through, looking for familiar faces.  Overhead
	we hear Stillwater.  "If You Say Nothing."  The party is filled
	with scenesters, long silver-haired glamsters, some British
	journalists, and many hunched young skinny bodies in leather
	jackets.  Russell grabs him by the arm.

					RUSSELL
			Ah ha!  There you are, ya little fucker.
			Come on --

					WILLIAM
			I have some good news.

					RUSSELL
			-- I'll piss to that.  Follow me.

	A128  INT. MAX'S BEDROOM						A128

	They enter the small bathroom.  Russell bolts the door, faces
	the urinal and pees.  His own music throbs in the next room.

					RUSSELL
			Dennis Hope took me aside, and wants
			to manage Me solo.  Says to lose the
			band by February.  Should I do it?  I
			have no perspective anymore.

	William pees in silence.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			At what point do I just take the hint?
			Nobody Loves this band.  People like
			us, do they love us?

					WILLIAM
			I do.

					RUSSELL
				(then pissed)
			Oh - get this - somebody told Penny
			Lane I sold her for beer.  The network
			of these chicks!  Like I would do that.
			It's Jeff who told her, right?  Not
			you, right?  None of these guys can
			just calm down and be a fuckin adult.
			Now she's here, freaking out.  Leslie
			can smell it.

					WILLIAM
				(exiting)
			Wait.  I've got something to tell -

	But he finds himself trailing Russell to the back room bar.

	128   INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT - SAME TIME				128

	Leslie in the bathroom.  Penny enters and watches her
	discreetly.  They stand together, side-by-side at the mirror.
	Leslie looks once, turns and then turns back at Penny.  She
	knows.

	129   INT. BACKROOM -- NIGHT						129

	William sits with the band.  Over Jeff's head, Penny hangs
	nearby, at the outskirts, drinking and dancing.  They share a
	look, feigning casualty.

					WILLIAM
			You guys -- you guys --
				(beat)
			You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling
			Stone.

	Stunned and overwhelmed, the band waits a beat, lets it sink
	in... and goes wild.  Russell, stunned too, looks at the kid.
	It's big news.  Jeff stands immediately, eyes moist, glass
	raised.

					JEFF
				(tears welling, instantly)
			The cover of Rolling Stone.  And we
			made it together.  They don't just put
			somebody with one little hit on the
			cover of Rolling Stone Fucking Magazine,
			man.  We made it.

	The band nods solemnly, importantly.

					JEFF (cont'd)
				(continuing)
			Damn it -- I'm gonna enjoy this.  The
			first time I bought that magazine The
			Beatles were on the cover.  Four of
			them.  Four of us.  Together.
			TOGETHER!

	They begin singing the then-current Dr. Hook and the Medicine
	Show hit, "The Cover of the Rolling Stone" to William.

					LESLIE
			Who is that girl?  She's creeping me
			out.  She's not with any of you, is
			she?

					WILLIAM/DICK
			She's with me.

	And now Leslie has confirmation.  A symphony of looks, as Dick
	gets to his feet and moves to confront Penny.  Penny Lane's
	eyes fill and she runs out.  Russell stands... and sees William
	also stand.  William turns and follows her.  Russell stands
	watching, and does not leave.   We hear Elton John's  "Mona
	Lisas and Mad Hatters."

	130   EXT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT					130

	William exits as a crush of Partygoers arrives.  He doesn't
	know where she is.   He takes off to examine the cabs stuck in
	traffic.  Song continues.

	POV WILLIAM

	He looks in the backs of cabs.   None of them her.

	Music continues.  He runs down the streets, looking for her.
	Alone in New York City.

	131   INT. PLAZA HOTEL -- NIGHT						131

	William on the house phone.

					WILLIAM
			Emily Rugburn, please.

	132   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY -- NIGHT					132

	William approaches Suite 702.  The door is open.  He hears new
	band voices, and sees new faces. MUSICIAN  # 1 intercepts him.

					WILLIAM
			Hi.  I'm a friend of Penny Lane's.

					MUSICIAN # 1
			Aren't we all -

	Musician types are leaving.

					WILLIAM
			Where is she?

	Room Service arrives.  Some appetizers and a large expensive
	bottle of champagne on ice.

					ROOM SERVICE GUY
			Can somebody sign for this?

	William does.

					ROOM SERVICE GUY (cont'd)
			Thank you Mr. Rugburn.

	Two more Musicans (English) exit the back room party.  The
	room is clearing out.

					ENGLISH MUSICIAN
			She's sick.  Let's get out of here.

					ENGLISH MUSICIAN # 2
			She used to be so much more together.

	William watches all, champagne in hand, and finds her in the
	backroom.  She's addled and nearly passed out.

					WILLIAM
			What happened?

					PENNY LANE
			I'm not good at goodbyes.

	She sags.  He grabs the phone.

					PENNY LANE (cont'd)
			You're the last of my old-time friends.
			Polexia went to England with Deep
			Purple... can you believe that?  Even
			Sapphire's out someplace else.  All
			she left was her quaaludes.

					WILLIAM
			Oh -- wonderful.
				(into phone)
			Front desk?  Please send a doctor.
			Room... what room?  703.  702.   Both
			rooms, either room.  This is Mr. Rugburn,
			Yes.  My wife's had an accident with
			some quaaludes.  Yes - I'll do that.

	The room has emptied out.  Just them, and the remnants of a
	movable party that has moved elsewhere.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			Wake up!

	He struggles to get her on her feet.  She tips over on her
	strappy platform shoes.  He struggles to untie them.

	133   EXT. GRADUATION -- DAY						133

	The School band plays "Colour My World."  School PRINCIPAL at
	the podium.

					PRINCIPAL
			And now... out graduating class!  Jane
			Abbott!

	A peppy student bounds up and grabs her diploma.   Elaine Miller
	watches dolefully in the audience.

	134   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						134

	William holds Penny in his arms.  Finally she is close to him.

	135   EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY -- DAY					135

					PRINCIPAL
			Victor Sanchez!

	Warm applause for another student who grabs his diploma.  He
	takes off his mortar board to flash an American flag bandana.
	He raises his diploma in victory.

	136   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						136

	William holds Penny Lane, and keeps her moving.  It's a sagging,
	messy slow dance.

					WILLIAM
			"In the unlikely event of a water
			landing... "

					PENNY
			"... you will be required to wear a
			safety vest."

					WILLIAM
			Keep going.

					PENNY
			"Please place all stowable luggage in
			the overhead compartments... out in the
			seat in front of you."

					WILLIAM
				(prompting)
			"Seat and tray tables."

					PENNY
			"And seat-backs and tray-tables should
			be in their full and upright and locked
			positions... "

	137   EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY -- DAY					137

					PRINCIPAL
			And now... out "Pending" Graduates!
				(pause)
			William Miller... not present.

	Elaine applauds her son, stoically.  It is a dagger through
	her heart.  A sympathetic look from a nearby Mother continues
	the pain.

	138   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT						138

	They move slowly, she's fading.

					WILLIAM
			"In the tragic event of a water
			landing..."

	139   EXT. GRADUATION - DAY						139

	The Principal shares a few thoughts:

					PRINCIPAL
			And to the class of 1973, we say --
				(beat)
			Don't forget to remember yourself as
			you are today...  Full of hope... and
			the dream that everything is possible...
			Remember this, twenty years from now,
			when we all own home computers and we
			all travel in shiny electrical cars
			that move swiftly, high above the
			city...
				(beat)
			They key to the future is keeping today
			alive forever.

	Elaine's head lowers slowly in a sea of happy parents.  The
	day will never end.  Mrs. Deegan slips into the seat next to
	her.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			First.  Release the guilt.
				(Elaine nods)
			Second -

					ELAINE
			Please let there be only two, because
			I can't get past Number One.

					MRS. DEEGAN
			Second.  Leave a little room for the
			other teachers in this world.  He's
			out there looking for mentors.

					ELAINE
			He's got twelve of them.  They're lined
			up.  He's just tired of me.

	A140  INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT						A140

	William holds Penny.  She is very woozy.

					PENNY
			"... you will be required to..."
				(gives up)
			I'm tired.

	She is very groggy, as he holds her.

					WILLIAM
			Well.  Now that I have your attention.
			And you may not remember this later, I
			just want to make it clear that... Hey!
				(she blinks, barely awake
			again)
			I know you've heard this before.  And
			I have never said this to anybody, not
			really - well, nobody who didn't legally
			have to say it back to me, but -
				(tries to be casual)
			I love you.  And I have a hard time
			sharing you with all of rock and roll
			because I - why am I nervous? - You'll
			never remember this - HEY! -
				(she blinks)
			I love you, and I'm about to boldly go
			where...  Many men have gone before...

	He kisses her.  A doctor and nurse come crashing into the room.
	They push past William and pull Penny into the bathroom.  He
	sits on the edge of the bed, looking into the bathroom, as
	they work on her.  We hear Stevie Wonder.  "My Cherie Amor."

	140   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT							140

	Doctor places a tube down Penny Lane's throat.  A bored nurse
	holds a water-bag, lowering it to ground level.

	WILLIAM'S POV INTO BATHROOM

	Her feet sticking out, wriggling.  He watches, as music
	continues.

	ON THE BATHTUB

	Her amber-colored stomach contents look like a Jackson Pollack
	portrait of the era, with three partially dissolved pills.
	Doctor hands enter frame and remove them.  Music continues.

	141   INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT					141

	The Doctor re-appears, and sits down next to William, as the
	Nurse exits.  The Doctor withdraws a three-page report form.

					DOCTOR
			Your wife will be okay for now -

					WILLIAM
			Thank you Doctor.

					DOCTOR
			However, she says you're her brother.

					WILLIAM
				(eyes report)
			She's a little confused.

	The ice shifts in the champagne bucket nearby.  The Doctor
	sizes up the situation.

					DOCTOR
			Nice champagne.

					WILLIAM
			I don't have a driver's license.  With
			me.

					DOCTOR
			Tomorrow's my wedding anniversary.
			I'd prefer to take care of this without
			facing the dawn at the police station.
			So if you can find a way to get this
			girl - your wife - back home to her
			parents, I'd let you pay me anything
			you can afford.  Because you don't
			appear to be related to the famous
			Rugburns of Rhode Island.

	His eyes flick to the champagne.  The kid takes a hint, reaches
	over to the champagne.

					WILLIAM
			Happy Anniversary.

	The Doctor puts the champagne in his bag.

					DOCTOR
			She won't be good company, but keep
			her awake for another four hours.

	142   INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER -- MORNING				142

	Song continues.  William and Penny drag themselves through the
	airport.  He guides her to the ticket counter.  Penny wears
	her green coat, large sunglasses.  He sorts through her many
	partial tickets.  They are both so tired.  She shakes off her
	coat -- she's suddenly very hot -- and he grabs it and loops
	it through her bags.  She's irritable, and ready to go home.

	143   INT. AIRPORT GATE - MORNING					143

					PENNY
				(baring her soul)
			When I was 14, my Mom and her boyfriend
			took me to a Rolling Stones concert -
			and I freaked out and I rushed up to
			the front of the stage and then a
			thousand people had the same idea at
			the same time and I was getting crushed.
			And I couldn't breathe and that thought
			flashed through me - almost like a car
			accident - I thought I might die.  And
			it was in the middle of "Midnight
			Rambler" and Keith Richards saw me.
			And he came over, and came to the front
			of the stage, and he pulled me out.
			And they took me backstage and they
			gave me coke with ice and a - and a
			lemon.  And I never went home.

					WILLIAM
			What about your Mom?

					PENNY
			She always said - "Marry Up." Marry
			someone grand.  That's why she named
			me Lady.

					WILLIAM
				(horrified)
			She named you Lady?

					PENNY
			Lady Goodman.

					WILLIAM
			No.

					PENNY
			You never really get used to it, either.

					WILLIAM
			Well -- this -- this just explains
			everything.

	He wishes it did.  She rubs her stomach.  It's a rocky morning.

					WILLIAM (cont'd)
			See you back in the real world.

					PENNY
			See you back there.

	She kisses his forehead, and takes off down the accordian
	leading to her plane.  She drops her coat again, bending down
	to retrieve it.

					WILLIAM
			Hey Lady!

	Four Woman turn, but not Penny.  She disappears.

	144   INT. AIRPLANE - DAY						144

	Penny Lane settles into her seat on the airplane.  She notices
	William watching from the terminal window, and waves.

					STEWARDESS
			Please extinguish all flammable items,
			and return all seats and tray tables to
			their full and upright locked positions.

	She mouths along with the words.  There is no one to share the
	joke with.  And then a few blurry memories come back to her.
	She gestures to him... understanding him more fully... as he
	disappears.

	145   INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY					145

	William walks alongside her plane, moving from terminal window
	to terminal window.  Catching her glance again, he's picking
	up steam.  What's she saying?

	146   INT. PLANE - DAY							146

	She keeps watching as he runs alongside, still keeping up with
	her plane.  She now fully remembers, and places her outstretched
	fingers on the window.  She mouths the words:   I'll see you
	back home!

	ON WINDOW

	He us running through her fingers.

	CLOSE ON WILLIAM

	Who can run no further.

									FADE OUT

	FADE UP

	147   INT. BAND PLANE -- DAY						147

	Russell and William are in mid-interview.  The kid's microphone
	is out.  It's a little bit of a rough flight.  William wears
	the same clothes.

					RUSSELL
			Why didn't you come back to the party?
			Bob Dylan showed up.  He was sitting
			at our table for... had to be an hour,
			right?  Just  Rapping.  Bob Dylan!  I
			kept looking for you.  I was going to
			introduce you.

	The kid feels pain.

					JEFF
			What happened to you last night?

					WILLIAM
			It's a log story.

	A sharp jolt of turbulence.  Russell begins pounding on the
	card table in rhythm.

					RUSSELL
				(singing Buddy Holly)
			"Peggy Sure... Peggy Sue... "

					DICK
			Please.

					RUSSELL
			"Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy
			Sue... "

	A moment of laughter, and then bam.  Jeff's drink rises and
	suspends briefly in mid-air.  The plane takes another mighty
	knock.

					JEFF
			We shouldn't be here.

					RUSSELL
			Doris, we miss you!

	Fear is creeping in around the edges.  William, already an
	uneasy flier, looks down.

					PILOT'S VOICE
			This is Craig, your pilot.  It appears
			we've caught the edge of that electrical
			storm we were trying to outrun.  Buckle
			up tight now.  We're gonna do our best
			to getcha out of this.

	The rocking of the plane worsens, as all buckle up.

					JEFF
			"Electrical storm?"

					RUSSELL
				(strapping in for a roller
			coaster)
			Rock and roll.

	The sky darkens abruptly. William looks up, increasingly
	nervous, stares straight ahead.  The plane suddenly drops and
	stabilizes.  Everyone is silent but Russell.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Wooooooo Baby!

	A moment later, an ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges, balancing
	himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane.

					CO-PILOT
			We're gonna try to land in Tupelo.
			We're going to have to cut the inside
			lighting for the next several minutes.
			We found a field to land in.

	The kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix.

					DENNIS HOPE
			A field?

					JEFF
			I can't breathe.

	Push in on Russell. We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical
	sounds.  The plane screwballs through the sky.

					CO-PILOT
			It might be a rough set-down.  We should
			be fine.
				(cracking at the edges)
			But what we do say in a situation like
			this is - We would pass but before the
			plane ... disassembled.  However, God
			help us, if there's anything you want
			to say to each other, any secrets,
			anything like that, now would be a
			good time.  But just hang in there.
			We'll get you out of this.

	He returns to the cockpit.  The weather worsens, as the hail
	suddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard.  Inside lights
	shut off.   William stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door
	swings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts again.

					DICK
			And everyone thinks it's so glamorous
			out here.

					LARRY
				(oddly detached)
			He just told us we're gonna die.

					JEFF
				(insecurities running wild)
			We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --

					RUSSELL
			Shut up.

					JEFF
			-- we can't even die in an original
			city!

					RUSSELL
			C'mon Dennis, get us a better city.

	Nervous laughter.  Another sheet of hail hits the plane.

					LESLIE
			Oh my God.

	PUSH IN ON WILLIAM

	Just shaking.  Nearly in tears.   Hyperventilating.

					RUSSELL
			If something should happen.  I love
			all of you.  I don't think we have to
			do the secrets thing.

	The plane shakes.  Now lightening strikes very close.  A
	flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and
	evaporates with a burning smell still in the air.  In the
	darkness:

					DENNIS HOPE
			I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
			A hit-and-run.  I hit him and kept on
			going.  I don't know if he's alive or
			dead, but I'm sorry.

					LESLIE
				(gripped with fear)
			Oh my God.

	The plane wildly rises, and falls.  It stops for a moment.  A
	strange smooth patch.

					DICK
			I love you all too, and you're my
			family.  Especially since Marna left
			me.  But if I ever took an extra dollar
			or two, here and there, it was because
			I knew I'd earned it.

					RUSSELL
			I slept with Marna, Dick.

					JEFF
			I did too.

					LARRY
			I waited until you broke up with her.
			But me too.

					JEFF
			I also slept with Leslie, when you
			were fighting.

					RUSSELL
			You... slept with Jeff?

					LESLIE
			Yes, but it didn't count.  It was the
			summer we decided to be free of all
			rules.

					RUSSELL
				(to Jeff)
			And you say you "love me."

					JEFF
				(the truth)
			I don't love you, man.  I never did.

					RUSSELL
			Please.  Enough.

					JEFF
			NONE of us love you.  You act above
			us.  You ALWAYS HAVE!!

					LARRY
			Finally.  The truth.

					JEFF
			You just held it over us, like you
			light leave... like we're lucky to be
			with you. And we had to live with it.
			I had to live with you, and now I might
			die with you and it's not fucking fair.

	William watches, catatonic.

					RUSSELL
				(to Larry and Ed)
			You hate me?  You too?

	Larry stares at him.  Ed says nothing.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			All this love.  All this loyalty.
				(incredulous, giddy)
			And you don't even like me.

					JEFF
			And I'm still in love with you Leslie.

	Bam.  The plane is pulling sideways, and dropping altitude.

					LESLIE
			I don't want to hear anymore.    Shut
			up! Shut up!  Shut up!

					RUSSELL
				(to Jeff)
			Whatever happens, you're dead.

					JEFF
			Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not
			now.  You were sleeping with Penny,
			that groupie.  Last summer, and up
			until yesterday.  Why don't you tell
			Leslie THAT?

	Russell tries to get up and attack him.  The force keeps him
	in his seat.  He yells.  Loud.

					DENNIS
				(freaking out)
			I quit.

	The turbulence worsens.  William finds his mouth saying
	emotional words he cannot control.

					WILLIAM
			"That groupie?"  She was a Band-Aid.
			All she did was love your band.  And
			you all -- you used her, all of you.
			You used her and threw her away.  She
			almost died last night, while you were
			with Bob Dylan.  You're always talking
			about the fans, the fans, the fans.
			She was your biggest fan and you threw
			her away.  And if you can't see that,
			that's your biggest problem.

	Russell and Jeff stare at each other.   The plane is rocking
	very very hard.  Leslie is crying.

					ED
			I'm gay.

	They all turn to the silent drummer.  (It's his first spoken
	dialogue of the movie.)

	Then.

	The plane pops out from below the clouds.  Sunshine spikes
	through the embattled windows of the plane, as they float
	downwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi.  A very very
	uneasy silence fills the plane.  No one can look at each other.
	Out bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory.

					CO-PILOT
			Thank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!!   WE'RE
			ALIVE!!  WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT!!

	Shot of all the occupants, ending with Russell.  Suddenly, the
	alternative seems far more attractive.  We hear Rod Stewart's
	"Jo's Lament" as music plays over their still-shocked faces.

	148   INT. TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAY				148

	Music continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long
	and very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid.  Everything is
	different now.  The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster.
	We continue with the band, unhappily moving forward.  William
	hustles back to catch up.  They ignore him.  There are much
	bigger thoughts in play.  No one wants to speak.

					JEFF
			Well, I think we can build on this new
			honesty.

	Boom.  Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart.  The
	band continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport
	terminals.  William stops.  This is where he must part company.
	He stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band
	continues, unaware he's split off.   He watches their backs,
	they've forgotten him.

	Then Russell turns, sensing something missing.  William.  All
	now stop and turn.  Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre-
	occupied but heartfelt goodbye.  William waves.  Music
	continues.

	ON AIRPLANE DEPARTURE SCHEDULE

	William's finger finds San Francisco.

	149   INT. CAB -- SAN FRANCISCO -- DAY					149

	The kid checks the address as he arrives at the MJB Building,
	and its next-door neighbor, the San Francisco headquarters of
	Rolling Stone Magazine.  He still wears the same clothes from
	last night in New York.

	150   INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY				150

	William arrives at the front desk, gets the once-over from  a
	friendly RECEPTIONIST, a paragon of new cool.

					RECEPTIONIST
			Leave your package at the desk.

					WILLIAM
			I'm not a messenger.  I'm one of your
			writers.  William Miller.

	He is zombie-tired, with heavy duffel case and his orange bag.

	151   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY					151

	William walks down the center aisle.  Editors and writers look
	at him, standing at the front of their cubicles to see this
	exhausted 15 year-old writer.  At the end of the aisle, like a
	human finish line, stand Ben Fong-Torres.

					BEN
			You're William Miller?

	The secret emerges not with a bang but with a slight and tired
	nod of the head.

					WILLIAM
			Yep.

					BEN
				(putting it all together)
			Oh baby.

	Ben leads him into the office of Jann Wenner, the editor-
	publisher.

	152   INT. JANN WENNER'S OFFICE -- DAY					152

	William sits.  Editors are feverishly discussing the next issue.
	The big concerns of a national magazine are in the air.
	Everyone is focused and quick.  The conversation is machine-
	gun like. Jann Werner turns to the kid.

					JANN
			We can't run this piece.

	The kid's eyes travel to his story -- a stack of fuzzy-looking
	sheets on the table.

					BEN
			You obviously saw more than you wrote
			about.  After eight days on the road
			with these guys.

					DAVID FELTON
			Didn't anything happen?

					JANN
			And where are you in this piece?  What
			did you want to write?  Because this
			reads like what they wanted you to
			write.

					BEN
			What happened to your highly-touted
			think piece on limitations of a middle-
			level Band in the face of success?

	William sits speechless.  It's sinking in.  Failure.
	Conversation continues at a fast pace:

					JANN
			We can push up Chet's Who cover -

					FACT CHECKER
			Good 'cause it's going to take me three
			days to get through this research.
			It's all handwritten, on little slips.
			Plus, they all refer to woman as
			"chicks." I mean, as a woman I have a
			problem with that.  I know it's a side
			issue.

					DAVID FELTON
				(sympathetic, loquacious)
			It's a "puff piece."  you fell for
			'em.  It happens.  A relationship forms.
			You want them to like you.
				(wistful, chewing cigarette
			holder)
			Happened with me and Charlie Manson.
			He was a very charming... lively...
			charismatic...

	Felton catches himself swooning.  The other are staring at
	him.  He snaps out of it.

					DAVID FELTON (cont'd)
			... mass-murderer.

					WILLIAM
			Please let me finish it.  Give me
			tonight to work on it.

					FACT CHECKER
			Chet's piece is all fact-checked and
			ready.

					JANN
				(to William)
			Get some sleep.  We'll do another story
			sometime.  We'll get you a kill fee.

					FACT CHECKER
			His research is all on little bits of
			paper.  Did I say that?

					WILLIAM
			Ben.  You told me to send what I had.
			It's not finished.

					FACT CHECKER
			That's being charitable.

	Ben looks at the kid, then at Jann.  Jann scans the kid's face
	for a beat, nods.

					JANN
			Let him use the big office.   It's
			where Hunter used to write.

	William rises, gratefully.  He shakes Jann's hand.

					FACT CHECKER
				(pointed re: his age)
			You can type.

					WILLIAM
			Yes.  It took it in grade school.

	153   INT. BIG OFFICE -- NIGHT						153

	William sits in the "big" office.  It's a small white tank.
	After all the sound and fury, there is only the hum of a large
	electric typewriter.  His research, transcripts and some band
	photos sit nearby.  He takes a bite of a candy bar, a sip of
	coffee.  He looks at the phone.

	INT. LESTER BANGS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

	Crazy jazz is playing.  Lester Bangs on the phone.

					LESTER BANGS
			Aw, man.  You made friends with them!
			See, friendship is the booze they feed
			you.  They want you to get drunk on
			feeling like you belong.

								 INTERCUT:

	INT. ROLLING STONE -- NIGHT

	William in the empty Rolling Stone office.

					WILLIAM
				(ruefully)
			Well, it was fun.

					LESTER BANGS
			They make you feel cool.  And hey.  I
			met you.  You are not "cool."

					WILLIAM
			I know.  Even when I though I was, I
			knew I wasn't.

					LESTER BANGS
			That's because we are uncool!  And
			while women will always be a problem for
			guys like us, most of the great   art in
			the world is about that very problem.
			Good-looking people have no spine!
			Their art never lasts!  They  get the
			girls, but we're smarter.

					WILLIAM
			I can really see that now.

					LESTER BANGS
			Yeah, great art is about conflict and
			pain and guilt and longing and love
			disguised as sex, and sex disguised as
			love... and let's face it, you got a
			big head start.

					WILLIAM
			I'm glad you were home.

					LESTER BANGS
			I'm always home!  I'm uncool!

					WILLIAM
			Me too!

					LESTER BANGS
				(leveling)
			The only true currency in this bankrupt
			world if what we share with someone
			else when we're uncool.

					WILLIAM
				(distraught)
			I feel better

					LESTER
			My advice to you.  I know you think
			those guys are your friends.  You want
			to be a true friend to them?

	William takes a deep breath.  Looks at the research cassettes and
	notebooks.  The empty page.

					LESTER BANGS
			Be honest and unmerciful.
				(beat)
			You're doing great.  Call me later is
			you want.  I'm always up.

	154   INT. ROLLING STONE OUTER OFFICE -- MORNING			154

	Ben Fong-Torres and David Felton look at William's new
	manuscript with great interest.

					FELTON
			Read me the opening line.

					BEN
				(reads aloud)
			"I am flying high over Tupelo,
			Mississippi, with America's hottest
			band, and we are all about to die."

					FELTON
			Mmmmm.
				(as if sampling wine)
			Dark.  Lively.

					BEN
			Yeah, and it gets better.
				(impressed)
			Did this all really happen?

	William sleeps restlessly nearby, mouth agape, sitting upright
	in a plastic chair.

					FACT CHECKER
				(jealously reaches for
			manuscript)
			Give it to me.  I'll call and check
			the quotes.

	155   INT. NEW TOUR BUS -- DAY						 155

	The band rides in a new tour bus.  The palpable tone in the
	air is -- PANIC.

					JEFF
			Look.  Let's just piece together our
			information...  because the fact-checker
			asked us all about different parts of
			the story.

					TONY
			What did he write about?  What's he
			using?

					JEFF
			It.  All.  He's using it all.

					RUSSELL
			So what?

					JEFF
			So what?
				(beat)
			We come off like amateurs... some
			average band...  trying to come to
			grips, jealous and fighting and breaking
			up - we're buffoons!

					RUSSELL
			Maybe we just don't see ourselves the
			way we really are.

					JEFF
			He was supposed to be our friend.

					RUSSELL
				(ruefully, remembering)
			I told him to write what he wanted.

	All eyes look to Russell.

					TONY
				(to Russell)
			By the way, he has you on acid,
			screaming "I Am A Golden God" from a
			fan's rooftop.

					RUSSELL
				(immediately remembering)
			Oh my God.

					JEFF
			They used him to fuck us.

					RUSSELL
				(still back at "Golden
			God")
			I didn't say "Golden God."  Or did I?

					DICK
			We never took him seriously, and now
			it's serious.

					RUSSELL
			I liked him as a person.

					JEFF
			He was never a "person!"  He was a
			journalist!

	Russell nods.  He looks at Silent Ed, drumming soundlessly on
	a rubber pad.

					RUSSELL
			You.  You had the right idea all along.

	Ed silently nods thanks.

					DENNIS HOPE
				(nervously)
			How about the plane flight?

					DICK
			It's all in there.  But don't worry,
			it's all unspecific who say what.  No
			names are mentioned in the more
			embarrassing sequences, it's just
			completely obvious who's who!  We're
			fucked!

	Silence.

					RUSSELL
			I forgot he was there.

					DENNIS HOPE
			Well, they haven't talked to Russell -
			he can always deny the key stuff to
			the fact checker.  Then they can't
			print it.

					JEFF
				(brightening)
			Is that true?

					DENNIS HOPE
			It's war, my friend.  If you'd met me
			earlier, he would have never been on the
			around.

	Dennis hands Russell the phone.

					DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
			He'll live.

	156   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY					156

	William is still being congratulated by his new peers.  We see
	him woozy but beaming, as Allison the Fact Checker comes out
	of her office, waving the manuscript.  She works her way through
	the cluster of editors.

					FACT CHECKER
			The band just denied 90% of the story.
			It's a fabrication.

	Everyone looks at William, who is speechless and confused.
	Their congratulations stop on a dime.  The fact checker can't
	resist twisting the knife a little.

					FACT CHECKER (cont'd)
			You weren't honest.  And worse, you
			wasted our time.

					WILLIAM
			Did you talk to Russell?

					FACT CHECKER
			Russell Hammond is the one who denied
			it.

					BEN
				(darkly)
			Crazy.

					FACT CHECKER
				(one last shot, to William)
			We're going with the Who - !

	The kid has been sandbagged.  The machine of a big-time magazine
	whirs into action on another story, as the cluster moves down
	the hall.

					SOMEONE'S VOICE
			He's just some fan... what did you
			expect?

	William sits there, as only David Felton stay behind,
	brandishing his cigarette-holder.  He sits down next to the
	kid.

					FELTON
			Well, I believe you.

	He looks at the kid, decides to offer a personal parable.

					FELTON (cont'd)
			Jim Morrison once came to my house and
			drank a beer.  The beer is still on my
			mantle.  I'm 35 years old with Jim
			Morrison's beer as a shrine.  I wanted
			to be Earnest Hemingway.  Instead.  I
			have Jim Morrison's beer.
				(shrugs, he's learned to
			live with it)
			If you didn't make your story up, good
			for you.  If you did make it up... good
			for you.

	The kid looks at him, too tired and still in shock.

					FELTON (cont'd)
			Say something, so I know you're alive.

					WILLIAM
			Goodbye.

	He exits.

					FELTON
			Powerful  word.  Strong.  Final.

	157   INT. BACKSTAGE CREW MEAL - NIGHT					157

	Russell Hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper-plate
	filled with buffet-style food - steak and baked potato.
	Preoccupied, and several seats away from other crew members.
	He drinks a glass of milk.   Out old friend Sapphire takes the
	seat next to him, holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables.

					RUSSELL
			I feel bad.

					SAPPHIRE
			Well, at least you feel.  That puts
			you in a higher class of asshole.

	They eat in silence.  Sapphire looks around.  The new breed of
	groupies eye her, as they cruise Russell on the periphery.
	They're bolder, flashier.  She eyes them back with seniority.

					RUSSELL
			What did I do?

					SAPPHIRE
			Well - you can do what the big boys
			do.
				(he looks at her)
			Nothing.

					RUSSELL
			Yeah.

	The girls still circle Russell nearby.  He's unaware.

					SAPPHIRE
			You believe these new girls?  None of
			'em take birth control, and they eat
			all the steak.

	She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables.  An ever-sharp
	mind in last night's clothes, she commands Russell's respect.

					SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
			They don't even know what it id to be
			a fan!  To blindly love some silly
			piece of music... or some band so much
			that it hurts... please,  they're all
			just after the money.  Shoo --
				(in their direction)
			Go rob a bank!  It's more honest!

					RUSSELL
			Is Penny okay?

					SAPPHIRE
			The Quaalude Incident.  Yeah, it wasn't
			pretty.  She could have died.  I always
			warned her about letting too many guys
			fall in love with her.  I guess I was
			wrong.
				(shrugs)
			On of 'em saved her life.

	Russell nods.

					RUSSELL
			Well, it's finally over with Leslie.
			I'm going to call her.

					SAPPHIRE
			Let her retire.
				(he doesn't respond)
			You want to lock her up in a house in
			Michigan?  Please.
				(he doesn't respond)
			Write her a song someday.  She deserves
			it.  Something about that girl brought
			out the best in a lot of...
				(looks around backstage)
			... pretty average people.  She deserves
			it...

	Russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.

					SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
				(forward thinking)
			... because something tells me twenty
			years from now, we'll remember her...
			and not much else.

	Russell smiles to himself, knows it's true.  Dick passes,
	placing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little.

					DICK
			Have a good vacation.  I hope the band
			stays together.  Before it all went
			down the shitter, it was starting to
			get really good.

	Dick claps Russell on the back, and moves on.  He turns to
	Sapphire.

					RUSSELL
			I'm not going to blame myself.  I do
			make people happy.  They just shouldn't
			get to know me... 'cause it appears to
			spoil everything.

					SAPPHIRE
			Don't be so easy on yourself.

					RUSSELL
			What gives you the right to get this
			personal with me.

					SAPPHIRE
			Let's not reminisce.

	158   INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT -- NIGHT				158

	William moves like a zombie through the airport, and collapses
	in a seat.  He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic.
	A cluster of Flight Attendants pass.  One stops, a stylish young
	woman wearing a tall bubble-shaped PSA hat with swirling colors.

					ANITA
			William?

	He looks at her.  He feels like he's on Mars, and she looks
	like a Martian.

					ANITA (cont'd)
			You guys this is my brother!

					MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
				(ad if meeting a celebrity)
			"The Narc?!"

	William looks woefully at them, like a dog who's been hit by a
	car.

					ANITA
			You guys, I'll deadhead back later.  I
			think I'm needed.

					MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
			Nice to finally meet you.

					FEMALE ATTENDANT
			You have a good day!

	Anita looks in her brother's face.

					ANITA
			You look awful, but that's great.
			You're living your life!  You're finally
			free of... her.

					WILLIAM
			Yeah.

					ANITA
			Hey.  I'll take off work.  Let's have
			an adventure together.  You and me,
			finally.  Anywhere you want to go.
			Anywhere in the world.

	159   EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- DAY					159

	William whistles the family whistle.  Sister and brother trudge
	up the steps.

					ANITA
			This is not my idea of a good time.

					WILLIAM
			Just get me to my bed.

					ANITA
				(resigned)
			I'll deal with her.

	William whistles again.  Mom meets them at the door.  She looks
	at her trashed son who has finally come home.  For the first
	time, she hugs Anita first, and it's not lost on Anita.

	It's a clumsy neck-hug, neither wanting to commit.  The kid
	passes to his Mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally
	nudging her into his sister.  Anita takes this as an aggressive
	act of love, and hugs her mother back.  Tears stream down Mom's
	face.  Their cheeks touch. Mom pulls away, and sees her own
	tears on Anita's face.  Thinking that she's also crying, she
	grabs a tissue for them both.

	160   INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS					160

	The kid stands in the hallway listening, shaking his head,
	poised to enter his room, unseen by them.

					ANITA
				(so worried)
			What are we going to do about him?

					ELAINE
			I don't know.  Whatever happened to him, I
			just wish it could have happened to me.

					ANITA
			The magazine killed his story.

	Now they really hug, Anita gulping back real tears.  William
	watches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure.
	William goes into the bedroom, the final three feet to sleep,
	and shuts the door.  A hand places a hotel sign on the door -
	DO NOT DISTURB.  Slight push in.

	ON BED

	He collapses with all his clothes on, almost instantly asleep.  His
	walls, just as he left them, boast a pantheon of rock heroes...
	with a very lonely Abraham Lincoln (or Atticus Finch)  in the center.

	161   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY					161

	The elevator doors ding open, and out walks Russell Hammond.
	The Secretary has just finished answering the phone, "Straight
	Arrow Publishers."  She puts the caller on hold.

					RUSSELL
			Hi, I'm Russel Hammond.

					SECRETARY
			You're here regarding?

					RUSSELL
			My life.

	162   INT. EDITORIAL OFFICE - DAY					162

	Russell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits
	on the walls.  He's behind enemy lines, and he knows it.
	Everything in the room fascinates him.

					RUSSELL
			I don't care what happens.  I don't
			care if you put us on the cover.  But
			you sent us a kid and... and he was a
			fan.   And we all made friends with
			him - absolutely, to get a good story.
			But then we actually liked him.  We
			thought he's... show us our lives in
			some mythic way and I guess... we're
			not mythic.  We panicked.

					JANN
			You denied most of the story.

					RUSSELL
			Yeah, well, here's the problem with
			the truth.  It's too true -

					BEN
			Well, we appreciate the visit.  The
			last time an artist came here, it was
			Buddy Miles and he punched me.

					RUSSELL
			I'm not punching anybody.  I am
			personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a
			voyage of self-reinvention.  This is
			about William Miller.
				(counting off fingers)
			He lives with us, he lost his virginity,
			he saw us at our worst, appreciated
			our best, he saved two lives, including
			mine... he smuggled about a half-pound
			of pot into Boston, and we never even
			told him -

	Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an
	eyebrow.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			-- we told him too much, we told him
			everything...  He almost died with us
			over Tupelo... if the band survives
			him, it'll be a miracle... but you
			know, he tried to keep up, and that's
			a journalist to me.

					JANN
			It's too late.  We're going with a
			different cover.

					RUSSELL
				(immediately)
			Thank God.

	But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead
	legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of
	them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin.  A second thought.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			You tell me it's too late.  But I could
			go back to my hotel room and... and
			O.D. tonight and something tells me
			you'd find a way to put me on the cover
			of the next issue.  Am I right?

	He looks at their faces.  They cannot disagree.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			I'm learning the game.
				(beat, shrug)
			We fucked up.  We made friends with him.

					BEN
			Next time we'll all be more
			professional.

					RUSSELL
			Maybe so.
				(beat, an odd thought)
			But God forbid, the day comes when
			selling yourself is as important as
			the music you make.
				(rueful, to Hendrix on the
			wall)
			You might have died at the right time,
			my friend.

					JANN
			Thank you for visiting.  Good luck.

					RUSSELL
			Do what you want, but the story is
			true.

	LONG SHOT RUSSELL

	at the entrance.  Raises his hand.

					RUSSELL (cont'd)
			Good evening!

	162A  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY						162A

	Russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go.
	Oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to
	speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a
	music of its own.  It's a beautiful and compelling "silence."
	He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath
	of life.  His head filling again with the music of the world,
	he begins to walk down the street.  Very naturally, and quite
	randomly, he is noticed by young passersby.  They can't help
	it.  He looks like a star.  They can't quite figure out who it
	is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the
	street.   Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought,
	a small crowd begins to form... following him.

	163   INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY					163

	A quiet kitchen.  Anita has been cooking.  A substantial
	breakfast has been placed on the table.  Sausage, orange
	juice... and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with
	syrup and butter, in front of her mother.  William watches his
	mother facing an old enemy - white sugar.

					ANITA
			They're called pancakes.  Who knows
			when we'll be together again.  Splurge.
			It's what most people call breakfast.

	Mom looks at her children, and takes a breath.

					ELAINE
			I went through your records.  And I
			found a song to play for you.

	She goes to the stereo and puts on a record.  The two children
	eye each other - what's coming next?  (Song to be chosen)
	The two kids eye each other again.  Self-consciously avoiding
	their gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast.  It's a song
	she clearly wants them to hear.  It's a song from the heart.
	They look at her, amazed.  Elaine looks up, regards her family.
	Somehow they're back at this table.  They continue eating
	breakfast.

	164   ON SIDEWALK							164

	Bam.  A bundle of bound Rolling Stone Magazines lands on the
	newsstand pavement with a thud.  Someone reaches in to cut the
	cord, as the magazines puff up into view.  It's the new issue,
	with Russell Hammond on the cover.  The title: Stillwater Runs
	Deep.  Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in
	the racks.

	Music segues to Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks."  Penny Lane's

	MAIN TITLES END ON


	EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come
	over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
	before we

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY

	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private
	elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.

				AGENT COOPER
		Liberty's moving.

	Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is
	followed a step or two later by

	PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.

	SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,
	professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.

				JANIE
		The 10:15 event's been moved inside
		to the Indian Treaty Room.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to Janie)
		The 10:15 is American Fisheries?

				JANIE
		Yes, sir. They're giving you a
		200-pound halibut.

				SHEPHERD
		Janie, make a note. We need to
		schedule more events where somebody
		gives me a really big fish.

	JANIE starts to make a note.

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Janie, I was kidding.

				JANIE
		Of course, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		       (to the AGENT at the
		        elevator)
		Hey, Cooper.

				AGENT COOPER
		'Morning, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...

				JANIE
		Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
		with you this morning.

				SHEPHERD
		Is he upset about the speech last night?

				JANIE
		He seemed concerned.

				SHEPHERD
		Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
		unless Lewis was concerned about
		something I did Sunday night.

	The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,
	LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It
	would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,
	though that doesn't seem to slow him down.

				LEWIS
		You skipped the whole paragraph.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to Janie)
		And Monday morning it is.

	LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
	double doors leading to the South Lawn.

				LEWIS
		"American can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society"...and then nothing. You
		dumped the whole handguns paragraph.

				SHEPHERD
		This is a time for prudence, Lewis.

				LEWIS
		That was the kick-ass section.

	The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
	the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
	Wing.

				SHEPHERD
		I thought what with being the
		President and all...

				LEWIS
		Sir, of course I didn't mean to
		imply--

				SHEPHERD
		I thought you'd be turning cartwheels
		this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job
		approval.

				LEWIS
		That's great news, sir, but...

	They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.

				GROUNDKEEPER
		'Morning, Mr. President.

	Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,
	JANIE quickly and quietly said--

				JANIE
		Charlie.

				SHEPHERD
		'Morning, Charlie.

				LEWIS
		Sir, the press is gonna need an
		explanation.

				SHEPHERD
		For what?

	SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
	open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make
	their way through the corridors of


	INT. THE WEST WING - DAY

	They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES
	AND OFFICE WORKERS.

				LEWIS
		Because you dropped the whole kick-ass
		section, now we've got this thing hanging
		out there.

				SHEPHERD
		There's a thing hanging out there?

				LEWIS
		"Americans can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society." Then ...nothing. No
		explanation. No context. So now it's
		just this thing.

				SHEPHERD
		And it's hanging out there?

				LEWIS
		Yes, sir.

	SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--

				SHEPHERD
		Maria--

				STAFFER (MARIA)
		Good morning, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Did they tell you I'm gonna need--

				STAFFER (MARIA)
		--overall consumer spending and not
		just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have
		it for you in 15 minutes.

				SHEPHERD
		Thanks.

	SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.

				LEWIS
		Mr. President, I really feel we need
		to focus on...

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis, however much coffee you drink
		in the morning, I want you to reduce it
		by half.

				LEWIS
		I don't drink coffee.

				SHEPHERD
		Then hit yourself over the head with
		a baseball bat, would you please?

	Another STAFFER crosses their path--

				JANIE
		Happy birthday, Laura.

				SHEPHERD
		Hey, Laura, happy birthday.

				STAFFER (LAURA)
		Thank you, sir.

	Once out of earshot--

				SHEPHERD
			(to JANIE)
		I should send her some flowers.

				JANIE
		You already did, sir.

	And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into


	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,
	is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD
	walks in--

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Good morning, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		How're you, Mrs. Chapil?

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left
		the detailed breakdown of the approval
		poll for you. He seemed to indicate that
		it was very good news.

				SHEPHERD
		Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

	And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has
	gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
	briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used
	to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,
	listening, and talking at the same time.

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Lucy called just a moment ago. You
		forgot to sign her permission slip
		for her class--

				JANIE
		--the museum trip. I'll go get it.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to JANIE)
		What time does she get home today?

				JANIE
		Three-twenty.

				SHEPHERD
		How's my afternoon look?

				JANIE
		Very crowded.

				SHEPHERD
		Schedule some time for me at 3:30.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.

	This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the
	President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.

				SHEPHERD
		Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico?

				ROBIN
		I didn't truly appreciate it until I
		came back and discovered that America
		isn't a great society.

				LEWIS
			   (to ROBIN)
		He dumped a whole section.

				SHEPHERD
		Now there's a thing hanging out there.

				ROBIN
		Not a great society, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		Well, with you out of the country, it
		wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,
		we're great again.

				ROBIN
		There's a press room full of people
		saying "What did he mean by that?"

				LEWIS
		See?

				SHEPHERD
			   (re: a memo he's been
			    looking at)
		A.J., did you get one of these?

	This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a
	separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition
	to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,
	he's the President's closest and oldest friend.

				A.J.
		Is that the letter from Solomon at
		the GDC?

				SHEPHERD
		It would appear to be a letter from
		the entire environmental community.
		These people are outta control.

				A.J.
		I think they're just frustrated,
		Mr. President.

				ROBIN
		Are they blaming the President for
		global warming?

				A.J.
		Well, they don't think he caused it,
		if that's what you mean.

			   (continuing;
			    to SHEPHERD)
		Sir, I'm on the phone with these
		people twice a week. I honestly
		don't know what they want at this
		point.

				LEWIS
		What they want is a 20 percent reduction in
		fossil fuel emissions.

				A.J.
		It won't pass at 20 percent.

				LEWIS
		We haven't really tried.

				A.J.
		Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
		hold too many markers. If we try to
		push this through and lose, there will
		be a very loud thud when we hit the
		ground, and that's not what you want in
		an election year.

				SHEPHERD
		Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
		the President resents the implication
		that he's turned his back on the
		environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
		the floor. But we're gonna ask for a
		10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
		their support, fine. At 63 percent job
		approval rating. I don't need their help
		getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--
		where's Leon?

				A.J.
			   (to an AIDE)
		Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him
		the President's--

	A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
	pedestrian collision in the outer office--

				MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)
		Aaagh!

				KODAK (O.S.)
		Sorry! Sorry, my fault.

				A.J.
			   (to the AIDE)
		Never mind.

	LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House
	pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along
	with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's
	Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close
	over the past few years.

				KODAK
		Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		You all right?

				KODAK
		They keep moving that big ficus plant.

				A.J.
		We're all here, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		Okay. First, I wanted to say
		congratulations. Three years ago, we
		were elected to the White House by
		one of the narrowest margins in history,
		and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
		registered voters think we're doing a
		good job.

				KODAK
		Wait a second. You wanted me to poll
		registered voters?

	Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...

				SHEPHERD
		But the poll also tells us what we
		already knew: We don't get this
		crime bill of ours through Congress
		and these numbers are gonna be a
		memory. So, starting today, we're
		shifting it into gear.

				ROBIN
		Can I tell my morning press gaggle
		that gun control--

				A.J.
		Crime control, Robin. Gun control
		means we're wimps and we're soft on
		crime.

				LEWIS
		Hang on, are we not--

				A.J.
		Lewis--

				LEWIS
		Are we not putting back the handgun
		restrictions?!

				A.J.
		We're leaving 'em out.

				LEWIS
		Sir, we campaigned on this issue.
		Now, I understand we took it out when
		we were in the low forties, but we
		can push it through now.

				SHEPHERD
		After the elections.

				LEWIS
		Sir, we may never have an opportunity
		like this again. Let's take this 63
		percent out for a spin and see what
		it can do.

				SHEPHERD
		We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
		We need it to get re-elected. For
		reasons passing understanding, people
		do not relate guns to gun-related crime.

				A.J.
		Robin, you can brief the press this
		afternoon. As of today, the crime
		bill's priority one on the President's
		domestic agenda.

				ROBIN
		Got it.

				A.J.
		Leon, you're gonna run the war room.
		We're gonna need detailed projections
		for all the target districts by the
		end of the week. And, Leon, don't be
		a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
		what the N.R.A. does.

				KODAK
		Scare the shit out of 'em?

				A.J.
		Yeah.

				KODAK
		I can do that.

				A.J.
		Lewis, we want you to be legislative
		liaison on this. You're gonna run
		the show on the hill.

				LEWIS
		Can I just say, to return to the
		subject for one moment, that it might
		be easier to fight a war on drugs if
		we weren't arming drug dealers.

	SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
	temper.

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights
		we can win.

				LEWIS
		Yes, sir.

				A.J.
		We want to announce the crime bill at
		the State of the Union, which is 72
		days from today. The last nose count
		put us 18 votes short.

				SHEPHERD
		Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you,
		everyone. Janie, what's next?

				A.J.
		Thank you, Mr. President.

	The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank
	you, Mr. President"'s as they exit.

				JANIE
		Security briefing, sir.

	LEO, a white-haired man in his early 60's is meeting with

	to create an issue where none exists.

				SUSAN
		Did the President read the letter?

				LEO
		The President's pissed as hell,
		Susan. That letter was a stupid move.

				SUSAN
		It was aggressive, and we should
		stand by every--

				LEO
		This isn't the guy who needed us four
		years ago, Susan. He's incredibly
		popular. He's gonna win re-election
		in a walk, and he could give a shit
		what we stand by! If the President
		passes the most important piece of
		environmental legislation in history,
		and does it despite our negative
		endorsement, our political weight in
		the future will rank somewhere below

				SUSAN
		We don't need another environmental
		expert to confirm what every other
		environmental expert--

				LEO
		Not an environmental expert, a
		professional political strategist.
		We're playing hardball with Andrew
		Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.

				SUSAN
		Who?

				LEO
		Sydney Ellen Wade.

				SUSAN
		Oh Christ. That woman doesn't know

		Mr. President, your cousin Judith's

				SHEPHERD
		That's too bad. Remind me to give
		her a call later.

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				ROBIN
		You gonna go stag?

				SHEPHERD
		That's not a problem.

				ROBIN
		No. We've never gone wrong parading
		you around as the lonely widower.

	The words came out casually, but they instantly freeze everyone.

		My God.

	LUCY, Shepherd's 12-year-old daughter, stops playing.

				SHEPHERD
		No, keep going. I liked what you
		were playing? What's it called?

				LUCY
		Scales.

				SHEPHERD
		Well... you play it with gusto!

				LUCY
		Are my lips swollen?

				SHEPHERD
		Are they supposed to be?

				LUCY
		Yeah.

				SHEPHERD
		Then you're doing fine.

				LUCY
		Whatcha got behind your back?

				SHEPHERD
		A little gift.

				LUCY
		Is it a dirt bike?

				SHEPHERD
		Nope.

	He hands her an old textbook ...

				LUCY
		Is it a really old seventh-grade
		textbook of yours that you're gonna
		make me read cover to cover and
		discuss at dinner and drive me crazy
		with?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm not comfortable with the "really
		old" part, but everything else you
		said was true.

				LUCY
			   (reading the cover)
		"Understanding the Constitution."

				SHEPHERD
		Your social studies teacher said your
		class would be starting on the
		Constitution this week.

				LUCY
		You talked to Mr. Linder?

				SHEPHERD
		Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher
		Conference. Mr. Linder and I were
		the key player in that discussion.
		Why don't you like social studies,
		Luce?

				LUCY
		I like it fine, Dad.

				SHEPHERD
		All your other teachers say you're
		happy, you're enthusiastic, you've
		always got your hand up...Mr. Linder
		says you don't participate unless he
		calls on you, and even then it's a
		one-word answer.

				LUCY
		I don't know what to say, Dad. I
		guess I'm just not...I don't know.

				SHEPHERD
		Luce, take a look at this book. This
		is exciting stuff. It's about who we
		are and what we want. Read what it
		says on the first page.

				LUCY
			   (reading)
		"Property of Gilmore Junior High
		School."

				SHEPHERD
		The next page.

				LUCY
			   (reading)
		"We, the People, of the United States,
		in order to form a more perfect union..."

				SHEPHERD
		See? Grabs you right off the bat.
		It's a page-turner.

				LUCY
		I can't wait.

				SHEPHERD
		Good, 'cause it's possible the subject
		might come up at dinner tonight.

				LUCY
		Do you see it as part of your job to
		torture me?

				SHEPHERD
		No, it's just one of the perks. See
		you tonight.

	He gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door.
	Behind him, he hears Lucy's rendition of "Hail to the Chief."
	SHEPHERD shoots her a look as we

	SECRETARY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS and a NATIONAL
	SECURITY ADVISOR, each of whom is accompanied by at least one
	DEPUTY or AIDE. A.J. is also present.

				DEFENSE SECRETARY
		The C-STAD hardware's been in place
		for a month. We've got 22 instructors
		from the Army Air Defense School waiting
		to go down and train the Israelis.

				A.J.
		How soon can you deploy them?

				CHAIRMAN
		We can airlift 'em in the morning.
		They'll have C-STAD operational in 20
		days.

				A.J.
		Any security concerns?

				SECURITY ADVISOR
		If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd
		have hit it by now.

				SHEPHERD
		Okay. Let's move on it. Thank you,
		gentlemen.

	SHEPHERD and A.J. leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of
	"good-bye" 's and "Thank you, Mr. President"'s.
	They pass MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE.

				SHEPHERD

		Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil.

				MRS. CHAPIL
		You too, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD starts his walk from the West Wing back to the

	It is the exact reverse of the path he took to the OVAL OFFICE
	in the morning.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll see you in the morning, Janie.

				JANIE
		You will, Mr. President.

	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT follows at a distance.

				AGENT #2
			   (sotto)
		Liberty is moving.

				A.J.
		Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun

				SHEPHERD
		It's about time.

				A.J.
		She's a lawyer from Virginia named
		Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman
		well. She's had a lot of success
		getting congressmen elected.

				SHEPHERD
		Maybe we should try to steal her.
		Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them
		leave the room till they're clear
		about that.

				A.J.
		You know, if you've got a free second,
		maybe you could stop in and say hello.
		It might smooth the way.

				SHEPHERD
		Mention it to Janie.

				A.J.
		Good.

				SHEPHERD
		Then let's clear this off the table
		and get everybody focused on the
		crime bill. I don't want to win
		this. I want to win it by a couple of
		touchdowns.

				A.J.
		We will, Mr. President.

		              SHEPHERD
		Good.

	A.J. starts to leave. SHEPHERD stops him.

		A.J.?

				A.J.
		Yes?

				SHEPHERD
		Listen, Robin said something to me
		today that I'm sure she wouldn't have

		it to me, I realize...
			   (beat)
		Ah, never mind. Have a good night.

				A.J.
		Good night, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		A.J., when we're out of the office
		and we're alone, you can call me Andy.

				A.J.
		I beg your pardon?

				SHEPHERD
		I mean you were the best man at my
		wedding, for crying out loud. Call

				A.J.

		Whatever you say, Mr. President.

	They have reached the south entrance to the White House.

	SUSAN hands the guard her license.

				SYDNEY

		I'm from Virginia.

				SUSAN
		He doesn't care.

				SYDNEY

				SUSAN
		He doesn't need to know that.

	The GUARD BUZZES her through the gate.

				SYDNEY

		Forgive me, this is my first time at

				SUSAN
		He doesn't know what Capra-esque

				SHEPHERD
		Ahead?

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD

		Janie, this is unprecedented. I don't

				JANIE
		Mr. MacInerney asked me to remind you

		The GDC meeting. Right.

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY

				A.J.
		Your concerns are not falling on deaf
		ears. The environmental lobby has
		known no greater alley in the White
		House than President Shepherd.

				SYDNEY
		Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.

	SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable--

				SUSAN
		Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney
		alone now. He's already given us more
		time than--

				SYDNEY
		Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want
		us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's
		not yet done what he needs to do today.

				SUSAN
		Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the
		deep end of the pool on her first day.
		She hasn't even had a chance to read
		the report of the Quebec Conference.

	SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes,
	check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides,
	instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching
	this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.

				SYDNEY
		You're right. I haven't read it. If
		someone had asked me yesterday, I'd
		have told them the Quebec Conference
		was made up of six professional hockey
		teams. But what I do know is that it's
		time for the President to run for
		president again. Leon Kodak is as good
		as it gets when it comes to electoral
		strategy, and I'm certain he's told the
		President exactly what I'd tell him:
		Nail down Michigan and California,
		where they make cars and airplanes --
		and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if
		I had read these eight hundred pages,
		I would have discovered that it's the
		burning of fossil fuels that's been
		mostly responsible for global warming and
		that the 20 percent reduction recommended
		by the GDC is a necessary first step
		toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
		effect that has gone unchecked by this
		administration...

				SUSAN
			   (to SYDNEY)
		It's really time to--

				SYDNEY
		Susan, I promise you, the White House
		Chief of Staff will not let us leave
		here until he's broken the bad news.

	No one in the room really understands what's going on...
	except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire
	SYDNEY but, of course, can't.

				A.J.
			   (pause)
		I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although
		not about Michigan and California.
		The President has asked me to convey
		to you that he's sending his energy
		bill to the floor with a call for a
		reduction of 10 percent.

	There's an uncomfortable silence in the room...

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		The President is willing to go it
		alone on this, but he's asking for,
		and frankly he's expecting, the full
		support of the GDC.

				SYDNEY
		The President's expecting our full
		support?

				A.J.
		Yes, he is.

				SYDNEY
		The President's dreamin', A.J.

				SUSAN
		Sydney!

				SYDNEY
		--the President has critically
		misjudged reality. If he honestly
		thinks that the environmental
		community is going to whistle a
		happy tune while rallying support
		around this pitifully lame mockery of
		environmental leadership just because
		he's a nice guy and he's done better
		than his predecessors, then your boss
		is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Let's take him out back and beat the
		shit out of him.

	SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the
	direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in
	person, The President of the United States.

	She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought
	process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on
	her head right now.

				A.J.
		Good morning, Mr. President. How are
		you today?

				SHEPHERD
		Couldn't be better.
			   (to the GROUP)
		I apologize for the interruption, but
		A.J. asked me to stop and say hello.
		You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by
		any chance, would you?

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, I'm...don't know what
		to say. I'm speechless.

				SHEPHERD
		All evidence to the contrary.

				SUSAN
		Mr. President, we haven't met. My
		name is Susan Sloan. I used to work
		with Congressman Myers. I hope this
		episode in no way--

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney?

				SYDNEY
		Yes, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		You got a second?

				SYDNEY
			   (quietly)
		Of course.

	SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s
	office and into the hallway.

				SHEPHERD
		I thought maybe we might have a word
		in private. Someplace a little less
		intimidating.
			   (calling)
		Janie?

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to SYDNEY)
		This is my personal assistant, Janie
		Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms.
		Wade into the rec room. I'll be there
		in a second.

	SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues
	down the hallway.

				JANIE
			   (to SYDNEY)
		This way...

	JANIE leads SYDNEY into...


	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing
	whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper
	on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to
	notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of
	the United States, the bust of Lincoln...

	SHEPHERD strides in--

				SHEPHERD
		Sorry to keep you waiting.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President--

				SHEPHERD
		Is it okay if I call you Sydney?

				SYDNEY
		Of course. Mr. President--

				SHEPHERD
		Have you ever been in the Oval Office?

				SYDNEY
		I've just been on the regular tour.
		It didn't include...

				SHEPHERD
		I hear it's pretty good.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, what you saw in there
		was nothing more than vanity run amok.
		I was showing off for a colleague who
		doesn't think very much of me. It'd
		be a real injustice for you to hold the
		GDC accountable for my behavior today.
		On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry
		for having insulted you like that.

				SHEPHERD
		Are you under the impression that I'm
		mad at you?

				SYDNEY
			   (pause)
		Well...

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, seldom does a day go by that
		I'm not burned in effigy.

				SYDNEY
		Not by a professional political
		operative standing 30 feet from the
		Oval Office.

				SHEPHERD
		No, I'll give you that.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President--

				SHEPHERD
		Did you know that when the City
		Planners sat down to design
		Washington, D.C., their intention was
		to build a city that would intimidate
		and humble foreign heads of state?
		It's true.

				SYDNEY
		I didn't know that.


				SHEPHERD
		The White House has the single
		greatest home court advantage in the
		modern world.

				SYDNEY
		Learned that one the hard way.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, this bill is important to me.

				SYDNEY
		Yes, sir, I'll convey your message.

				SHEPHERD
		But you don't believe me?

				SYDNEY
		The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
		It's a long shot at 10.

				SYDNEY
		How do you know that until you put
		the full weight of the White House
		behind--

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes
		shy in the House. It can't be done.
		But I tell you what. I'll make you a
		deal with you. If you can get 24
		votes, I'll get you the last 10.

				SYDNEY
		Twenty-four votes?

				SHEPHERD
		If you can swing 24 votes by the
		State of the Union, I'll promise you
		full White House support.

				SYDNEY
		Do I have your word on that, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry?
		I skipped breakfast. You wanna have
		some coffee? A donut or something?

				SYDNEY
		Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my
		surroundings, and yes, I've gotten
		off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
		beginning, but don't let that
		diminish the weight of my message:
		The GDC has been at every president
		for the last decade and a half that
		global warming is a calamity, the
		effects of which will be second only
		to nuclear war. The best scientists
		in the world have given you every
		reason to take the GDC seriously.
		But I'm gonna give you one more. If
		you don't live up to the deal you
		just made, come New Hampshire, we're
		gonna go shopping for a new candidate.

	SYDNEY heads for the door--

				SHEPHERD
		You can't do that, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		With all due respect, Mr. President,
		who's gonna stop me?

				SHEPHERD
		Well, if you go through that door,
		the United States Secret Service.
		That's my private office.
			      (pointing)
               You need to go out that way.

				SYDNEY
			   (beat)
		Ah.

	SYDNEY, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the
	Oval Office. SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired.

	stands to the side with his pool cue.

				A.J.
		McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know
		we're making our move on the crime
		bill. They're circling the wagons on
		the assault weapons.

				SHEPHERD
		Should I meet with them?

				A.J.
		Let Lewis take a pass at them first.

				SHEPHERD
		Fine. 2 in the side.

	SHEPHERD sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket.

				A.J.
		Nice shot, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't
		call me by my name when we're playing
		pool.

	A.J. assesses the table.

				A.J.
		I will not do it playing pool, I will
		not do it in a school, I do not like
		green eggs and ham, I do not like
		them Sam I am.

				SHEPHERD
		At ease, A.J., and get away from the
		pocket. 9 in the corner.

	SHEPHERD makes the shot.

				A.J.
		Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was
		thrilled with the deal you made this
		morning.

	SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it
	there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.

				SHEPHERD
		I forgot to tell you.

				A.J.
		It's a waste of time.

				SHEPHERD
		Not our time. GDC makes a big
		push for the votes, and when they
		come up short, we move in with the
		softer bill, to get passed, we're
		everybody's hero. 3 in the side.

				A.J.
		Also, Sydney Wade called.

	SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney Wade?

				A.J.
			   (beat)
		She wanted to apologize one more time
		for her behavior. 3 in the side.

				SHEPHERD
		Did she say anything about me?

				A.J.
			   (beat)
		Sydney Wade?

				SHEPHERD
		When she called.

				A.J.
		Did she say anything about you?
		13 in the corner.

				SHEPHERD
		No, it's just that we had a nice
		couple of minutes together. She
		threatened me and I patronized her
		and we didn't have anything to eat,
		but I thought there was a connection.

	A.J. is staring at him in disbelief.

				SHEPHERD
		She didn't say anything about me?

				A.J.
			(quietly)
		Well, no, but I could pass her a note
		before study hall and--

				SHEPHERD
		Tell me this: Hypothetically, what
		would happen--

				A.J.
		I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in
		the corner.

	He misses the shot.

				SHEPHERD
		--if I called Sydney and asked her
		to be my date at the State Dinner
		Thursday night?

				A.J.
		You're not serious.

				SHEPHERD
		Don't I sound serious?

				A.J.
		The President can't just go out on
		a date.

				SHEPHERD
		Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.

				A.J.
		You're not--

				SHEPHERD
		Wilson was widowed during his first
		term. He meets a woman named Edith
		Gault. He dated her, courted her,
		married her, and somewhere in there
		managed to form the League of Nations.

				A.J.
		Mr. President, this is an election
		year. If you're looking for female
		companionship, we can make
		arrangements that'll insure total
		privacy and--

				SHEPHERD
		I don't want you to get me a girl,
		A.J. What is this, Vegas?

				A.J.
		No, sir, this is the White House.

				SHEPHERD
		And I'm talking about something
		that in no way is at conflict with
		my oath of office. I'm a single
		adult, and I met a woman that I'd
		like to see again socially. How's
		that different from what Wilson did?

				A.J.
		The difference is he didn't have to
		be the president on television.
		You've said it a million times:
		If there were a television set in every
		living room 60 years ago, this country
		does not elect a man in a wheelchair.

				SHEPHERD
		What are you saying?

				A.J.
		We'll take a hit.

				SHEPHERD
		How big?

				A.J.
		I don't know. Five points. Maybe
		more.

				SHEPHERD
		Five points we're standing here
		talking about?!

				A.J.
		It could be more.

				SHEPHERD
		I drop five points when Wisconsin
		doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl.
		5 in the corner.

				A.J.
		Do you want me to have Kodak put
		together some numbers so we know
		what we're talking about?

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah.
			   (beat)
		No. No. I don't want to check a
		polling sample to see if this is
		okay, like I'm asking permission
		to stay out an hour past curfew.
		This isn't the business of the
		American people.

				A.J.
		Mr. President, the American people
		have a funny way of deciding on
		their own what is and what is not
		their business.

				SHEPHERD
		I like her, A.J.
			   (pause)
		Stop being my chief of staff for one
		minute.

				A.J.
			   (beat)
		Give her a call.

				SHEPHERD
			   (calling out)
		Janie!
			   (to A.J.)
		She didn't say anything about me?

				A.J.
		She said you're taller than she
		thought you'd be.

				SHEPHERD
		That's something.

	JANIE enters--

				JANIE
		Yes, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		I need you to track down a phone
		number.

	INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as
	evidence that SYDNEY's staying with her sister BETH
	temporarily.

	BETH, still in hospital scrubs from a 12-hour shift, opens a
	bottle of wine while SYDNEY, in a bathrobe and wet hair,
	tries to get off the phone.

				SYDNEY
			   (into phone)
		Richard...Richard, it wasn't funny.
		I acted like a college freshman at a
		protest rally.

				BETH
		Tell him the part about walking out
		the wrong door.

				SYDNEY
		Oh God, I forgot about that.
			   (back into phone)
		No, Richard...Richard, I don't want
		to hear your Andrew Shepherd imitation...

				BETH
		I wanna hear it.

				SYDNEY
		I'm hanging up now, Richard...
		Tonight? I was gonna go to bed early
		and wake up when there's a new
		president.

	She hangs up.

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing)
		The President must think I'm a third-
		rate jerk.

				BETH
		If he thinks you're a jerk, I'm sure
		he thinks you're a first-rate jerk.

				SYDNEY
		I'll tell you one thing, boy. I
		regrouped, you gotta gimme that.
		I pulled it together at the end. I
		stood in the middle of the Oval
		Office and I made it very clear that
		from now on, he who doesn't take the
		GDC seriously does so at his peril!

				BETH
		And then you walked out the wrong
		door.

				SYDNEY
		Are you gonna be throwing that back
		at me the rest of my life?

				BETH
		That's my current plan, yes.

	The TELEPHONE RINGS...

				SYDNEY
		That's gonna be Leo Solomon. He said
		he'd call at nine.

	SYDNEY picks up the phone--

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing;
			    into phone)
		Hello?

				SHEPHERD
		Uh, hi, is this Sydney?

	SYDNEY doesn't recognize the voice--

				SYDNEY
			   (into phone)
		Leo?

				PHONE VOICE
		No, this is Andrew Shepherd.

	SYDNEY looks at BETH and rolls her eyes, then explains to
	her--

				SYDNEY
		Andrew Shepherd.
			   (back in the phone)
		You're hilarious, Richard. You're a
		regular riot.

	And we CROSS-CUT between SYDNEY and SHEPHERD.

				SHEPHERD
		Uhh...this isn't Richard, it's Andrew
		Shepherd.

				SYDNEY
		Oh, really. Well, I'm so glad you
		called, because I forgot to tell
		you today what a nice ass you have.
		I'm also impressed that you were able
		to get my phone number, considering
		I don't have a phone. Good night,
		Richard.

	SYDNEY hangs up the phone.

		Are you learning-impaired?!

				SYDNEY
			   (beat)
		What?

				SHEPHERD
		Hang up the phone. Then dial 456-1414.

	SYDNEY's still holding the phone and seems a little

				SYDNEY
			   (to herself)
		This isn't happening to me.

	She dials.

				BETH
		What's going on?

				SYDNEY

		The President's expecting your call,

	INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

	He's just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings.
	He picks up the phone--

				SHEPHERD
		Hello.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, I'm sure there's an
		appropriate thing to say at this
		moment. Probably some formal apology
		for the nice-ass remark would be in
		order. I just don't quite know how
		to word it.

				SHEPHERD
		It's my fault. I shouldn't have
		called you at home. Should I call
		you at the office tomorrow?

				SYDNEY
		No, sir, of course not. I mean --
		yes, you can call me anytime you want
		-- this is fine. Right now is fine.
		When I said "of course not," I meat
		that...You know what? The hell with it
		-- I'm moving to another country.

				SHEPHERD
			   (smiling)
		What did you mean when you said you
		don't have a phone.

				SYDNEY
		I just moved to Washington over the
		weekend, and my apartment isn't ready
		yet. This is my sister's apartment.
		Come to think of it, how did you get
		this number?

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		How did I get the number. That's a
		reasonable question. I don't know.
		Probably the FBI.

				SYDNEY
			   (trying to pretend
			    it's just another
			guy on the phone)
		The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want
		to find someone and you're the
		president, that's who you would call.

				SHEPHERD
		You know who else is good at that?

				SYDNEY
		The C.I.A.?

				SHEPHERD
		Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the
		Internal Revenue Service. They have
		computer files that...Well...I should
		stop stalling. As I'm sure you know,
		the French have elected themselves a
		new president, and we're having a formal
		state dinner at the White House, and I
		was wondering -- and you're under no
		obligation at all -- but I thought it
		might be fun... I was wondering if you
		maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh...
		there it is. That's why I was calling.

	There's a long silence on the phone.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Sydney? Sydney, Congress doesn't
		take this long to--

				SYDNEY
		The President has asked me to join
		him in representing our country.
		I'm honored. I'm equal to the task.
		And I won't let you down, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		Sydney, this is just a dinner. We're
		not gonna be doing espionage or
		anything.

				SYDNEY
		No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what
		do I do? I, I mean, where do I go?
		Should I meet you? Will you...

				SHEPHERD
		I'm gonna have a very nice woman
		named Marsha Bridgeport call you.
		She's the White House Social Director,
		and she'll help you with anything you
		want. Now when she calls you and tells
		you her name is Marsha Bridgeport,
		it'll help if you give her the
		benefit of the doubt.

				SYDNEY
		Of course.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll see you Thursday night.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, thank you for asking
		me. Really. This is a first for me.

				SHEPHERD
		Me too.

	They hang up.

	EXT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	INT. THE CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY

	A large conference room at OEOB has been converted for the
	use of a half-dozen STAFFERS as well as ten or twelve
	interns, some of them high school age. A sign on a
	corkboard reads, "17 Votes in 69 Days."

	The two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so
	that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following
	numbers in descending order.

	There is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the
	House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns:
	FOR, LEANING TOWARDS, UNDECIDED, LEANING AGAINST, and AGAINST.

				KODAK
		Who's on Indiana?
			   (raising his voice)
		Excuse me. New people, I can't
		remember your names. Raise your
		hand if you're on Indiana.

	Two INTERNS raise their hands--

				KODAK
			   (continuing)
		Put your hands down -- you're on
		Illinois.

	LEWIS comes in.

				LEWIS
		We've got Jarrett.

				KODAK
		What?

				LEWIS
		George Jarrett. He's ours. Solid
		"yes."

				KODAK
		I don't believe it.
			   (to an INTERN)
		You. New guy. "Jarrett, Democrat,
		Minnesota." Slide his name on over
		to "for."
			   (to Lewis)
		We just had his name laminated under
		"Undecided." How'd you get the fence
		pole out of his butt?

				LEWIS
		I wish I could take credit. He just
		said, "Lewis, I support the President
		a hundred percent ." Not the bill,
		the President.

				LEWIS
		We're gonna win this in a walk. It's
		like a kissing booth at a carnival.
		Give us a vote, get a photo-op with
		number 63.

	LEWIS reaches to the tote board and pulls the "17" off,
	revealing "16."

				LEWIS
		We should have gone after the
		handguns.

				KODAK
		We gotta do one thing at a time.

				LEWIS
		We don't have time to do one thing at
		a time.

	A GDC conference room that SYDNEY, her assistant, DAVID, and
	two INTERNS have made into their 72-day headquarters. A
	similar tote board reads "23 Votes in 69 Days."

	The two interns are marking spreadsheets. DAVID is on one
	phone, SYDNEY is on another.

				DAVID
			   (into phone)
		Carol, it's David in Sydney Wade's
		office. I want to confirm her lunch
		with the Congressman.

				SYDNEY
			   (into phone)
		We could do with a little party
		leadership, Mike. Is the Majority
		Whip takin' a break? Congress is in
		session, right, I'm not wrong about
		that?

	LISA, another intern, is hanging up a phone in the background
	and crossing to the corkboard.

				LISA
		I just got off with Luther Simons.
		Brock's on board.

				SYDNEY
		Terrific!

	She rips the "23" off, making it "22." SYDNEY reaches for
	her coffee and knocks over a cup of pencils. In righting the
	pencils, she knocks over her coffee.

				DAVID
		You're awfully jumpy today. What do
		you have -- a big date tonight?

	With that, a big pile of papers is sent flying off the desk.

	in his late forties.

				REPORTER (LLOYD)
			   (to the camera)
		I'm standing here with Senate

		looking forward to a pleasant evening.

				LUCY
		All done.

	He looks in the mirror.

				SHEPHERD

		Really, where did you learn?

				LUCY
		Yeah.

				SHEPHERD

		Dad, it's cool. Go for it.

				SHEPHERD
		You know, I'm a little nervous.

		Yes, sir. I remember.

	ESTHER, MACINERNERY, A.J.'S wife, joins them.

				A.J.
		You know my wife, Esther.

				SYDNEY
		Sure. It's nice to see you again.

				ESTHER
			   (affectionately)
		Sydney, the President told me about
		how you two met. I think it's
		priceless.

				SYDNEY
		I don't know what happened. One
		minute I was calling him a mockery of
		an environmental leader. The next
		minute I had a date.

				ESTHER
		Men like being insulted by women.
		It makes them feel loved. Don't ask
		me why.

				A.J.
		Sydney, when you meet the French
		President, don't make him feel too
		loved, all right? We just signed a
		new trade agreement.

				SYDNEY
		Got it.

	The French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to D'Astier)
		Mr. President, would allow me to
		introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the
		Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney,
		this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier
		and his wife Monique Danielle
		D'Astier of France.

				SYDNEY
		An honor to meet you both.

				JANIE
		Mr. President, I'm sorry to
		interrupt. The receiving line is in

	INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads
	to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters
	the East Room.

	The GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so
	that the two of them can have some privacy.

				SHEPHERD
		Once we hit the bottom of the
		stairs, I gotta do a thing.
		You'll be escorted...

				SYDNEY
		They took me through it.

	After a slight pause--

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing)
		Do you do this often, sir?

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		This is, actually, only our second
		State Dinner. The first was for the
		Emperor of Japan, who died shortly
		after that, so we stopped having them
		for a while, just in case.

				SYDNEY
		I meant do you go out on...do you--
		often--do you--

				SHEPHERD
		Do I date a lot?

				SYDNEY
		Well, yeah.

				SHEPHERD
		No. How 'bout you?

				SYDNEY
		Me? Lately, I seem to be going out
		on a lot of first dates.

				SHEPHERD
		Then you're experienced at this.

				SYDNEY
		Oh yeah, you can ask me anything.

				SHEPHERD
		How are we doing so far?

				SYDNEY
		It's hard to say at this point. So
		far it's just your typical first date
		stuff.

	And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East
	Room--

	--The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four
	ruffles and flourishes.

				SHEPHERD
		Damn. And I wanted to find a way to
		be different from the other guys.

	A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces--

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Ladies and gentlemen, the President
		of the United States.

	And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision --

				SHEPHERD
		By the way, nice shoes.

	--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion
	Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF.

	The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud.

	The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot
	where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the
	applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite
	swept up.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. EAST ROOM - NIGHT

	The room is beautifully appointed, with the Marine Corps
	Dance Band playing dinner music -- and the SECRET SERVICE
	strategically positioned.

                                                            CUT TO:

	AT SHEPHERD'S TABLE

	STEWARDS are clearing away the main course and refilling wine
	glasses.

	In addition to the two main couples, and ESTHER MacINERNEY
	and TWO OTHER COUPLES are seated at the President's table.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, the President and Mrs.
		D'Astier look bored. They're not
		talking to anybody.

				SHEPHERD
		They're hammered. Esther, do you speak
		French?

				ESTHER
		Latin.

				SHEPHERD
		I thought you spoke French.

				ESTHER
		No, Latin.

				SHEPHERD
		Great, next time Julius Caesar comes
		to town, you're our gal. Sydney, I
		don't suppose that you speak any--

				SYDNEY
		         (taking over--
		          to D'Astier)
		Monsieur le President, nous sommes
		tous habilles, nous avons ce
		merveilleux orchestre, une piece
		magnifique...comment se fait-il que
		les invites ne dansent pas?

				SHEPHERD
			   (proudly to A.J. and
			    Esther)
		That's my date.

				D'ASTIER
		Je ne connais pas la tradition en
		Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les
		invites de Louis XVI et Marie
		Antoinette avaient ose danser devant
		le roi et la reine, ils auraient
		perdu la tete.

				SYDNEY
		Really?

				MADAME D'ASTIER
		Absolument.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, you didn't dissolve the NATO
		treaty, did you?

				SYDNEY
		I just said that we're sitting in this
		beautiful room, listening to the music
		of this wonderful orchestra, and I
		wondered why nobody was dancing.

				D'ASTIER
		And I informed Ms. Wade that in my
		country, a guest at the palace of
		Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would
		soon find their head in a guillotine
		if they made the impertinent gesture
		of dancing without so much as a
		by-your-leave from the King and the Queen.

				A.J.
		I'll bet no one accused Louis of
		being soft on crime.

				SYDNEY
		There's a lesson there, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		More beheadings at the White House?

				A.J.
		Bob Rumson would embrace it.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm sure he would, but I have a
		better idea.

	SHEPHERD stands, holds out his hand to SYDNEY.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Would you like to dance?

				SYDNEY
		Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, yes, sir,
		I'd love to.

	SHEPHERD and SYDNEY move to the dance floor, accompanied by
	the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the GUESTS.

	The dance band begins, and SYDNEY and SHEPHERD dance...

	...beautifully.

	                                                     CUT TO:

	THE GUESTS

	each and every one of them, have stopped all conversation and
	are fixating on this captivating sight. As we go around the
	room, we can observe the subtle reactions of, at first,
	various anonymous GUESTS, then

	                                                     CUT TO:

	A.J. AND ESTHER MACINERNEY,

	holding hands smiling as they watch their old friend, and we

	                                                     CUT TO:

	RUMSON'S TABLE

	where the Minority Leader's game face can barely conceal the
	gears that have slowly begun to turn in his head, as we

	                                                     CUT TO:

	SHEPHERD AND SYDNEY DANCING

				SYDNEY
		I don't know how you do it.

				SHEPHERD
		Arthur Murray. Six lessons.

				SYDNEY
		That's not what I mean. Two hundred
		pairs of eyes are focused on you
		right now, with two questions:
		"Who's this girl, and why's our
		president dancing with her?"

				SHEPHERD
		First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes
		aren't focused on me. They're
		focused on you. And the answers are
		"Sydney Ellen Wade" and "Because she
		said 'yes.'"


	LEWIS AND ROBIN

	looking on from the back of the room.

				LEWIS
		They make a nice couple.

				ROBIN
		Lovely.

				LEWIS
		We've got troubles.

				ROBIN
		Huge.

	As PEOPLE start onto dance floor, we

	INT. A BLACK LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	as it pulls away from the White House and into the night. In
	the back, SYDNEY slips a shoe off and rubs her foot.

	She smiles, then turns around to look out the back window as
	the White House slips out of view.

	INT. OUTER OFFICE OF THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE are at their respective desks as
	SHEPHERD walks in.

				SHEPHERD
		Good morning, Mrs. Chapil.

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Good morning, Mr. President. Mr.
		Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the
		office, sir. They said they needed to
		speak with you before scheduling.

				SHEPHERD
		Fine. Janie, can you get me the
		number of a local florist?

				JANIE
		I'll take care of it, sir. Where do
		you want them sent?

				SHEPHERD
		I want to do it myself. I just need
		the phone number.

				JANIE
		I don't understand.

				SHEPHERD
		I want the phone number of a florist.

				JANIE
		You just want the phone number?

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah.

				JANIE
			   (beat)
		I don't understand, sir, is there--

				SHEPHERD
		I want to send some flowers, Janie.
		I want to do it myself. I don't want
		to staff it out, and I don't want to
		issue an Executive Order. I just
		want a phone number.

				JANIE
		I'll get it for you right away, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Thank you.

	He heads into the office.

	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	where LEWIS and ROBIN are waiting anxiously.

				ROBIN
		Mr. President, we need five minutes
		before scheduling if you can spare it.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to Robin)
		I just need two minutes to make a
		call and I'll be right with you.

	JANIE enters and hands SHEPHERD a piece of paper.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Thank you, Janie.

	She exits.

				LEWIS
		Who are we calling, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm calling the Organization of the
		United Brotherhood of It's-None-of-
		Your-Damn-Business, Lewis. I'll be
		with you in a minute.

				LEWIS
		Yes, sir.

	LEWIS and ROBIN exit the Oval Office. SHEPHERD picks up the
	phone.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to the OPERATOR)
		Yeah, good morning. How do I get an
		outside line? Really? That's simple.
		Thank you.

	SHEPHERD dials the phone number JANIE's given him.

	SHEPHERD'S VOICE comes through on INTERCOM.

				SHEPHERD (O.S.)
			   (through intercom)
		Janie, what's the state flower of

				JANIE

		Mrs. Chapil. State flower of

				MRS. CHAPIL
		The dogwood.

		It's the dogwood.
			   (pause)
		What? Hold on please.
			   (to JANIE, through

		Janie, the dogwood is a tree, not a

				JANIE (O.S.)

		Sir, it's a tree and a flower.

				SHEPHERD

		Really? No dogwoods? How 'bout
		roses? Simple. Classic. Two dozen

		Janie, I'm the President senior

	INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY

	SYDNEY enters.

				SYDNEY
		Leo, you wanted to see me?

				LEO
		So there I was, thinking maybe I
		should give Sydney a call. She's
		new in town, doesn't know many
		people...

	LEO produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo
	of SHEPHERD and SYDNEY dancing.

				SYDNEY
		Leo--

				LEO
		Then I picked up the Times--

				SYDNEY
		It was crazy. He called me at home.

				LEO
		What's going on?

				SYDNEY
		Nothing. It was innocent. His
		cousin got the flu at the last
		minute.

				LEO
		Did you sleep with him?

				SYDNEY
		What?

				LEO
		Did you sleep--

				SYDNEY
		That's none of your business, Leo.

				LEO
		Yeah, it is, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		You wanna tell me how my personal
		life in any way--

				LEO
		Because when it's the President, it's
		not personal. Sydney, I hired your
		reputation. I hired a pit bull, not
		a prom queen.

				SYDNEY
		That's unfair.

				LEO
		It's incredibly unfair. But you've
		spent a lot of time over the year
		telling me the trouble with the
		environmental lobby is that we don't
		understand the fundamental truth that
		politics is perception. This is a
		bad time to develop ignorance.

				SYDNEY
		You're making way too much of this.

				LEO
		Am I? This is your time, Sydney.
		You're sitting at the grown-ups'
		table. You have a chance to get
		everything you want -- run a national
		campaign, be a major player inside
		the party. But this relationship had
		better go all the way, because with
		the leader of the free world there is
		no halfway. Politics is perception,
		and if thing don't work out, the
		amount of time it'll take you to go
		from being a hired gun to a cocktail
		party joke can be clocked with an egg
		timer.

	There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in
	with a strange-looking package.

				SYDNEY
		Leo, there is no relationship. It
		was one night. It's done.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered
		by White House messenger. It's
		marked "Perishable."

				LEO
		The White House has sent me something
		perishable?

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		It's for Ms. Wade.

				LEO
		Here we go...

	SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package.

				SYDNEY
		Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a
		formality.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
			   (exited)
		It's from him.

				LEO
		Of course it's from him.

				SYDNEY
		So he had some staff flunky send
		me a fruit basket.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		He wrote the note himself.

				SYDNEY
		I'm sure he didn't take the time to--

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		The messenger said he was waiting in
		the Oval Office for ten minutes while
		the President wrote the card.

				SYDNEY
		Okay, listen, so he--
			   (to LEO'S SECRETARY)
		--it took him ten minutes to write a
		card?!

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		Apparently he went through several
		drafts.

	SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is.

				LEO
		What is it...what is it?

				SYDNEY
		A ham.

				LEO
			   (beat)
		A ham?

				SYDNEY
		He sent me a Virginia ham.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the
		President's girlfriend.

	SYDNEY's smile fades away...she looks at LEO.

				LEO
		There's never an egg timer around
		when you need one.

	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	SHEPHERD is conferring with LEWIS and ROBIN.

				ROBIN
		Sir, they're gonna be pressing today
		about whether the White House is
		prepared to soften the assault
		weapons section of the crime bill.

				LEWIS
		There is no need to entertain that
		at this point.

				ROBIN
		How do you want me to handle the
		Sydney issue?

				SHEPHERD
		The Sydney issue?

				LEWIS
		We should have a consensus on how the
		White House is going to handle it.

				SHEPHERD
		I sure hope the Sydney issue refers
		in some way to a problem we're having
		with Australia, because if it's
		anything else...

	JANIE pokes her head in.

				JANIE
		Mr. President, Ms. Wade is here to
		see you.

				SHEPHERD
		Tell her she can come right in. I'm
		finished here.

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			 (to LEWIS and ROBIN)
		There is no Sydney issue.

	SYDNEY enters, crossing paths with LEWIS and ROBIN. They
	exchange pleasantries.

				SYDNEY
			   (to SHEPHERD)
		Thanks for seeing me on such short
		notice.

				SHEPHERD
		No problem. Did you get the ham?

				SYDNEY
		I got the ham, yes. Thank you very
		much.

				SHEPHERD
		I wanted to send you flowers, but
		there seem to be some kinks in the
		system. I'm really glad you stopped
		by. I had such a good time last
		night.

				SYDNEY
		So did I. It's just that...

	JANIE enters.

				JANIE
		They're 45 seconds away, sir.

	During the following, JANIE will go to the desk, pick up two
	briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up
	his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm delivering a luncheon speech at
		the Governor's Conference this
		morning. I'm sorry to--

				SYDNEY
		No, no, that's fine. I just stopped
		by to...

				SHEPHERD
		Are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

				SYDNEY
		Dinner?

				SHEPHERD
		Casual. In the Residence. Without
		the United Nations. My daughter'll
		be with us, so it may seem like the
		United--

				SYDNEY
		I'd love to meet Lucy, but...

	An AIDE has slipped in and hands SHEPHERD a note.

				SHEPHERD
			   (reading to himself
			   as he talks SYDNEY)
		She's gonna like you.
			   (calling to the AIDE)
		Excuse me -- Jeff!

				SYDNEY
		Actually, I have some concerns that--

	The AIDE (JEFF) steps back in--

				JEFF
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			   (reading the note)
		I can't do this.

				JEFF
		Which? Robbins or Stackhouse?

				SHEPHERD
		Either one. I have to be in and out.

				JEFF
		Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just
		needed 10 minutes. I think he wants
		to talk about the assault weapons.

				SHEPHERD
		Stackhouse wants to talk about
		grazing rights. Trust me.

				JEFF
		Got it.

	And he's gone.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to Sydney)
		Sorry. You have concerns.

				SYDNEY
		Yes. Not many. A few. One. I have
		one concern.

				SHEPHERD
		Does it having anything to do with
		one of us being the President?

				SYDNEY
		You like to make jokes about this,
		but--

				SHEPHERD
		I am not mocking you, honest. I'm
		just a guy asking a girl over for a
		meal.

	And, as if from out of nowhere, a LOUD CLAAAMMERING, like the
	sound of a jackhammer against cement, comes from somewhere
	outside -- growing louder and closer --

				SYDNEY
		What's that?

				SHEPHERD
		My ride's here.

	And, sure enough, coming into view outside the windows of the
	Oval Office, is MARINE-1, the President's helicopter. JANIE
	comes back in and helps him on with his coat and scarf.

				SYDNEY
		Leo Solomon has serious concerns
		about my exploring a social, you
		know, scenario, with the President
		of the United States.

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah, well, when you put it that
		way, it doesn't sound that great
		to me either.

				SYDNEY
		It's just not--

				SHEPHERD
		Have dinner with Lucy and me. It's
		meat loaf night -- how presidential
		can it be?

	As SHEPHERD rushes out...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Seven-thirty.

	SYDNEY now stands alone in the OVAL OFFICE, trying to figure
	out what just happened.

		Nice to meet you.

		My dad told me to tell you he's on

		I should behave myself and entertain
		you till he gets here.

				SYDNEY
		Your father's on the phone with his
		dentist?

				LUCY
		No. He told me to tell you he's on
		the phone with his dentist. He wants
		you to think he's a regular guy.

				SYDNEY
		Who is he on the phone with?

				LUCY
		The Prime Minister of Israel.

				SYDNEY
		They're probably not discussing his

				LUCY
		No. They're talking about that

		Yeah.

		Everything all right with your teeth?

		My teeth?

		Oh, right. I've got a cavity in my

	The look and feel of old money. Rumson is holding court with

				RUMSON
			   (continuing)
		Voters aren't interested in how to
		achieve economic growth, and they
		don't want to hear our plans to
		strengthen foreign policy.

				STAFFER #1
		So it comes down to character.

				STAFFER #2
		The press like him, Senator. The
		networks, the newspapers, they're--

				RUMSON
		Reporters like him. Networks and
		newspapers like ratings and circulation.
		For all the bitching we do about liberal
		bias in the press when it comes down to
		a character debate...

				STAFFER #3
		The press is an unwitting accomplice.

				CARL
		Bob, the character debate didn't work
		out for us.

				RUMSON
		Because it couldn't. Our polling
		told us that attacking his character
		less than a year after he'd lost his
		wife was gonna be a turn-off and was
		gonna make people feel sorry for him.
		We couldn't run the campaign we wanted
		because the opponent was a widower.

				CARL
		He's still a widower. Time's passed,
		but--

				RUMSON
			   (to the rest)
		You'll have to forgive my friend.
		He's been on a hunting trip and cut
		off from the world.

				CARL
		What's going on?

	And four STAFFERS grab whatever newspaper is closest to their
	hand and toss them to CARL.

				RUMSON
		The President's got a girlfriend.

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

	LUCY, SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are finishing up a game of Scrabble.

				SYDNEY
			   (to LUCY)
		Your dad says you're studying the
		Constitutional Convention.

				SHEPHERD
		She's not having any fun, though.

				LUCY
		Dad--

				SYDNEY
		You're not having fun?

				LUCY
			   (to herself)
		This is a nightmare. This is a
		social studies nightmare.

				SHEPHERD
		They're doing a mock Congress. Each
		kid is playing one of the original
		delegates, and they debate the
		Amendments. Now what's not fun about
		that?

	LUCY gets up from the table and kisses her father.

				LUCY
		G'night, Dad.

				SHEPHERD
		G'night, sweetheart.

				LUCY
		It was nice meeting you, Mrs.--

				SYDNEY
		Sydney.

				LUCY
		It was nice meeting you, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		Thank you. It was nice meeting
		you.

				SHEPHERD
		Sleep well, honey. I love you.

				LUCY
		I love you, too.

	LUCY leaves. SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are alone now.

				SYDNEY
		She's wonderful.

				SHEPHERD
		She's her mother.

				SYDNEY
		She's you.

	After a pause...

				SHEPHERD
		Would you like the 25-cent tour?

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. THE EAST WING - NIGHT

	This is the "museum" area of the White House, the part you
	see when you take the official tour. Only a few lights are
	lit, and while the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS give SHEPHERD plenty
	of breathing room when he's in the residence, we'll still
	catch a glimpse of one of them rounding a corner in the
	distance or checking a doorway ahead.

				SYDNEY
		I thought C-STAD wasn't gonna be
		operational until January.

				SHEPHERD
		It was ready ahead of schedule.
		We've just been waiting for the
		personnel.

				SYDNEY
		The Israelis?

				SHEPHERD
		No, our guys. We've sent a team of
		Army instructors to train the
		Israelis.

	SYDNEY and SHEPHERD enter the:


	INT. THE CHINA ROOM - NIGHT

	Named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full
	place settings of the official White House china and
	silverware from every administration since Jackson.

				SHEPHERD:
			   (remembering)
		I think this is the dish room.

				SYDNEY
		It's not the dish--

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah, it is. It's the room with all
		the dishes.

				SYDNEY
		It's the China Room.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm more of a West Wing President.
		If you're curious about the mansion,
		there's probably a book you can get--

				SYDNEY
		There're about seven-thousand books.
		I'll get one for you.

	SYDNEY's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the
	display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows,
	she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of
	incredibly flattering moonlight.

	The vision isn't lost on SHEPHERD. They stare at each other
	for a moment.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President -- have you ever noticed
		how similar the Van Buren flatware is
		to the Buchanan flatware?

				SHEPHERD
		Do you think there will ever come a
		time when you can stand in a room
		with me and not think of me as the
		President?

				SYDNEY
		This isn't a state of mind. You are
		the President. And when I'm in a
		room with you, oval or any other
		shape, I'm always gonna be a
		lobbyist, and you'll always be the
		President.

				SHEPHERD
		I got news for you, Sydney. As a
		lobbyist, you would never be alone in
		a room with the President.

	This last statement is not lost on SYDNEY.

	He moves toward her until they are both bathed in the
	moonlight. He puts his arms around her.

				SYDNEY
		You think this is a good idea?

				SHEPHERD
		Probably not.

	They lean in to kiss each other. They barely make contact
	when...

				AGENT #3 (O.S.)
		Mr. President...

	An AGENT is standing in the doorway -- SHEPHERD and SYDNEY
	break apart.

				AGENT #3
		We have a secure call from the sit-
		room.

	SHEPHERD knows what that means.

				SHEPHERD
		Excuse me.

	He moves out the door and into the corridor.

	SYDNEY, knowing something's wrong, instinctively moves to
	follow him and be with him, but the AGENT hasn't moved from
	the doorway, so--

				AGENT #3
		Sorry, ma'am.

				SYDNEY
			   (beat)
		No...of course.

	SHEPHERD comes back in.

				SHEPHERD
		Listen--

				SYDNEY
		Is anything wrong?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm sorry, we're going to have to cut
		our evening short. The Libyans have
		just bombed C-STAD. I'll try to call
		you tomorrow.
			   (to the AGENT)
		Can you show Ms. Wade out.

	SHEPHERD exits.

	SYDNEY, alone for a second in the dish room, is finally
	approached by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT, who starts to escort
	her out.

				CHAIRMAN (V.O.)
		The response scenario's in place...

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD, A.J., the SECRETARY OF STATE, the SECRETARY OF
	DEFENSE, and about a dozen or so Pentagon, Security Council,
	and Joint Chiefs OFFICIALS are doing exactly what they're
	trained for.

				CHAIRMAN
			   (continuing)
		...The F-18's are fired up on the
		Kimitz and the Kitty Hawk. They're
		just waiting for your attack order,
		Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		And we're gonna hit Libyan
		Intelligence Headquarters?

				MAN
		The N.S.A. confirmed they're the ones
		who planned the bombing.


				A.J.
		What's the estimate?

				GENERAL
		We'll level the building.

				SHEPHERD
		Libyan I.H.Q's in the middle of
		downtown Tripoli -- are we gonna hit
		anything else?

				GENERAL
		Only if we miss.

				SHEPHERD
		Are we gonna miss?

				GENERAL
		No, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		How many people work in that building?

				CHAIRMAN
		We've been all through--

				SHEPHERD
		How many people work in the damn
		building?

				DEPUTY
		I've got those number here. There
		are three shifts, so it--

				SHEPHERD
		The fewest. What shift puts the
		fewest people in the building? The
		night shift, right?

				DEPUTY
		By far. Mostly custodial staff and
		a few--

				SHEPHERD
		What time does the night crew go on?

				DEPUTY
		They're on now, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		A.J.?

				A.J.
		It's immediate, it's decisive, it's
		low risk, and it's a proportional
		response.

				SHEPHERD
		Someday somebody's going to have to
		explain to me the virtue of a
		proportional response.

	There's a SILENCE. SHEPHERD gets up and starts to head out
	the door.

				CHAIRMAN
		Mr. President?

				SHEPHERD
		Attack.
	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD is with A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, KODAK and a couple of
	AIDES, all of whom look as though they've been called out of
	their homes in the middle of the night.

				A.J.
		Robin, as soon as our planes have
		cleared Libyan airspace, you can call
		the press. I don't know when we'll
		have the full B.D.A.--

				LEWIS
		General Rork says around O-Eight
		Hundred.

				ROBIN
		Sir, what do you think about a
		national address?

				SHEPHERD
		The last thing I want to do is put
		the Lybians center stage.

				KODAK
		I think it's a great idea, sir. You
		know Rumson's gonna be talking about
		your lack of military service.

				SHEPHERD
		This isn't about Rumson. What I did
		tonight was not about political gain.

				KODAK
		But it can be, sir. What you did
		tonight was very presidential.

				SHEPHERD
		Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now
		there's a janitor working the night
		shift at the Libyan Intelligence
		Headquarters. He's going about his
		job 'cause he has no idea that in
		about an hour he's gonna die in a
		massive explosion. He's just going
		about his job 'cause he has no idea
		that an hour ago I gave an order to
		have him killed. You just saw me do
		the least presidential thing I do.

				KODAK
		yes, sir.

				PRESS (V.O.)
		Mr. President...Mr. President!

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

	SHEPHERD is at the podium taking questions. He's flanked by
	his PENTAGON STAFF. A.J. and LEWIS stand to the side. ROBIN
	stands out of the way.

				SALLY
		Is there anything at all about the
		C-STAD weapons system that could have
		been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence
		as offensive rather than defensive?

				SHEPHERD
		No. We did everything but show them
		the blueprints. The hardware was
		sitting in a airplane hangar for a
		month. They didn't hit it until the

	American personnel got there. Leslie.

				LESLIE
		Sir, there's an unconfirmed report
		that you were with Sydney Wade when
		you learned of the attack. Can you
		comment?

				A.J.
			   (sotto to ROBIN)
		Get him off.

				SHEPHERD
		Yes, we'd just finished dinner.

				ROBIN
		Last question.

				MARK
		Sir, would you care to comment on
		the status of your relationship?

				SHEPHERD
		We don't have a relationship. We
		just had dinner.

				CAROL
		Can you tell us if she spent the
		night at the White House or did--

				SHEPHERD
		Folks, a lot of people got killed
		last night. Let's try to keep our
		eyes on the ball, okay?

	SHEPHERD is herded out of the briefing room amidst a chorus
	of "Mr. President" 's.

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. THE WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

	SHEPHERD walks away from the briefing room with ROBIN. JANIE
	joins him.

				ROBIN
		That was my fault, sir. We should
		have prepped you for that.

				SHEPHERD
		There's nothing that needs prepping.
		A.J., let's meet with the leadership
		after we meet with the Security
		Council.

				ROBIN
		"Newsweek" is begging for ten minutes
		today. Any ten minutes you got.

				SHEPHERD
		Nobody gets ten minutes today.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD sits at his desk, is on the phone. A TELEVISION
	NEWSCAST is doing a report on Congressional reaction to the
	events of the day. ROB RUMSON is talking.

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis, tell the speaker to wait.
		I want to talk to him. No, I'll be
		right down.

				RUMSON
		...Last night, the price of his
		liberal programs was raised to
		include the blood of 22 American
		soldiers.

	He hangs up. On the TV, we see a quick sound bite from RUMSON.

				RUMSON
		...Mr. Shepherd's read a lot of
		books, but you didn't need a Harvard
		degree to see this comin' a mile down
		the road.

				SHEPHERD
		I went to Stanford, you blowhole.

				RUMSON
		The fat that our Commander-in-Chief
		has not served one day in uniform--

	SHEPHERD clicks off the TV and then stares at

	A SLIP OF PAPER THAT SAYS "SYDNEY"

	EXT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				BETH (V.O.)
		This box just says "Miscellaneous."
		Is this bedroom miscellaneous or
		kitchen miscellaneous?

	INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	SYDNEY and BETH have been getting SYDNEY moved in. BETH is
	holding a carton.

				BETH
		Sydney?

				SYDNEY
		Why did I have to kiss him?

				BETH
		You kissed him?

				SYDNEY
		Yeah.

				BETH
		You didn't' tell me that.

				SYDNEY
		I kissed him.

				BETH
		Where?

				SYDNEY
		On the mouth.

				BETH
			   (exasperated)
		Where in the White House?!

				SYDNEY
		In the dish room.

				BETH
		The dish room?

				SYDNEY
		The China Room.

				BETH
		Then what happened?

				SYDNEY
		He had to go and attack Libya.

				BETH
		It's always something.

				SYDNEY
		I've gotta nip this in the bud. This
		has catastrophe written all over it.

				BETH
		In what language?! Sydney, this man
		is the leader of the free world.
		He's brilliant, he's funny, he's
		handsome, and he's an above-average
		dancer. Isn't it possible our
		standards are just a tad high?

	The PHONE RINGS--

	SYDNEY freezes.

	The PHONE RINGS again.

				BETH
			   (continuing)
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY
		It's him.

				BETH
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY
		He's gonna ask me to come over
		there.

				BETH
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY
		I don't want to go over there.

				BETH
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY

	All right. But I'm gonna end it
		on the phone. I'm not gonna go
		over there.

	INT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD opens his door, revealing SYDNEY. Agent COOPER is
	letting her in.

				SYDNEY
		I just came over here to tell you
		why I can't see you anymore.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to COOPER)
		Thanks, Coop.

	SHEPHERD closes the door.

				SYDNEY
		Look, I know you've had a tough
		day.

				SHEPHERD
		Not as tough as some. You want a
		drink? Lemme take your coat.

	But SYDNEY doesn't take her coat off.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, this isn't gonna work.

				SHEPHERD
		Sure it will. You button the top
		button, and it doesn't fall off
		the hanger.


				SYDNEY
		That's not what I...

				SHEPHERD
		I didn't think so. Listen...

				SYDNEY
		I've really enjoyed the time we've
		spent together, but this has
		catastrophe written all over it.
		Please, Mr. President, don't pursue
		me outside the political arena.

				SHEPHERD
		Well, I have no intention of pursuing
		you inside the political arena, so
		that leaves everything out, and
		that's unacceptable to me.

				SYDNEY
		If I were on your staff, I would tell
		you that the absolute worst thing you
		can do coming into an election year
		is to open yourself up to character
		attacks, and the fastest way to do
		that is to prance around like the
		playboy of the Western world.

				SHEPHERD
		Let's clear up a couple of things.
		Number 1: I seldom prance.
		Number 2: I have no intention of
		engaging in a character debate, and
		Number 3: You're not on my staff.

				SYDNEY
		Yes, of course, but if you'll follow
		the immutable--

				SHEPHERD
		Why is that, by the way?

				SYDNEY
		Why's that?

				SHEPHERD
		Why aren't you on my staff?

				SYDNEY
		You can't afford me.

				SHEPHERD
		How much do you make?

				SYDNEY
		More than you do, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		The name's Andy. How much money do
		you make?

				SYDNEY
		What the hell does it matter how
		much money I--

				SHEPHERD
		You would raise your voice to the
		President?

				SYDNEY
		I'm only thinking about the health
		of your Presidency. You think this
		morning's press conference was the
		end of it? Bob Rumson's gotta be
		drooling over this.

				SHEPHERD
		Are you attracted to me?

				SYDNEY
		I beg your pardon?

				SHEPHERD
		I asked if--

				SYDNEY
			    (of course she is)
		That's not the issue--

				SHEPHERD
		Well, I tell you what. Let's make
		it the issue. Let's try something
		new, 'cause I know that most couples,
		when they're first getting together,
		are inclined to slam on the brakes
		because they're concerned about Bob
		Rumson's drool.

				SYDNEY
		You're not most people.

				SHEPHERD
		You know what your problem is?

				SYDNEY
		What's my problem?

				SHEPHERD
		Sex and nervousness.

				SYDNEY
		Sex and nervousness is my problem.

				SHEPHERD
		Yes. Last night when we were
		looking at the different place
		settings in the dish room, I
		realized that those place settings
		were provided by the First Ladies.
		And I'll bet none of those First
		Ladies were nervous about having
		sex with their President husbands.
		And you know why?

				SYDNEY
		No, but I'm sure you'll explain it
		to me.

				SHEPHERD
		I will. Because they weren't
		presidents when they met them. Not
		the case here.

				SYDNEY
		Ahhhhhh.

				SHEPHERD
		You see what I'm getting at?

				SYDNEY
		Yes. May I use your bathroom for a
		moment?

				SHEPHERD
		Sure. It's right through there.

				SYDNEY
		I want to freshen up.

				SHEPHERD
		As you pass through, you'll see a
		large closet on your left. And if
		you feel comfortable, hang up your
		coat, and when you come back I'll
		have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on
		the couch, and I will explain to
		you my plan.

				SYDNEY
		You have a plan? Don't make me
		wait. You're on a roll.

	SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area.
	SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a
	couple of drinks.

				SHEPHERD
			   (speaking up)
		Okay. You're attracted to me, but
		the idea of physical intimacy is
		uncomfortable because you only know
		me as the President. It's not always
		gonna be that way, and the reason I
		know that is because there was a
		moment last night when you were with
		me and not the President, and I know
		what a big step that was for you.
		So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's
		my plan: We're gonna slow down.
		When you're comfortable, that's
		when it'll happen.

	SYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of
	SHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward
	him.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Perhaps I didn't properly explain
		the fundamentals of the "Slow Down"
		plan.

				SYDNEY
		You explained it great.

	She moves closer to him.

				SHEPHERD
			   (pause)
		Are you nervous?

				SYDNEY
		No.

				SHEPHERD
		Good. My nervousness exists on
		several levels. Number 1 -- and
		this is in no particular order --
		I haven't done this in a pretty
		long time. Number 2: Any expectations
		you might have, due to the fact that
		I'm, you know...

				SYDNEY
		The most powerful man in the world?

				SHEPHERD
		Exactly, thank you. Just so you
		remember that's a political
		distinction that comes with the
		office. I mean, if Eisenhower were
		here instead of me he'd be dead by
		now. And number three...

				SYDNEY
			   (gently)
		Andy...

	They're both standing, facing each other...

	They gently kiss. They just stay with it until it becomes
	easier and better and exactly what they want.

				RUMSON (V.O.)
		Does New Hampshire want traditional
		American values back in the White
		House?

				CROWD
		Yes!!

	INT. AN ELKS LODGE - NIGHT

	A crowd of 300 or so is being whipped into a frenzy.
	Rumson's bringing it home under a campaign banner
	proclaiming: THE PRIDE IS BACK -- BOB RUMSON.

				RUMSON
		Does New Hampshire want the pride back?

	The CROWD goes nuts upon hearing Rumson's signature phrase--

				CROWD
		Yeah!!!!!!!

				RUMSON
		My name is Bob Rumson. And I'm
		running for President.

	And as the CROWD loses its mind, we

	INT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	It is very early, and SHEPHERD is still asleep. As we PULL
	BACK, WE REVEAL that he is alone in his bed. The PHONE RINGS.

	SHEPHERD picks it up--

				SHEPHERD
			   (into phone)
		Yeah...put him through.
			   (listens)
		Lewis, it is 5:00 a.m. You gotta
		get yourself a life, man.
			   (listens)
		Yeah...all right.

	He hangs up the phone and looks around the room, only to
	notice SYDNEY is tiptoeing around in the dim light, trying
	to quietly dress herself and gather up her things. SHEPHERD
	watches this odd spectacle for a moment before he says--

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Sydney?

	SYDNEY turns around.

				SYDNEY
		Hi.

				SHEPHERD
		What are you doing?

				SYDNEY
		I wanted to leave the building before
		the press corps got here.

				SHEPHERD
		I have those same thoughts every day
		of my life. Say, you know Lewis
		Rothschild, don't you? Well, he's...

				SYDNEY
		Sure. Boy, Lewis'd go nuts if he
		knew I'd spent the night.

	There's a KNOCK on the door.

				SHEPHERD
		...on his way up.

				SYDNEY
		What?

				SHEPHERD
		Come on in, Lewis.

	LEWIS comes in--

				LEWIS
		'Morning, Mr. President. Hi, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President,
		thank you for taking the time to go
		over those fossil fuel numbers. I'll
		just get my coat, and be on my way.

	SHEPHERD laughs at SYDNEY's purposely lame try--

				SHEPHERD
			   (to LEWIS)
		What's the situation?

				LEWIS
		They're camped out at every exit.

				SYDNEY
		Who? Who's camped out?

				LEWIS
		The press.

				SYDNEY
		The press is camped out?

				LEWIS
		You shoulda taken a cab, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		They know my car?!

	ROBIN enters.

				ROBIN
		Good morning, Mr. President. Hi,
		Sydney. I came over as soon as Lewis
		called.

				SHEPHERD
		Thank God.

				ROBIN
		I think the important thing is not
		to make it look like we're panicking.

				SHEPHERD
		See, and I think the important thing
		is actually not to be panicking.

	A.J. KNOCKS on the open door and walks in.

				A.J.
		Good morning, Mr. President. Good
		morning, Ms. Wade. I see everyone's
		getting an early start today.

				LEWIS
		How do we exit Sydney from the
		building and what do we say to the
		press at that point?

				ROBIN
		We need a diversion.

				SYDNEY
		A diversion.

				ROBIN
		You understand that by diversion
		I'm not saying we set the White
		House on fire.

				SHEPHERD
		No, please, let's do.

				LEWIS
		Can I state very clearly that I
		can't be party to anything illegal.

				A.J.
		Good for you, Lewis.

				LEWIS
		Say what you want, but it's always
		the guy in my job that ends up doing
		eighteen months in Danbury Minimum
		Security Prison.

				SHEPHERD
		Rest easy, Lewis. We're not creating
		a diversion.

				ROBIN
		No diversion.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to SYDNEY)
		We'll have somebody take you home.

				A.J.
		Esther's over in my office. She's
		got the station wagon outside.

	SHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man planned
	ahead.

				LEWIS
		Okay. Good. Now, the press
		statement.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to SYDNEY)
		Sydney, when you leave here, you're
		gonna run into reporters and
		photographers. Your picture's gonna
		be taken every day, and you're gonna
		be asked questions every day. Answer
		them, don't answer them -- it's
		entirely up to you. The White House
		has no official position except to

		...for his routine physical exam.
		Doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital
		pronounced President Shepherd in
		excellent health.

				SHEPHERD
		Who cares? Let's see some scores.

				NEWS ANCHOR #2
			   (on T.V.)
		While the President spent the day at
		Camp David, G.O.P. presidential
		hopeful Robert Rumson continued his
		attacks on President Shepherd's
		character. During the Saturday
		morning news program Capitol
		Review with Kenneth Michaels,
		Senator Rumson suggested that GDC
		political director Sydney Ellen Wade,
		whose personal relationship with the
		President has been causing the White
		House headaches over the past two
		months, may have traded sexual favors
		for key votes in the Virginia State
		Legislature while lobbying for the
		Virginia Teachers Association.

	The NEWS PROGRAM goes to the segment showing RUMSON and
	MICHAELS on that morning's show. SHEPHERD and SYDNEY sit and
	watch...knowing they're about to take a punch...powerless to
	stop it...

				MICHAELS
			   (on T.V.)
			Wait a minute, Senator--

				RUMSON
			   (on T.V.)
		I'm not saying--

				MICHAELS
			   (on T.V.)
		--'cause that's a heck of an
		accusation to make, and--

				RUMSON
			   (on T.V.)
		I'm not making an acc-- let me be
		very clear. I'm not making an accusation.
		I am saying when we hear one thing,
		we dismiss it. We hear two, we dismiss it.
		But when several, several well-
		respected members and former members of
		the Virginia State House--

				MICHAELS
			   (on T.V.)
		Can you give us names?

				RUMSON
			   (on T.V.)
		--each of their own accord, comes to
		me and expresses concern over the
		woman standing next to -- I don't even
		know, do we call her the First Mistress?
		When several--

				SYDNEY
		My God. He's making this up as he
		goes along.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm so sorry about this, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		Oh, man. My father heard that.

	SHEPHERD clicks off the T.V.

				SHEPHERD
		You gotta tell him to turn a deaf ear.

				SYDNEY
		My father doesn't have a deaf ear.
		He hears fine out of both. So do I.
		So does my sister, so do my friends.
		You're the only one who seems to--

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, I can't challenge the school
		bully to a fight just because he
		picked on my girlfriend.

				SYDNEY
		I'm not asking you to. I can take
		care of myself. This isn't about me.
		How can you keep quiet? How do you
		have patience for people who claim
		they love America but clearly can't
		stand Americans?

				SHEPHERD
		I have one more election left, Sydney.
		I don't have the luxury of losing my
		patience.

				SYDNEY
		I want to say something, but I'm
		gonna fumble it a little bit, so I'd
		just like you to wait till I'm done
		before you respond. I'm in love with
		you. I'm certain of it. And I want to
		be with you more than anything. But
		maybe things would be better for you
		if I disappeared for a while.

				SHEPHERD
		Things will be better when I pass a
		crime bill. And Sydney, if you
		disappeared, I'd find you.

		Mr. President, militant women are out

				SHEPHERD
		Is that a fact?

				GREEN BLAZERED MAN (GILL)
		Have you been following this
		situation down in Atlanta? These

				SHEPHERD
		If I'm not mistaken, Gill, I think

		Yes sir, but now I'm saying these

		Well, it's a world gone mad, Gill.

	LEWIS, KODAK and ROBIN stand huddled with cups of eggnog...

				KODAK
		The country has mood swings.

		Mood swings? Nineteen post-graduate

				KODAK
		Well, I could explain it better, but

		Fellas, we haven't slept in three

	A.J. spots SYDNEY as she walks through the doorway and comes

				A.J.
		Hey, Sydney, Merry Christmas.

				SYDNEY
		Merry Christmas, A.J.

				A.J.
		Where you been?

				SYDNEY
		I got stuck on DePont Circle. I can
		never remember which lane I'm
		supposed to take. Then I got cut off
		by this idiot cab driver who starts
		screaming at me like it's my fault.

				A.J.
		Syd, relax. It's Christmas.

	SHEPHERD joins them.

				SHEPHERD
		Hi, Syd. Get stuck on DuPont Circle
		again?

				SYDNEY
		It's not funny. I hate that place.
		Can't you declare it a Federal
		Disaster Area or something?

				SHEPHERD
		I'll look into it.

				A.J.
		What were you doing up on the Hill,
		anyway?

				SYDNEY
		Ahhh...I had a terrible meeting
		today. Totally lost my cool with
		McSorley, McCluskey and Shane.

				SHEPHERD
		You went to see the Motown Three?

				SYDNEY
		I pitched 'em the hill.

				A.J.
			   (beat)
		On its merits?

				SHEPHERD
		The woman knows no fear. She'd lobby
		the Carolinas to the American Lung
		Association.

				SYDNEY
		It was a disaster.

				A.J.
		You're in good company. I sat with
		'em a week ago. They told me there
		was nothing on the President's
		domestic agenda they were more
		committed to defeating than the crime
		bill.

				SYDNEY
		Well, congratulations, fellas, you're
		outta the cellar. McSorley told me
		the only thing on the President's
		domestic agenda they were more
		committed to defeating than the crime
		bill was the fossil fuel package.

	This catches SHEPHERD and A.J. by surprise--like accidentally
	drawing to an inside straight.

				A.J.
		You're kidding, right?


	SYDNEY isn't aware she's said anything of particular
	consequence.

				SYDNEY
		No, I'm not kidding. It's funny that
		he used the same words.

	A.J. and SHEPHERD are trying to study the situation without
	giving anything away.

				A.J.
		Yeah...

				SHEPHERD
		I don't think the Pep Boys know too
		many words.

				SYDNEY
		I'm gonna get a drink and shake this
		off. When I come back, I'll have
		Christmas spirit.

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		Okay.

				SYDNEY
		Is something wrong?

				SHEPHERD
		No, I was...I was thinking about--
		nothing.

				SYDNEY
		I'll be back in a minute.

	She goes off.

				A.J.
		Did what I think just happened, just
		happen? Did the GDC's political
		director just tell the President and
		the White House Chief of Staff that
		there are three votes on the crime
		bill that can be bought by stickin'
		the fossil fuel package in a drawer.

				SHEPHERD
		No, the GDC's political director
		didn't tell us anything. Sydney Wade
		told her boyfriend and her
		boyfriend's best friend that she had
		a lousy day.

				A.J.
		It doesn't change the facts, Mr.
		President. If Sydney gets her 24
		votes and we're three short, there's
		some maneuvering to be done.

				SHEPHERD
		I made a promise, A.J.

				A.J.
		You made a deal, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		I made it with Sydney.

				A.J.
		You made it with the GDC.

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah, well, this is all academic
		anyway. We're not going to need
		those votes.

				A.J.
		If your approval rating drops any
		more, things are gonna get tight.

		Mr. President, as of this morning,

		Storch.

		I beg your pardon?

				SHEPHERD
		What about Storch?

				KODAK
		Storch is a "no."

		Not that Clark, the one from

		Mr. President, I think we have to

				SHEPHERD
		She is one vote away, A.J. It's
		important legislation that for the

		 I think she deserves every possible
		opportunity to--

				LEWIS
		She? You meant "it," didn't you,
		sir? You meant the "important
		legislation" deserves every
		opportunity.

				A.J.
		Lewis, shut up.

	There's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has locked
	eyes with LEWIS.

				SHEPHERD
		You got something to say to me?

				LEWIS
		Respectfully, sir. I think we should
		examine the new poll for more than
		its value as a box score.

				SHEPHERD
		Examine what? They don't like that
		I'm going out with Sydney.

				LEWIS
		It's not that simple, sir. I think
		this poll helps bribg a murky problem
		into specific relief.

				SHEPHERD
		Whose problem we talking about,
		Lewis? Yours? You worried about
		your job? This poll isn't talking
		about my Presidency. This poll is
		talking about my life. Two hundred
		and sixty-four million people have
		decided--

				LEWIS
		Mr. President, two hundred and sixty-
		four million people don't give a damn
		about your life. They give a damn about
		their own.

				A.J.
		All right, that's enough.

				LEWIS
		Mr. President, you've raised a
		daughter almost entirely on your own,
		and she's terrific. What does it say
		to you that in the last seven weeks,
		59 percent of this country has begun
		to question your family values?

				A.J.
		The President doesn't answer to you,
		Lewis.

				LEWIS
		Oh yes, he does, A.J.  I'm a citizen,
		this is my president, and in this
		country it is not only permissible to
		question our leaders, it is our
		responsibility. But you already know
		that, Mr. President, because you have
		a deeper love of this country than
		any man I've ever known, and I want
		to know what it says to you that in
		the past seven weeks 59 percent of
		Americans have begun to question your
		patriotism?

				SHEPHERD
		Look, if people want to listen to Bob
		Rumson--

				LEWIS
		They don't have a choice! Rob
		Rumson's the only one doing the
		talking. People want leadership.
		And in the absence of genuine
		leadership, they will listen to
		anyone who steps up to the
		microphone. They want leadership,
		Mr. President. They're so thirsty
		for it, they'll crawl through the
		desert toward a mirage, and when
		they discover there's no water,
		they'll drink the sand.

				SHEPHERD
			   (evenly)
		Lewis, we've had Presidents who were
		beloved, who couldn't find a coherent
		sentence with two hands and a
		flashlight. People don't drink the
		sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis.
		They drink it 'cause they don't know
		the difference.

	The room is slightly stunned by what their President has just
	said.

	SHEPHERD picks up the polling data and heads to the door...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing; on his
			    way out)
		Make the deal.

		MacInerney. There's been a
		development.

	SYDNEY holds for a moment...then heads out the door and we

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

	TROMBONE MUSIC comes from LUCY's bedroom as SHEPHERD rounds
	the corner.

	INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - LATER AFTERNOON

	SHEPHERD pops his head in.

				SHEPHERD
		Sounds good.

				LUCY
		It's progressive.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll say.

				LUCY
		Hey, Dad, what's wrong with Sydney?
		You guys have a fight?

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		What do you mean?

				LUCY
		She seemed pretty--

				SHEPHERD
		You saw her?

				LUCY
		She's here.

				SHEPHERD
		Where?

				LUCY
		In your room. Why is she mad?

				SHEPHERD
		Don't worry about it.

				LUCY
		Were you a dork?

				SHEPHERD
		Practice your music.

				LUCY
		If you were a dork, you should say
		you're sorry. Girls like that.

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. SHEPHERED'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	SYDNEY is going through the closet in search of something.
	The door opens, and SHEPHERD steps in, perhaps a little
	tentatively. He doesn't see SYDNEY at first.

				SHEPHERD
			   (calling out)
		Syd?

	SYDNEY comes out.

				SYDNEY
		Have you seen a gray cableknit
		sweater?

				SHEPHERD
		A grey...sweater? No. I called
		you at the office, but...

				SYDNEY
		It's Beth's. I wore it here one
		time, and I didn't want to leave
		it.

				SHEPHERD
		Where were you going?

	SYDNEY continues her search.

				SYDNEY
		I'm going home, and then I'm going
		to Hartford.

				SHEPHERD
		Connecticut?

				SYDNEY
		Yes. Do you know if it was sent with
		your dry cleaning by any--

				SHEPHERD
		What's in Connecticut?

				SYDNEY
		Richard Reynolds' campaign. He may
		be able to get me a job.

				SHEPHERD
		When did you decide to get a new job?

				SYDNEY
		Not long after Leo Solomon fired me
		from my old one. Beth's gonna kill
		me. She loves that--

				SHEPHERD
		Why did he fire you?

				SYDNEY
		Total failure to achieve any of the
		objectives for which I was hired. I
		told him he was being unreasonable.
		After all, I did get to dance with
		the President and ride in Air Force
		One a couple of times. But you know
		those prickly environmentalists.
		It's always gonna be something with
		them. If it's not clean air, then
		it's clean water. Like it isn't good
		enough that I'm on the cover of
		People Magazine.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll call him.

				SYDNEY
		You'll call him? You mean you'll
		call him yourself? Personally?
		It'll come from the President?
		That's a great idea. I think you
		should call Leo and make a deal. He
		hires me back for, say, 72 days. I
		go around scaring the hell out of
		Congress, making them think that the
		President's about to drive through a
		very damaging and costly bill.
		They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm
		the President's Friday Night Girl.
		Now I don't know if you can dip into
		this well twice, especially since
		I've lost all credibility in politics,
		but you never know, I might just be
		able to pull it off again. I might
		be able to give you just the leverage
		you need to pass some ground-breaking
		piece of crime legislation -- like a
		mandatory three-day waiting period
		before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi.
		Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to
		learn to live with disappointment.

	She starts to exit

				SHEPHERD
		What do you think went on here today?

	She stops.

				SYDNEY
		I know exactly what went on here
		today. I got screwed. You saw the
		poll, you needed the crime bill,
		you couldn't get it on your own,
		so I got screwed.

				SHEPHERD

		The environment got screwed. Nothing
		happened to you today, Sydney.
		Governing is choosing. Governing is
		prioritizing. I've made no secret of
		the fact that the crime bill was my
		top priority.

				SYDNEY
		Well then, congratulations. It's
		only taken you three years to put
		together crime prevention legislation
		that has no hope of preventing crime.

	SYDNEY heads out the door--

				SHEPHERD
			(stopping)
		Sydney. Please. I don't want to
		lose you over this.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, you got bigger
		problems than losing me. You just
		lost my vote.

	And SYDNEY is out the door...

	...we HOLD on SHEPHERD, looking like a man who's taken a lot
	of punches to the heads...

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. THE POOL ROOM - NIGHT

	A rack of billiard balls explodes from the break.

				A.J.
		Hartfort? What's in Hartford?

				SHEPHERD
		Richard Reynolds' district office.
		She's thinking of running his
		campaign. Four in the corner.

	SHEPHERD gets down over the ball--

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Hartford. The insurance capital of
		the world. Have a good time, Syd.

	SHEPHERD smacks the ball, BULL'S-EYE.

				A.J.
		Listen. I'm gonna have Janie clear
		your schedule for the weekend. You
		need to get some rest.

				SHEPHERD
		You handling me, A.J.?

				A.J.
		No, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Good. 14 in the side.

	SHEPHERD gets down over the ball...

	SMACK!!!

	...but instead of the cue hitting the ball, it's A.J.'s palms
	slamming the cue against the table.

				A.J.
		But I sure as hell will if you don't
		start gettin' your head outta your ass.

				SHEPHERD
		Excuse me.

				A.J.
		Lewis is right. Go after this guy.

				SHEPHERD
		Has he lied?!

				A.J.
		What?

				SHEPHERD
		Has Rumson lied in the last seven
		weeks?

				A.J.
		Has he lied?

				SHEPHERD
		Other than not knowing the difference
		between Harvard and Stanford, has he
		said something that isn't true? Am
		I not a Commander-in-Chief who's
		never served in the military? Am I
		not opposed to a Constitutional
		amendment banning flag burning? Am
		I not an unmarried father who was
		sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist
		down the hall from my twelve-year-old
		daughter?

				A.J.
		And you think you're wrong?

				SHEPHERD
		I don't think you win elections by
		telling 59 percent of the people that
		they are.

				A.J.
		We fight the fights we can win.

				SHEPHERD
		Don't--

				A.J.
		You fight the fights that need
		fighting!

				SHEPHERD
		Is the view pretty good from the
		cheap seats, A.J.?

				A.J.
		I beg your pardon.

				SHEPHERD
		It occurs to me that in 25 years I've
		never seen your name on a ballot.
		Why have you always been standing a
		pace behind me?

				A.J.
		Because if I hadn't been, you'd be
		the most popular history professor
		at the University of Wisconsin.

				SHEPHERD
		Fuck you.

	SHEPHERD's tossed his cue stick and is heading out...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Have Lewis put the final drafts of
		the State of the Union and the Crime
		Bill announcement on my desk in the
		morning.

				A.J.
		Yes, sir.

	SHEPHERD gets to the doorway...stops...turns around...

				SHEPHERD
		If Mary hadn't died...would we have
		won three years ago?

				A.J.
		Would we have won?

				SHEPHERD
		If we'd had to go through a character
		debate three years ago, would we have
		won?

				A.J.
		I don't know. But I would've liked
		that campaign. If my friend Andy
		Shepherd had shown up, I would have
		liked that campaign.

	SHEPHERD looks away...nods absently...

				SHEPHERD
			   (pause)
		Yeah.

	SHEPHERD exits, leaving A.J. alone as we

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A series of shots showing SHEPHERD walking down the corridor
	to the dish room, then walking down a long corridor which
	contains a series of paintings of various presidents. Then
	sitting alone in the Oval Office, lost in thought...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. RESIDENCE DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

	SHEPHERD and LUCY are eating breakfast in silence, neither of
	them very happy, each with their own problems. A nearby T.V.
	MONITOR glows with the live coverage of ROBIN's morning press
	briefing.

	Finally...

				SHEPHERD
		You're not hungry?

				LUCY
		This is oatmeal.

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah.

				LUCY
		We never have oatmeal.

				SHEPHERD
		It's good for you.

				LUCY
		I'm from Wisconsin. I need food.

				SHEPHERD
		You're not from Wisconsin. I'm from
		Wisconsin. You've lived in
		Washington your whole life.

	He glances toward the T.V. screen. ROBIN's standing up there
	doing what she's been told: "No comment...No, this President
	is not participating in character debates..." He mutes the
	volume.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		How are you doing in your
		Constitutional debates?

				LUCY
		We're done.

				SHEPHERD
		You're done?

				LUCY
		We ratified it last week.

				SHEPHERD
		Oh...well...that's good. Why didn't
		you tell me?

				LUCY
		It's not a big deal, Dad.

				SHEPHERD
		Okay, I give up. I don't care why
		you're not happy in social studies.
		I care about why you're not talking
		to me about why you're not happy in
		social studies.

				LUCY
		Dad, I'm perfectly--

				SHEPHERD
		You're not perfectly happy. You
		don't think I know when something's
		bothering you?

				LUCY
		Damnit, Dad!

				SHEPHERD
		Hey!

				LUCY
		You know--

				SHEPHERD
		Talk to me.

				LUCY
		Look--

	LUCY winds herself up. It would appear she's about to burst.
	She's about to say the hardest thing she's ever had to say in
	her life--

				LUCY
			   (continuing)
		--sometimes when you talk, you say
		things I disagree with.

	SHEPHERD is stunned and totally confused...

				SHEPHERD
		Almost every time I talk, I say
		things you disagree with.

				LUCY
		I mean politically.

				SHEPHERD
			   (pause)
		Politically?

				LUCY
		Yes.

				SHEPHERD
			   (pause)
		What do you mean?

	It just starts spilling out in a stream--

				LUCY
		Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,
		I'm not sure. You know a lot more
		than I do -- but still, I have these
		feelings, and I don't think they're
		wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm
		not so sure it's all right to burn a
		flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot
		of people, and I don't know why you
		think it's okay. I hear Senator
		Rumson talk, and some of the things
		he says sounds right to me, and I
		think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!
		I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad
		hates this guy!
		Why am I agreeing with him" And then
		I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really
		like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not
		like Dad either." But the point is
		I'm the President's kid, and people
		pay attention to what I say, and if
		I say something different from what
		you say, it'll be embarrassing for
		you. So I can't just get up in social
		studies class and say whatever I want.

	SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely
	no idea...

	He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know
	what's coming...

				SHEPHERD
			   (quietly)
		Stand up please.

	LUCY gets up slowly...

	She's never seen her father like this...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		I want you to pay very close
		attention to what happens now.

	SHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,
	and gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and
	holds her in a tight embrace...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		In your  lifetime, you will never
		embarrass me. It could never happen.
		You're not the President's daughter,
		Lucy, you're mine.
		And no one's gonna vote me out of
		that job. You're my daughter, and
		everything else is a distant second.
			   (more)
		School is for you, Lucy. You say
		what you want. The only thing you
		have to do to make me happy is
		come home at the end of the day.

	LUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a
	long moment.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		One more thing. I don't dislike
		Senator Rumson because of his
		political views. And even if you
		voted for everything he would vote
		for, that wouldn't make you like him.
		There's a fundamental difference
	between you and the Bob Rumsons of
		the world.

				LUCY
		What's that?

				SHEPHERD
		The difference is that he says he
		loves America. Saying you love
		America is easy. What takes
		character -- and this is what you
		have--

	SHEPHERD trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		What takes character is loving
		Americans.
			   (beat)

	And now it's as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the
	longest trip of his life...

	...he looks over at the T.V. monitor..."No comment"...
	"No, I don't know how many other ways I can say it. The
	White House isn't getting involved in..."

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Luce, I gotta go.

				LUCY
		Dad, is everything all right?

				SHEPHERD
		Everything's fine. I'm just a little
		late for work.

	He heads for the door, shouting out as he goes--

				SHEPHERD
		Somebody get my daughter some food!
		The girl's from Wisconsin, for cryin'
		out loud!

	And he's gone as we...

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

	ROBIN is on her last drops of energy and patience.

				REPORTER #4
		Robin, will the President ever
		respond to Senator Rumson's
		question about being a member of
		the American Civil Liberties Union?

	But instead of hands going up, the PRESS CORPS suddenly
	stands. ROBIN turns to see SHEPHERD stride in and step up to
	the podium.

				SHEPHERD
		Yes, he will. 'Morning.

				ROBIN
		Good morning, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD takes the podium. There's a palpable BUZZ in the
	room as video operators adjust their equipment, etc. People
	starts to stand.

				SHEPHERD
		That's all right, you can keep your
		seats. For the last couple of
		months, Senator Rumson has suggested
		that being president of this country
		was, to a certain extent, about
		character...

	ANGLE - ROBIN

	who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in
	four numbers.

	She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the
	rest of the room.

				ROBIN
			   (into phone)
		Lewis...call A.J. and come on down
		here...I don't know, but
		something's happening.

				SHEPHERD
		...and although I have not been
		willing to engage in his attacks on
		me, I've been here three years and
		three days, and I can tell you
		without hesitation: Being President
		of this country is entirely about
		character.

	LEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		For the record: Yes, I am a card-
		carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But
		the more important question is why
		aren't you, Bob? This is an
		organization whose sole purpose is to
		defend the Bill of Rights, so it
		naturally begs the questions.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Why would a senator, his party's most
		powerful spokesman and a candidate
		for president, choose to reject
		upholding the Constitution? If you
		can answer that question, then,
		folks, you're smarter than I am,
		because I didn't understand it until
		a couple of minutes ago. Everybody
		knows American isn't easy. America is
		advanced citizenship.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's
		gonna put up a fight. It's gonna
		say, "You want free speech? Let's
		see you acknowledge a man whose words
		make your blood boil, who's standing
		center stage and advocating, at the
		top of his lungs, that which you
		would spend a lifetime opposing at the
		top of yours. You want to claim
		this land as the land of the free,
		then the symbol of your country can't
		just be a flag; the symbol also has
		to be one of its citizens exercising
		his right to burn that flag in
		protest." Show me that, defend that,
		celebrate that in your classrooms.
		Then you can stand up and sing about
		the land of the free. I've known Bob
		Rumson for years. I've been operating
		under the assumption that the reason
		Bob devotes so much time and energy to
		shouting at the rain was that he simply
		didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't
		get it. Bob's problem is that he
		can't sell it. Nobody has ever won
		an election by talking about what I
		was just talking about.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		This is a country made up of people
		with hard jobs that they're terrified
		of losing. The roots of freedom are
		of little or no interest to them at
		the moment. We are a nation afraid
		to go out at night. We're a society
		that has assigned low priority to
		education and has looked the other
		way while our public schools have
		been decimated. We have serious
		problems to solve, and we need
		serious men to solve them. And
		whatever your particular problem is,
		friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
		not the least bit interested in
		solving it. He is interested in two
		things and two things only: Making
		you afraid of it and telling you
		who's to blame for it. That, ladies
		and gentlemen, is how you win
		elections. You gather a group of
		middle-aged, middle-class, middle-
		income voters who remember with
		longing an easier time, and you talk
		to them about family and American
		values and personal character. Then
		you have an old photo of the
		President's girlfriend. You scream
		about patriotism and you tell them
		she's to blame for their lot in life,
		you go on television and you call her
		a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
		nothing to you, Bob. She has done
		nothing but put herself through law
		school, prosecute criminals for five
		years, represent the interests of
		public school teachers for two years,
		and lobby for the safety of our
		natural resources.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		You want a character debate? Fine,
		but you better stick with me, 'cause
		Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
		league. I've loved two women in my
		life. I lost one to cancer, and I
		lost the other 'cause I was so busy
		keeping my job I forgot to do my job.
		Well that ends right now.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Tomorrow morning the White House is
		sending a bill to Congress for its
		consideration. It's White House
		Resolution 455, an energy bill
		requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
		emission of fossil fuels over the
		next ten years. It is by far the
		most aggressive stride ever taken in
		the fight to reverse the effects of
		global warming. The other piece of
		legislation is the crime bill. As of
		today it no longer exists. I'm
		throwing it out. I'm throwing it out
		and writing a law that makes sense.
		You cannot address crime prevention
		without getting rid of assault
		weapons and handguns.
		I consider them a threat to national
		security, and I will go door to door
		if I have to, but I'm gonna convince
		Americans that I'm right, and I'm
		gonna get the guns. We've got
		serous problems, and we need serious
		men, and if you want to talk about
		character, Bob, you'd better come at
		me with more than a burning flag and
		a membership card. If you want to
		talk about character and American
		values, fine. Just tell me where and
		when, and I'll show up. This is a
		time for serious men, Bob, and your
		fifteen minutes are up. My name's
		Andrew Shepherd, and I am the
		President.

	SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his
	wake.

	The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking
	among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they
	just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.

				ROBIN
		Any questions?

				A.J.
		Lewis, call the printer.

		I know. Gotta rewrite the State of

				A.J.
		Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new

		Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed.

				SHEPHERD
		I don't want the limo. I don't want

	A.J. enters.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		I want a plain, ordinary, non-
		bullet-proof automobile. Someone
		around here must have a Chevy I
		can borrow. Well, find one and
		meet me outside the West Wing
		entrance in five minutes.

				A.J.
		Where are you going?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm going to her house. I'm gonna
		stand at her front door till she
		lets me in. And I'm not leaving till
		I get her back.

				A.J.
		How're you gonna do that?

				SHEPHERD
		I haven't worked that out yet. But
		I'm sure groveling will be involved.

				A.J.
		You're just gonna drive over?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the
		most powerful army in the world.
		You don't think I can drive ten blocks?

				SYDNEY
		Just stay away from DuPont Circle.
		I hear it's murder this time of day.

	SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing
	in the doorway, but of course he does anyway.

				SYDNEY
		Hi, A.J.

				A.J.
		It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If
		anybody needs me, I'll be in the
		Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.

	A.J. exits.

				SYDNEY
		I heard your speech. I was in my
		car, and it just kind of steered
		its way over here.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm glad.

	SYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and
	smile. SYDNEY starts toward him.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Sydney, I didn't decide to send
		455 to the floor to get you back.

				SYDNEY
		I didn't come back 'cause you decided
		to send 455 to the floor.

	They move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because...

				LEWIS

	room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JANIE,
	and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around in
	a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff
	links.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm having a cuff links crisis.

	LUCY takes his sleeves.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing; to LUCY)
		I think they've locked.

				LUCY
		Hold still.

	ROBIN steps in.

				ROBIN
		Mr. President, they're waiting for
		you.


				LUCY
		All done.

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis.

				LEWIS
		Sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Things have been a little rough
		between us lately.

				LEWIS
		I know sir, I'm sorry.

				SHEPHERD
		Don't stop what you're doing.

				LEWIS
		That's kind of you, sir, but I
		realize I've been a little
		insensitive about some personal...

				SHEPHERD
		No, you were right. Two hundred and
		sixty-four million people don't give
		a damn about my life.

				LEWIS
		Just so you know I've never been one
		of them, Mr. President.

				ROBIN
		This way, people. Let's go.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to LEWIS)
		See you after.

	The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit,
	ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as
	she herds people out the door.

	LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered
	textbook and has it opened to a specific page...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Whatcha got there, Luce?

				LUCY
		Article 2, Section 3, of the U.S.
		Constitution. Executive Powers.
			   (reading)
		"He shall, from time to time, give to
		the Congress information of the State
		of the Union, and recommend to their
		consideration such measures as he
		shall judge necessary and expedient."

				A.J.
		Sounds right up your alley.

	SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a
	deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then
	pulls him into a strong embrace.

	A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		Give 'em hell, Andy.

	A.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without
	having to speak--

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		Thank you.
			   (to LUCY)
		I'll see you afterward. I want a
		critique.

	The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the
	First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		There's been something I've been
		trying to give you since our first
		date. I tried a bunch of times, but
		somehow I've always managed to trip
		over my job.
			   (beat)
		Anyay...

	SHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold
	Presidential seal.

	He reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		These are for you.

				SYDNEY
		They're beautiful.

	JANIE pokes her head in.

				JANIE
		Mr. President?

				SHEPHERD
		Gotta go.

				SYDNEY
		Should I stay here?

				SHEPHERD
		No, walk with me.

	They exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS,
	SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,
	most prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK.

	SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double
	doors to the House Chamber--

				SYDNEY
		How'd you finally do it?

				SHEPHERD
			   (raising his voice
			    above the cheering)
		Do what?

				SYDNEY
		Manage to give a woman flowers and
		be President at the same time.

				SHEPHERD
		Well...it turns out I've got a rose
		garden.

	SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--

	--the doors to the Chamber fly open--

				DOORKEEPER
		Mr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
		UNITED STATES!!!

	The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,
	shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...

	At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain
	their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to
	get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both
	hands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking
	hands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and we

	FADE OUT.

	MAIN TITLES END ON


	EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come
	over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
	before we

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY

	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private
	elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.

				AGENT COOPER
		Liberty's moving.

	Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is
	followed a step or two later by

	PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.

	SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,
	professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.

				JANIE
		The 10:15 event's been moved inside
		to the Indian Treaty Room.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to Janie)
		The 10:15 is American Fisheries?

				JANIE
		Yes, sir. They're giving you a
		200-pound halibut.

				SHEPHERD
		Janie, make a note. We need to
		schedule more events where somebody
		gives me a really big fish.

	JANIE starts to make a note.

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Janie, I was kidding.

				JANIE
		Of course, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		       (to the AGENT at the
		        elevator)
		Hey, Cooper.

				AGENT COOPER
		'Morning, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...

				JANIE
		Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
		with you this morning.

				SHEPHERD
		Is he upset about the speech last night?

				JANIE
		He seemed concerned.

				SHEPHERD
		Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
		unless Lewis was concerned about
		something I did Sunday night.

	The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,
	LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It
	would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,
	though that doesn't seem to slow him down.

				LEWIS
		You skipped the whole paragraph.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to Janie)
		And Monday morning it is.

	LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
	double doors leading to the South Lawn.

				LEWIS
		"American can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society"...and then nothing. You
		dumped the whole handguns paragraph.

				SHEPHERD
		This is a time for prudence, Lewis.

				LEWIS
		That was the kick-ass section.

	The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
	the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
	Wing.

				SHEPHERD
		I thought what with being the
		President and all...

				LEWIS
		Sir, of course I didn't mean to
		imply--

				SHEPHERD
		I thought you'd be turning cartwheels
		this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job
		approval.

				LEWIS
		That's great news, sir, but...

	They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.

				GROUNDKEEPER
		'Morning, Mr. President.

	Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,
	JANIE quickly and quietly said--

				JANIE
		Charlie.

				SHEPHERD
		'Morning, Charlie.

				LEWIS
		Sir, the press is gonna need an
		explanation.

				SHEPHERD
		For what?

	SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
	open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make
	their way through the corridors of


	INT. THE WEST WING - DAY

	They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES
	AND OFFICE WORKERS.

				LEWIS
		Because you dropped the whole kick-ass
		section, now we've got this thing hanging
		out there.

				SHEPHERD
		There's a thing hanging out there?

				LEWIS
		"Americans can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society." Then ...nothing. No
		explanation. No context. So now it's
		just this thing.

				SHEPHERD
		And it's hanging out there?

				LEWIS
		Yes, sir.

	SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--

				SHEPHERD
		Maria--

				STAFFER (MARIA)
		Good morning, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Did they tell you I'm gonna need--

				STAFFER (MARIA)
		--overall consumer spending and not
		just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have
		it for you in 15 minutes.

				SHEPHERD
		Thanks.

	SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.

				LEWIS
		Mr. President, I really feel we need
		to focus on...

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis, however much coffee you drink
		in the morning, I want you to reduce it
		by half.

				LEWIS
		I don't drink coffee.

				SHEPHERD
		Then hit yourself over the head with
		a baseball bat, would you please?

	Another STAFFER crosses their path--

				JANIE
		Happy birthday, Laura.

				SHEPHERD
		Hey, Laura, happy birthday.

				STAFFER (LAURA)
		Thank you, sir.

	Once out of earshot--

				SHEPHERD
			(to JANIE)
		I should send her some flowers.

				JANIE
		You already did, sir.

	And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into


	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,
	is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD
	walks in--

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Good morning, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		How're you, Mrs. Chapil?

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left
		the detailed breakdown of the approval
		poll for you. He seemed to indicate that
		it was very good news.

				SHEPHERD
		Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

	And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has
	gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
	briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used
	to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,
	listening, and talking at the same time.

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Lucy called just a moment ago. You
		forgot to sign her permission slip
		for her class--

				JANIE
		--the museum trip. I'll go get it.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to JANIE)
		What time does she get home today?

				JANIE
		Three-twenty.

				SHEPHERD
		How's my afternoon look?

				JANIE
		Very crowded.

				SHEPHERD
		Schedule some time for me at 3:30.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.

	This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the
	President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.

				SHEPHERD
		Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico?

				ROBIN
		I didn't truly appreciate it until I
		came back and discovered that America
		isn't a great society.

				LEWIS
			   (to ROBIN)
		He dumped a whole section.

				SHEPHERD
		Now there's a thing hanging out there.

				ROBIN
		Not a great society, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		Well, with you out of the country, it
		wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,
		we're great again.

				ROBIN
		There's a press room full of people
		saying "What did he mean by that?"

				LEWIS
		See?

				SHEPHERD
			   (re: a memo he's been
			    looking at)
		A.J., did you get one of these?

	This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a
	separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition
	to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,
	he's the President's closest and oldest friend.

				A.J.
		Is that the letter from Solomon at
		the GDC?

				SHEPHERD
		It would appear to be a letter from
		the entire environmental community.
		These people are outta control.

				A.J.
		I think they're just frustrated,
		Mr. President.

				ROBIN
		Are they blaming the President for
		global warming?

				A.J.
		Well, they don't think he caused it,
		if that's what you mean.

			   (continuing;
			    to SHEPHERD)
		Sir, I'm on the phone with these
		people twice a week. I honestly
		don't know what they want at this
		point.

				LEWIS
		What they want is a 20 percent reduction in
		fossil fuel emissions.

				A.J.
		It won't pass at 20 percent.

				LEWIS
		We haven't really tried.

				A.J.
		Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
		hold too many markers. If we try to
		push this through and lose, there will
		be a very loud thud when we hit the
		ground, and that's not what you want in
		an election year.

				SHEPHERD
		Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
		the President resents the implication
		that he's turned his back on the
		environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
		the floor. But we're gonna ask for a
		10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
		their support, fine. At 63 percent job
		approval rating. I don't need their help
		getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--
		where's Leon?

				A.J.
			   (to an AIDE)
		Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him
		the President's--

	A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
	pedestrian collision in the outer office--

				MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)
		Aaagh!

				KODAK (O.S.)
		Sorry! Sorry, my fault.

				A.J.
			   (to the AIDE)
		Never mind.

	LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House
	pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along
	with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's
	Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close
	over the past few years.

				KODAK
		Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		You all right?

				KODAK
		They keep moving that big ficus plant.

				A.J.
		We're all here, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		Okay. First, I wanted to say
		congratulations. Three years ago, we
		were elected to the White House by
		one of the narrowest margins in history,
		and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
		registered voters think we're doing a
		good job.

				KODAK
		Wait a second. You wanted me to poll
		registered voters?

	Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...

				SHEPHERD
		But the poll also tells us what we
		already knew: We don't get this
		crime bill of ours through Congress
		and these numbers are gonna be a
		memory. So, starting today, we're
		shifting it into gear.

				ROBIN
		Can I tell my morning press gaggle
		that gun control--

				A.J.
		Crime control, Robin. Gun control
		means we're wimps and we're soft on
		crime.

				LEWIS
		Hang on, are we not--

				A.J.
		Lewis--

				LEWIS
		Are we not putting back the handgun
		restrictions?!

				A.J.
		We're leaving 'em out.

				LEWIS
		Sir, we campaigned on this issue.
		Now, I understand we took it out when
		we were in the low forties, but we
		can push it through now.

				SHEPHERD
		After the elections.

				LEWIS
		Sir, we may never have an opportunity
		like this again. Let's take this 63
		percent out for a spin and see what
		it can do.

				SHEPHERD
		We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
		We need it to get re-elected. For
		reasons passing understanding, people
		do not relate guns to gun-related crime.

				A.J.
		Robin, you can brief the press this
		afternoon. As of today, the crime
		bill's priority one on the President's
		domestic agenda.

				ROBIN
		Got it.

				A.J.
		Leon, you're gonna run the war room.
		We're gonna need detailed projections
		for all the target districts by the
		end of the week. And, Leon, don't be
		a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
		what the N.R.A. does.

				KODAK
		Scare the shit out of 'em?

				A.J.
		Yeah.

				KODAK
		I can do that.

				A.J.
		Lewis, we want you to be legislative
		liaison on this. You're gonna run
		the show on the hill.

				LEWIS
		Can I just say, to return to the
		subject for one moment, that it might
		be easier to fight a war on drugs if
		we weren't arming drug dealers.

	SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
	temper.

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights
		we can win.

				LEWIS
		Yes, sir.

				A.J.
		We want to announce the crime bill at
		the State of the Union, which is 72
		days from today. The last nose count
		put us 18 votes short.

				SHEPHERD
		Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you,
		everyone. Janie, what's next?

				A.J.
		Thank you, Mr. President.

	The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank
	you, Mr. President"'s as they exit.

				JANIE
		Security briefing, sir.

                                                            CUT TO:

	EXT. THE WASHINGTON BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY

	It's around 10 o'clock the same morning as the capital district,
	in its own way, is showing signs of the approaching Thanksgiving
	and Christmas holidays.


	EXT. A CHROME AND GLASS BUILDING - DAY

	On the seventh floor of the building. A RECEPTIONIST tells us
	where we are by answering the phone--

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		Global Defense Council...

				SUSAN (V.O.)
		You wanted to see me?

				LEO (V.O.)
		I just got off the phone with A.J.
		MacInerney.

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY

	LEO, a white-haired man in his early 60's is meeting with
	SUSAN SLOAN, a 40'ish lawyer who seems to go out of her way
	to create an issue where none exists.

				SUSAN
		Did the President read the letter?

				LEO
		The President's pissed as hell,
		Susan. That letter was a stupid move.

				SUSAN
		It was aggressive, and we should
		stand by every--

				LEO
		This isn't the guy who needed us four
		years ago, Susan. He's incredibly
		popular. He's gonna win re-election
		in a walk, and he could give a shit
		what we stand by! If the President
		passes the most important piece of
		environmental legislation in history,
		and does it despite our negative
		endorsement, our political weight in
		the future will rank somewhere below
		the Save the Spotted Owl Society.
			   (beat)
		I'm bringing in some help.


				SUSAN
		We don't need another environmental
		expert to confirm what every other
		environmental expert--

				LEO
		Not an environmental expert, a
		professional political strategist.
		We're playing hardball with Andrew
		Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.

				SUSAN
		Who?

				LEO
		Sydney Ellen Wade.

				SUSAN
		Oh Christ. That woman doesn't know
		the first thing about the
		environmental lobby.

				LEO
		She's a closer, Susan. She gets the
		job done.

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	SHEPHERD and LEWIS -- working on a speech.

				SHEPHERD
		Try it like this and lose that.

				ROBIN
			   (entering)
		David Sasser from the Times called
		and wanted to know what the White
		House felt was a great society.

				LEWIS
		What did you tell him?

				ROBIN
		I told him I couldn't speak for the
		President, but for my money: Bermuda.

				SHEPHERD
		Perfect.

	JANIE steps in--

				JANIE
		Mr. President, your cousin Judith's
		come down with the flu and won't be
		able to join you Thursday night.

				SHEPHERD
		That's too bad. Remind me to give
		her a call later.

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				ROBIN
		You gonna go stag?

				SHEPHERD
		That's not a problem.

				ROBIN
		No. We've never gone wrong parading
		you around as the lonely widower.

	The words came out casually, but they instantly freeze everyone.

				ROBIN
			   (continuing)
		My God.
		         (beat)
		I can't believe I said that.
			   (beat)
		Mr. President, that was an incredibly
		thoughtless remark. I would never
		dream of insulting you or the memory
		of your wife.

				SHEPHERD
		That's okay, forget it.
			    (to JANIE)
		What time is it?

				JANIE
		It's 3:45, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm gonna go over and say hi to Lucy.

				JANIE
		You have the Attorney General at 4:00
		and the trade representative at 4:30.
		Somewhere in there you promised NPR
		five minutes.

				ROBIN
		Mr. President--

				SHEPHERD
		Robin, don't worry about it.

	INT. THE RESIDENCE - DAY

	We HEAR the sound of a TROMBONE being played--not well--from
	one of the rooms. SHEPHERD comes around and down the corridor.

	He walks into--


	INT. LUCY'S ROOM - DAY

	LUCY, Shepherd's 12-year-old daughter, stops playing.

				SHEPHERD
		No, keep going. I liked what you
		were playing? What's it called?

				LUCY
		Scales.

				SHEPHERD
		Well... you play it with gusto!

				LUCY
		Are my lips swollen?

				SHEPHERD
		Are they supposed to be?

				LUCY
		Yeah.

				SHEPHERD
		Then you're doing fine.

				LUCY
		Whatcha got behind your back?

				SHEPHERD
		A little gift.

				LUCY
		Is it a dirt bike?

				SHEPHERD
		Nope.

	He hands her an old textbook ...

				LUCY
		Is it a really old seventh-grade
		textbook of yours that you're gonna
		make me read cover to cover and
		discuss at dinner and drive me crazy
		with?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm not comfortable with the "really
		old" part, but everything else you
		said was true.

				LUCY
			   (reading the cover)
		"Understanding the Constitution."

				SHEPHERD
		Your social studies teacher said your
		class would be starting on the
		Constitution this week.

				LUCY
		You talked to Mr. Linder?

				SHEPHERD
		Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher
		Conference. Mr. Linder and I were
		the key player in that discussion.
		Why don't you like social studies,
		Luce?

				LUCY
		I like it fine, Dad.

				SHEPHERD
		All your other teachers say you're
		happy, you're enthusiastic, you've
		always got your hand up...Mr. Linder
		says you don't participate unless he
		calls on you, and even then it's a
		one-word answer.

				LUCY
		I don't know what to say, Dad. I
		guess I'm just not...I don't know.

				SHEPHERD
		Luce, take a look at this book. This
		is exciting stuff. It's about who we
		are and what we want. Read what it
		says on the first page.

				LUCY
			   (reading)
		"Property of Gilmore Junior High
		School."

				SHEPHERD
		The next page.

				LUCY
			   (reading)
		"We, the People, of the United States,
		in order to form a more perfect union..."

				SHEPHERD
		See? Grabs you right off the bat.
		It's a page-turner.

				LUCY
		I can't wait.

				SHEPHERD
		Good, 'cause it's possible the subject
		might come up at dinner tonight.

				LUCY
		Do you see it as part of your job to
		torture me?

				SHEPHERD
		No, it's just one of the perks. See
		you tonight.

	He gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door.
	Behind him, he hears Lucy's rendition of "Hail to the Chief."
	SHEPHERD shoots her a look as we

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

	Where SHEPHERD is finishing a meeting with the DEFENSE
	SECRETARY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS and a NATIONAL
	SECURITY ADVISOR, each of whom is accompanied by at least one
	DEPUTY or AIDE. A.J. is also present.

				DEFENSE SECRETARY
		The C-STAD hardware's been in place

				A.J.
		How soon can you deploy them?

				CHAIRMAN
		We can airlift 'em in the morning.
		They'll have C-STAD operational in 20
		days.

				A.J.
		Any security concerns?

				SECURITY ADVISOR
		If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd
		have hit it by now.

				SHEPHERD
		Okay. Let's move on it. Thank you,
		gentlemen.

	SHEPHERD and A.J. leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of
	"good-bye" 's and "Thank you, Mr. President"'s.
	They pass MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil.

				MRS. CHAPIL
		You too, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD starts his walk from the West Wing back to the
	residence.

	It is the exact reverse of the path he took to the OVAL OFFICE
	in the morning.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll see you in the morning, Janie.

				JANIE
		You will, Mr. President.

	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT follows at a distance.

				AGENT #2
			   (sotto)
		Liberty is moving.

				A.J.
		Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun
		at the GDC.

				SHEPHERD
		It's about time.

				A.J.
		She's a lawyer from Virginia named
		Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman
		well. She's had a lot of success
		getting congressmen elected.

				SHEPHERD
		Maybe we should try to steal her.
		Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them
		leave the room till they're clear
		about that.

				A.J.
		You know, if you've got a free second,
		maybe you could stop in and say hello.
		It might smooth the way.

				SHEPHERD
		Mention it to Janie.

				A.J.
		Good.

				SHEPHERD
		Then let's clear this off the table
		and get everybody focused on the
		crime bill. I don't want to win
		this. I want to win it by a couple of
		touchdowns.

				A.J.
		We will, Mr. President.

		              SHEPHERD
		Good.

	A.J. starts to leave. SHEPHERD stops him.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		A.J.?

				A.J.
		Yes?

				SHEPHERD
		Listen, Robin said something to me
		today that I'm sure she wouldn't have
		said it if...I mean, she wasn't saying
		it to me, I realize...
			   (beat)
		Ah, never mind. Have a good night.

				A.J.
		Good night, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		A.J., when we're out of the office
		and we're alone, you can call me Andy.

				A.J.
		I beg your pardon?

				SHEPHERD
		I mean you were the best man at my
		wedding, for crying out loud. Call
		me Andy.

				A.J.
			   (laughing off the
			    suggestion)
		Whatever you say, Mr. President.

	They have reached the south entrance to the White House.

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		Have a good night, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Good night, A.J.

	SHEPHERD enters the White House.

	EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	It's early morning of the following day, and the grounds
	outside are in full swing.


	EXT. THE NORTHWEST EXECUTIVE ENTRANCE - DAY

	In front of the guardhouse, Susan and her new colleague,
	SYDNEY ELLEN WADE, are being cleared.

				SYDNEY
			   (to the GUARD)
		Hi, my name's Sydney Ellen Wade.

				SUSAN
		He just needs your driver's license.

	SUSAN hands the guard her license.

				SYDNEY
			   (handing him her
			    license)
		I'm from Virginia.

				SUSAN
		He doesn't care.

				SYDNEY
			   (to the GUARD)
		I'm here for a meeting with Mr.
		MacInerney.

				SUSAN
		He doesn't need to know that.

	The GUARD BUZZES her through the gate.

				SYDNEY
			   (to the GUARD)
		Forgive me, this is my first time at
		the White House. I'm trying to savor
		the Capra-esque quality.

				SUSAN
		He doesn't know what Capra-esque
		means.

				GUARD
			   (to SUSAN)
		Yeah, I do. Frank Capra, great
		American director -- It's a Wonderful
		Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.
			   (handing SYDNEY and SUSAN
			    their laminated passes)
		Sydney Ellen Wade of Virginia. Knock
		'em dead.

				SYDNEY
		Thanks.

	SYDNEY and SUSAN begin to walk up the path toward the entrance
	to the West Wing.

	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	A meeting with the EDUCATION SECRETARY, the HUD SECRETARY,
	several AIDES and LEWIS is breaking up. SHEPHERD is ushering
	people out.

				SHEPHERD
		The day the government starts
		subsidizing private schools is the
		day we give up on public education.

			EDUCATION SECRETARY
		I know the proposal only scratches
		the surface, but it's the least we
		can do.

				SHEPHERD
		We're already doing the least we can
		do, but I can't think of anything
		better, so we'll go with this for now.
			   (to HUD SECRETARY)
		Jerry, say hello to Linda for me.
		And if I don't see you again, have a
		good Thanksgiving.

				HUD SECRETARY
		Thank you, Mr. President.

	The room has cleared...JANIE is arranging new papers on the
	President's desk.

				SHEPHERD
		How're we doing?

				JANIE
		You're running four minutes ahead of
		schedule.

				SHEPHERD
		Ahead?

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			   (exited)
		Janie, this is unprecedented. I don't
		know what to do with myself.

				JANIE
		Mr. MacInerney asked me to remind you
		to pop your head in on--

				SHEPHERD
		The GDC meeting. Right.

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY

				A.J.
		Your concerns are not falling on deaf
		ears. The environmental lobby has
		known no greater alley in the White
		House than President Shepherd.

				SYDNEY
		Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.

	SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable--

				SUSAN
		Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney
		alone now. He's already given us more
		time than--

				SYDNEY
		Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want
		us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's
		not yet done what he needs to do today.

				SUSAN
		Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the
		deep end of the pool on her first day.
		She hasn't even had a chance to read
		the report of the Quebec Conference.

	SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes,
	check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides,
	instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching
	this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.

				SYDNEY
		You're right. I haven't read it. If
		someone had asked me yesterday, I'd
		have told them the Quebec Conference
		was made up of six professional hockey
		teams. But what I do know is that it's
		time for the President to run for
		president again. Leon Kodak is as good
		as it gets when it comes to electoral
		strategy, and I'm certain he's told the
		President exactly what I'd tell him:
		Nail down Michigan and California,
		where they make cars and airplanes --
		and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if
		I had read these eight hundred pages,
		I would have discovered that it's the
		burning of fossil fuels that's been
		mostly responsible for global warming and
		that the 20 percent reduction recommended
		by the GDC is a necessary first step
		toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
		effect that has gone unchecked by this
		administration...

				SUSAN
			   (to SYDNEY)
		It's really time to--

				SYDNEY
		Susan, I promise you, the White House
		Chief of Staff will not let us leave
		here until he's broken the bad news.

	No one in the room really understands what's going on...
	except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire
	SYDNEY but, of course, can't.

				A.J.
			   (pause)
		I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although
		not about Michigan and California.
		The President has asked me to convey
		to you that he's sending his energy
		bill to the floor with a call for a
		reduction of 10 percent.

	There's an uncomfortable silence in the room...

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		The President is willing to go it
		alone on this, but he's asking for,
		and frankly he's expecting, the full
		support of the GDC.

				SYDNEY
		The President's expecting our full
		support?

				A.J.
		Yes, he is.

				SYDNEY
		The President's dreamin', A.J.

				SUSAN
		Sydney!

				SYDNEY
		--the President has critically
		misjudged reality. If he honestly
		thinks that the environmental
		community is going to whistle a
		happy tune while rallying support
		around this pitifully lame mockery of
		environmental leadership just because
		he's a nice guy and he's done better
		than his predecessors, then your boss
		is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Let's take him out back and beat the
		shit out of him.

	SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the
	direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in
	person, The President of the United States.

	She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought
	process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on
	her head right now.

				A.J.
		Good morning, Mr. President. How are
		you today?

				SHEPHERD
		Couldn't be better.
			   (to the GROUP)
		I apologize for the interruption, but
		A.J. asked me to stop and say hello.
		You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by
		any chance, would you?

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, I'm...don't know what
		to say. I'm speechless.

				SHEPHERD
		All evidence to the contrary.

				SUSAN
		Mr. President, we haven't met. My
		name is Susan Sloan. I used to work
		with Congressman Myers. I hope this
		episode in no way--

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney?

				SYDNEY
		Yes, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		You got a second?

				SYDNEY
			   (quietly)
		Of course.

	SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s
	office and into the hallway.

				SHEPHERD
		I thought maybe we might have a word
		in private. Someplace a little less
		intimidating.
			   (calling)
		Janie?

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to SYDNEY)
		This is my personal assistant, Janie
		Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms.
		Wade into the rec room. I'll be there
		in a second.

	SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues
	down the hallway.

				JANIE
			   (to SYDNEY)
		This way...

	JANIE leads SYDNEY into...


	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing
	whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper
	on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to
	notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of
	the United States, the bust of Lincoln...

	SHEPHERD strides in--

				SHEPHERD
		Sorry to keep you waiting.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President--

				SHEPHERD
		Is it okay if I call you Sydney?

				SYDNEY
		Of course. Mr. President--

				SHEPHERD
		Have you ever been in the Oval Office?

				SYDNEY
		I've just been on the regular tour.
		It didn't include...

				SHEPHERD
		I hear it's pretty good.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, what you saw in there
		was nothing more than vanity run amok.
		I was showing off for a colleague who
		doesn't think very much of me. It'd
		be a real injustice for you to hold the
		GDC accountable for my behavior today.
		On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry
		for having insulted you like that.

				SHEPHERD
		Are you under the impression that I'm
		mad at you?

				SYDNEY
			   (pause)
		Well...

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, seldom does a day go by that
		I'm not burned in effigy.

				SYDNEY
		Not by a professional political
		operative standing 30 feet from the
		Oval Office.

				SHEPHERD
		No, I'll give you that.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President--

				SHEPHERD
		Did you know that when the City
		Planners sat down to design
		Washington, D.C., their intention was
		to build a city that would intimidate
		and humble foreign heads of state?
		It's true.

				SYDNEY
		I didn't know that.


				SHEPHERD
		The White House has the single
		greatest home court advantage in the
		modern world.

				SYDNEY
		Learned that one the hard way.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, this bill is important to me.

				SYDNEY
		Yes, sir, I'll convey your message.

				SHEPHERD
		But you don't believe me?

				SYDNEY
		The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
		It's a long shot at 10.

				SYDNEY
		How do you know that until you put
		the full weight of the White House
		behind--

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes
		shy in the House. It can't be done.
		But I tell you what. I'll make you a
		deal with you. If you can get 24
		votes, I'll get you the last 10.

				SYDNEY
		Twenty-four votes?

				SHEPHERD
		If you can swing 24 votes by the
		State of the Union, I'll promise you
		full White House support.

				SYDNEY
		Do I have your word on that, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry?
		I skipped breakfast. You wanna have
		some coffee? A donut or something?

				SYDNEY
		Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my
		surroundings, and yes, I've gotten
		off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
		beginning, but don't let that
		diminish the weight of my message:
		The GDC has been at every president
		for the last decade and a half that
		global warming is a calamity, the
		effects of which will be second only
		to nuclear war. The best scientists
		in the world have given you every
		reason to take the GDC seriously.
		But I'm gonna give you one more. If
		you don't live up to the deal you
		just made, come New Hampshire, we're
		gonna go shopping for a new candidate.

	SYDNEY heads for the door--

				SHEPHERD
		You can't do that, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		With all due respect, Mr. President,
		who's gonna stop me?

				SHEPHERD
		Well, if you go through that door,
		the United States Secret Service.
		That's my private office.
			      (pointing)
               You need to go out that way.

				SYDNEY
			   (beat)
		Ah.

	SYDNEY, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the
	Oval Office. SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired.

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. THE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second floor
	residence. His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is
	something he does almost as well as being President. A.J.
	stands to the side with his pool cue.

				A.J.
		McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know
		we're making our move on the crime
		bill. They're circling the wagons on
		the assault weapons.

				SHEPHERD
		Should I meet with them?

				A.J.
		Let Lewis take a pass at them first.

				SHEPHERD
		Fine. 2 in the side.

	SHEPHERD sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket.

				A.J.
		Nice shot, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't
		call me by my name when we're playing
		pool.

	A.J. assesses the table.

				A.J.
		I will not do it playing pool, I will
		not do it in a school, I do not like
		green eggs and ham, I do not like
		them Sam I am.

				SHEPHERD
		At ease, A.J., and get away from the
		pocket. 9 in the corner.

	SHEPHERD makes the shot.

				A.J.
		Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was
		thrilled with the deal you made this
		morning.

	SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it
	there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.

				SHEPHERD
		I forgot to tell you.

				A.J.
		It's a waste of time.

				SHEPHERD
		Not our time. GDC makes a big
		push for the votes, and when they
		come up short, we move in with the
		softer bill, to get passed, we're
		everybody's hero. 3 in the side.

				A.J.
		Also, Sydney Wade called.

	SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney Wade?

				A.J.
			   (beat)
		She wanted to apologize one more time
		for her behavior. 3 in the side.

				SHEPHERD
		Did she say anything about me?

				A.J.
			   (beat)
		Sydney Wade?

				SHEPHERD
		When she called.

				A.J.
		Did she say anything about you?
		13 in the corner.

				SHEPHERD
		No, it's just that we had a nice
		couple of minutes together. She
		threatened me and I patronized her
		and we didn't have anything to eat,
		but I thought there was a connection.

	A.J. is staring at him in disbelief.

				SHEPHERD
		She didn't say anything about me?

				A.J.
			(quietly)
		Well, no, but I could pass her a note
		before study hall and--

				SHEPHERD
		Tell me this: Hypothetically, what
		would happen--

				A.J.
		I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in
		the corner.

	He misses the shot.

				SHEPHERD
		--if I called Sydney and asked her
		to be my date at the State Dinner
		Thursday night?

				A.J.
		You're not serious.

				SHEPHERD
		Don't I sound serious?

				A.J.
		The President can't just go out on
		a date.

				SHEPHERD
		Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.

				A.J.
		You're not--

				SHEPHERD
		Wilson was widowed during his first
		term. He meets a woman named Edith
		Gault. He dated her, courted her,
		married her, and somewhere in there
		managed to form the League of Nations.

				A.J.
		Mr. President, this is an election
		year. If you're looking for female
		companionship, we can make
		arrangements that'll insure total
		privacy and--

				SHEPHERD
		I don't want you to get me a girl,
		A.J. What is this, Vegas?

				A.J.
		No, sir, this is the White House.

				SHEPHERD
		And I'm talking about something
		that in no way is at conflict with
		my oath of office. I'm a single
		adult, and I met a woman that I'd
		like to see again socially. How's
		that different from what Wilson did?

				A.J.
		The difference is he didn't have to
		be the president on television.
		You've said it a million times:
		If there were a television set in every
		living room 60 years ago, this country
		does not elect a man in a wheelchair.

				SHEPHERD
		What are you saying?

				A.J.
		We'll take a hit.

				SHEPHERD
		How big?

				A.J.
		I don't know. Five points. Maybe
		more.

				SHEPHERD
		Five points we're standing here
		talking about?!

				A.J.
		It could be more.

				SHEPHERD
		I drop five points when Wisconsin
		doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl.
		5 in the corner.

				A.J.
		Do you want me to have Kodak put
		together some numbers so we know
		what we're talking about?

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah.
			   (beat)
		No. No. I don't want to check a
		polling sample to see if this is
		okay, like I'm asking permission
		to stay out an hour past curfew.
		This isn't the business of the
		American people.

				A.J.
		Mr. President, the American people
		have a funny way of deciding on
		their own what is and what is not
		their business.

				SHEPHERD
		I like her, A.J.
			   (pause)
		Stop being my chief of staff for one
		minute.

				A.J.
			   (beat)
		Give her a call.

				SHEPHERD
			   (calling out)
		Janie!
			   (to A.J.)
		She didn't say anything about me?

				A.J.
		She said you're taller than she
		thought you'd be.

				SHEPHERD
		That's something.

	JANIE enters--

				JANIE
		Yes, sir?

				SHEPHERD
		I need you to track down a phone
		number.

                                                            CUT TO:

	EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET IN GEORGETOWN - NIGHT

	Lined with red-brick, three-story walk-ups.

	INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as
	evidence that SYDNEY's staying with her sister BETH
	temporarily.

	BETH, still in hospital scrubs from a 12-hour shift, opens a
	bottle of wine while SYDNEY, in a bathrobe and wet hair,
	tries to get off the phone.

				SYDNEY
			   (into phone)
		Richard...Richard, it wasn't funny.
		I acted like a college freshman at a
		protest rally.

				BETH
		Tell him the part about walking out
		the wrong door.

				SYDNEY
		Oh God, I forgot about that.
			   (back into phone)
		No, Richard...Richard, I don't want
		to hear your Andrew Shepherd imitation...

				BETH
		I wanna hear it.

				SYDNEY
		I'm hanging up now, Richard...
		Tonight? I was gonna go to bed early
		and wake up when there's a new
		president.

	She hangs up.

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing)
		The President must think I'm a third-
		rate jerk.

				BETH
		If he thinks you're a jerk, I'm sure
		he thinks you're a first-rate jerk.

				SYDNEY
		I'll tell you one thing, boy. I
		regrouped, you gotta gimme that.
		I pulled it together at the end. I
		stood in the middle of the Oval
		Office and I made it very clear that
		from now on, he who doesn't take the
		GDC seriously does so at his peril!

				BETH
		And then you walked out the wrong
		door.

				SYDNEY
		Are you gonna be throwing that back
		at me the rest of my life?

				BETH
		That's my current plan, yes.

	The TELEPHONE RINGS...

				SYDNEY
		That's gonna be Leo Solomon. He said
		he'd call at nine.

	SYDNEY picks up the phone--

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing;
			    into phone)
		Hello?

				SHEPHERD
		Uh, hi, is this Sydney?

	SYDNEY doesn't recognize the voice--

				SYDNEY
			   (into phone)
		Leo?

				PHONE VOICE
		No, this is Andrew Shepherd.

	SYDNEY looks at BETH and rolls her eyes, then explains to
	her--

				SYDNEY
		Andrew Shepherd.
			   (back in the phone)
		You're hilarious, Richard. You're a
		regular riot.

	And we CROSS-CUT between SYDNEY and SHEPHERD.

				SHEPHERD
		Uhh...this isn't Richard, it's Andrew
		Shepherd.

				SYDNEY
		Oh, really. Well, I'm so glad you
		called, because I forgot to tell
		you today what a nice ass you have.
		I'm also impressed that you were able
		to get my phone number, considering
		I don't have a phone. Good night,
		Richard.

	SYDNEY hangs up the phone.


	INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

	as SHEPHERD, undaunted, dials the number again.

				SHEPHERD
			   (under his breath)
		This used to be easier.

	INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	as the PHONE RINGS.

				SYDNEY
		I don't believe this.

				BETH
		You want me to deal with him?

				SYDNEY
		No way. I may choke in front of
		Shepherd, but Richard Reynolds I
		can handle.

	She picks up the phone.

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing)
		Hello?

	And we begin CROSS-CUTTING again between the two.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney?

				SYDNEY
		Are you learning-impaired?!

				SHEPHERD
		Listen, do me a favor. Hang up the
		phone.

				SYDNEY
			   (beat)
		What?

				SHEPHERD
		Hang up the phone. Then dial 456-1414.
		When you get the White House operator,
		give her your name and tell her you

	INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	SYDNEY's still holding the phone and seems a little
	confused...an emotion which is about to be replaced by horror
	as the unbelievable into the reality.

				SYDNEY
			   (to herself)
		This isn't happening to me.

	She dials.

				BETH
		What's going on?

				SYDNEY
			   (to herself)
		It's not possible I did this twice in
		one day.

	The OPERATOR answers.

				OPERATOR
			   (filtered)
		Good evening, the White House.

	SYDNEY swallows.

				OPERATOR
			   (continuing; filtered)
		Hello?

				SYDNEY
			      (quietly)
		My name's Sydney Ellen Wade. I'd
		like to--

				OPERATOR (O.S.)
			   (filtered)
		The President's expecting your call,
		ma'am. I'll put you right through.

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

	He's just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings.
	He picks up the phone--

				SHEPHERD
		Hello.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, I'm sure there's an
		appropriate thing to say at this
		moment. Probably some formal apology
		for the nice-ass remark would be in
		order. I just don't quite know how
		to word it.

				SHEPHERD
		It's my fault. I shouldn't have
		called you at home. Should I call
		you at the office tomorrow?

				SYDNEY
		No, sir, of course not. I mean --
		yes, you can call me anytime you want
		-- this is fine. Right now is fine.
		When I said "of course not," I meat
		that...You know what? The hell with it
		-- I'm moving to another country.

				SHEPHERD
			   (smiling)
		What did you mean when you said you
		don't have a phone.

				SYDNEY
		I just moved to Washington over the
		weekend, and my apartment isn't ready
		yet. This is my sister's apartment.
		Come to think of it, how did you get
		this number?

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		How did I get the number. That's a
		reasonable question. I don't know.
		Probably the FBI.

				SYDNEY
			   (trying to pretend
			    it's just another
			guy on the phone)
		The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want
		to find someone and you're the
		president, that's who you would call.

				SHEPHERD
		You know who else is good at that?

				SYDNEY
		The C.I.A.?

				SHEPHERD
		Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the
		Internal Revenue Service. They have
		computer files that...Well...I should
		stop stalling. As I'm sure you know,
		the French have elected themselves a
		new president, and we're having a formal
		state dinner at the White House, and I
		was wondering -- and you're under no
		obligation at all -- but I thought it
		might be fun... I was wondering if you
		maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh...
		there it is. That's why I was calling.

	There's a long silence on the phone.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Sydney? Sydney, Congress doesn't
		take this long to--

				SYDNEY
		The President has asked me to join
		him in representing our country.
		I'm honored. I'm equal to the task.
		And I won't let you down, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		Sydney, this is just a dinner. We're
		not gonna be doing espionage or
		anything.

				SYDNEY
		No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what
		do I do? I, I mean, where do I go?
		Should I meet you? Will you...

				SHEPHERD
		I'm gonna have a very nice woman
		named Marsha Bridgeport call you.
		She's the White House Social Director,
		and she'll help you with anything you
		want. Now when she calls you and tells
		you her name is Marsha Bridgeport,
		it'll help if you give her the
		benefit of the doubt.

				SYDNEY
		Of course.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll see you Thursday night.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, thank you for asking
		me. Really. This is a first for me.

				SHEPHERD
		Me too.

	They hang up.

	EXT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	INT. THE CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY

	A large conference room at OEOB has been converted for the
	use of a half-dozen STAFFERS as well as ten or twelve
	interns, some of them high school age. A sign on a
	corkboard reads, "17 Votes in 69 Days."

	The two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so
	that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following
	numbers in descending order.

	There is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the
	House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns:
	FOR, LEANING TOWARDS, UNDECIDED, LEANING AGAINST, and AGAINST.

				KODAK
		Who's on Indiana?
			   (raising his voice)
		Excuse me. New people, I can't
		remember your names. Raise your
		hand if you're on Indiana.

	Two INTERNS raise their hands--

				KODAK
			   (continuing)
		Put your hands down -- you're on
		Illinois.

	LEWIS comes in.

				LEWIS
		We've got Jarrett.

				KODAK
		What?

				LEWIS
		George Jarrett. He's ours. Solid
		"yes."

				KODAK
		I don't believe it.
			   (to an INTERN)
		You. New guy. "Jarrett, Democrat,
		Minnesota." Slide his name on over
		to "for."
			   (to Lewis)
		We just had his name laminated under
		"Undecided." How'd you get the fence
		pole out of his butt?

				LEWIS
		I wish I could take credit. He just
		said, "Lewis, I support the President
		a hundred percent ." Not the bill,
		the President.

				LEWIS
		We're gonna win this in a walk. It's
		like a kissing booth at a carnival.
		Give us a vote, get a photo-op with
		number 63.

	LEWIS reaches to the tote board and pulls the "17" off,
	revealing "16."

				LEWIS
		We should have gone after the
		handguns.

				KODAK
		We gotta do one thing at a time.

				LEWIS
		We don't have time to do one thing at
		a time.

	INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

	A GDC conference room that SYDNEY, her assistant, DAVID, and
	two INTERNS have made into their 72-day headquarters. A
	similar tote board reads "23 Votes in 69 Days."

	The two interns are marking spreadsheets. DAVID is on one
	phone, SYDNEY is on another.

				DAVID
			   (into phone)
		Carol, it's David in Sydney Wade's
		office. I want to confirm her lunch
		with the Congressman.

				SYDNEY
			   (into phone)
		We could do with a little party
		leadership, Mike. Is the Majority
		Whip takin' a break? Congress is in
		session, right, I'm not wrong about
		that?

	LISA, another intern, is hanging up a phone in the background
	and crossing to the corkboard.

				LISA
		I just got off with Luther Simons.
		Brock's on board.

				SYDNEY
		Terrific!

	She rips the "23" off, making it "22." SYDNEY reaches for
	her coffee and knocks over a cup of pencils. In righting the
	pencils, she knocks over her coffee.

				DAVID
		You're awfully jumpy today. What do
		you have -- a big date tonight?

	With that, a big pile of papers is sent flying off the desk.

	INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

	It's a beautiful night. The White House, lit up and shimmering
	in its golden glow, would appear now to be exactly what the
	poet was looking at when he described The Shining City on a
	Hill.

	Limousines, several of which fly the flag of foreign
	diplomats, pull up one by one, their doors opened by white-
	gloved MARINES.

	White lights from television cameras mix with the fireworks
	of flashbulbs from the print media.


	INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

	The GUESTS -- of whom there are a couple hundred -- in black tie
	and evening gowns, are entering the receiving area.

	All this happening, of course, under the eye of the SECRET
	SERVICE AGENTS, both American and French, who are
	strategically placed throughout.

	The light from a TV camera comes on as a reporter begins a
	quick stand-up interview with ROBERT RUMSON, a handsome man
	in his late forties.

				REPORTER (LLOYD)
			   (to the camera)
		I'm standing here with Senate
		Minority Leader Robert Rumson, just
		one of the many guests arriving at
		what, for a few hours at least, is a
		non-partisan White House. Senator,
		the latest public opinion survey
		shows the President with approval
		ratings that would make him all but
		unbeatable, come next November. Is
		there a Republican who can mount a
		serious challenge, and are you that
		candidate?

				RUMSON
		Lloyd, it's a long time till next
		November. Right now, I'm just
		looking forward to a pleasant evening.

	Lucy is standing behind her father, tying his bow tie.

				SHEPHERD
		That's a little tight, Luce.

				LUCY
		It's supposed to be tight. It's
		supposed to make you look regal.

				SHEPHERD
		Is it supposed to cut off the blood
		flow to my face?

				LUCY
		All done.

	He looks in the mirror.

				SHEPHERD
		Not bad. Where did you learn how to
		do this?

				LUCY
		Social studies.

				SHEPHERD
		Very funny.
			       (smiles)
		Really, where did you learn?

				LUCY
		I don't know...I just guess...

				SHEPHERD
		Sweetie, did Mom teach you how to do
		this?

				LUCY
		Yeah.

				SHEPHERD
			       (pause)
		Lucy, is this okay with you? My
		having dinner with a woman?

				LUCY
		It's totally okay.

				SHEPHERD
		Are you sure? Because if you want to
		talk about it...

				LUCY
		Dad, it's cool. Go for it.

				SHEPHERD
		You know, I'm a little nervous.

				LUCY
		You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

				SHEPHERD
		Be myself.

				LUCY
		And compliment her shoes.

				SHEPHERD
		Her shoes?

				LUCY
		Girls like that.

	Dressed in formal, but not festive, clothes and holding, as
	always, her notepad, JANIE waits by the door.

	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT sits alone behind a small desk.

	The door opens and SYDNEY walks in. She's, needless to say,
	stunning.

				JANIE
		Miss Wade? The President wants you
		to join him upstairs in the
		residence. May I show you the way?

	This formal reception area is filled with special GUESTS. As

				A.J.
		Sydney, come on in. You look
		beautiful.

				SYDNEY
		Thank you. I have no idea what I'm
		doing here.

				A.J.
		I promise you there's no hidden
		agenda.

	SHEPHERD approaches SYDNEY.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney. Andrew Shepherd. We spoke on
		the phone.

				SYDNEY
		Yes, sir. I remember.

	ESTHER, MACINERNERY, A.J.'S wife, joins them.

				A.J.
		You know my wife, Esther.

				SYDNEY
		Sure. It's nice to see you again.

				ESTHER
			   (affectionately)
		Sydney, the President told me about
		how you two met. I think it's
		priceless.

				SYDNEY
		I don't know what happened. One
		minute I was calling him a mockery of
		an environmental leader. The next
		minute I had a date.

				ESTHER
		Men like being insulted by women.
		It makes them feel loved. Don't ask
		me why.

				A.J.
		Sydney, when you meet the French
		President, don't make him feel too
		loved, all right? We just signed a
		new trade agreement.

				SYDNEY
		Got it.

	The French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to D'Astier)
		Mr. President, would allow me to
		introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the
		Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney,
		this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier
		and his wife Monique Danielle
		D'Astier of France.

				SYDNEY
		An honor to meet you both.

				JANIE
		Mr. President, I'm sorry to
		interrupt. The receiving line is in
		place.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, it sounds like our table's
		ready.

	SHEPHERD's guests make their way out of the residence,
	leaving SHEPHERD with SYDNEY and the FRENCH PRESIDENT and
	MDME. D'ASTIER.

	INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads
	to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters
	the East Room.

	The GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so
	that the two of them can have some privacy.

				SHEPHERD
		Once we hit the bottom of the
		stairs, I gotta do a thing.
		You'll be escorted...

				SYDNEY
		They took me through it.

	After a slight pause--

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing)
		Do you do this often, sir?

				SHEPHERD
			   (beat)
		This is, actually, only our second
		State Dinner. The first was for the
		Emperor of Japan, who died shortly
		after that, so we stopped having them
		for a while, just in case.

				SYDNEY
		I meant do you go out on...do you--
		often--do you--

				SHEPHERD
		Do I date a lot?

				SYDNEY
		Well, yeah.

				SHEPHERD
		No. How 'bout you?

				SYDNEY
		Me? Lately, I seem to be going out
		on a lot of first dates.

				SHEPHERD
		Then you're experienced at this.

				SYDNEY
		Oh yeah, you can ask me anything.

				SHEPHERD
		How are we doing so far?

				SYDNEY
		It's hard to say at this point. So
		far it's just your typical first date
		stuff.

	And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East
	Room--

	--The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four
	ruffles and flourishes.

				SHEPHERD
		Damn. And I wanted to find a way to
		be different from the other guys.

	A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces--

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Ladies and gentlemen, the President
		of the United States.

	And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision --

				SHEPHERD
		By the way, nice shoes.

	--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion
	Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF.

	The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud.

	The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot
	where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the
	applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite
	swept up.

	STEWARDS are clearing away the main course and refilling wine

	In addition to the two main couples, and ESTHER MacINERNEY
	and TWO OTHER COUPLES are seated at the President's table.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, the President and Mrs.
		D'Astier look bored. They're not
		talking to anybody.

				SHEPHERD
		They're hammered. Esther, do you speak
		French?

				ESTHER
		Latin.

				SHEPHERD
		I thought you spoke French.

				ESTHER
		No, Latin.

				SHEPHERD
		Great, next time Julius Caesar comes
		to town, you're our gal. Sydney, I
		don't suppose that you speak any--

				SYDNEY
		         (taking over--
		          to D'Astier)
		Monsieur le President, nous sommes
		tous habilles, nous avons ce
		merveilleux orchestre, une piece
		magnifique...comment se fait-il que
		les invites ne dansent pas?

				SHEPHERD
			   (proudly to A.J. and
			    Esther)
		That's my date.

				D'ASTIER
		Je ne connais pas la tradition en
		Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les
		invites de Louis XVI et Marie
		Antoinette avaient ose danser devant
		le roi et la reine, ils auraient
		perdu la tete.

				SYDNEY
		Really?

				MADAME D'ASTIER
		Absolument.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney, you didn't dissolve the NATO
		treaty, did you?

				SYDNEY
		I just said that we're sitting in this
		beautiful room, listening to the music
		of this wonderful orchestra, and I
		wondered why nobody was dancing.

				D'ASTIER
		And I informed Ms. Wade that in my
		country, a guest at the palace of
		Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would
		soon find their head in a guillotine
		if they made the impertinent gesture
		of dancing without so much as a
		by-your-leave from the King and the Queen.

				A.J.
		I'll bet no one accused Louis of
		being soft on crime.

				SYDNEY
		There's a lesson there, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		More beheadings at the White House?

				A.J.
		Bob Rumson would embrace it.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm sure he would, but I have a
		better idea.

	SHEPHERD stands, holds out his hand to SYDNEY.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Would you like to dance?

				SYDNEY
		Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, yes, sir,
		I'd love to.

	SHEPHERD and SYDNEY move to the dance floor, accompanied by
	the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the GUESTS.

	The dance band begins, and SYDNEY and SHEPHERD dance...

	...beautifully.

	SHEPHERD AND SYDNEY DANCING

				SYDNEY
		I don't know how you do it.

				SHEPHERD
		Arthur Murray. Six lessons.

				SYDNEY
		That's not what I mean. Two hundred
		pairs of eyes are focused on you
		right now, with two questions:
		"Who's this girl, and why's our
		president dancing with her?"

				SHEPHERD
		First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes
		aren't focused on me. They're
		focused on you. And the answers are
		"Sydney Ellen Wade" and "Because she
		said 'yes.'"

		Janie, what's the state flower of

		Mrs. Chapil. State flower of

				MRS. CHAPIL
		The dogwood.

		The dogwood, sir.

				SHEPHERD

		Thank you.
			   (into phone)
		It's the dogwood.
			   (pause)
		What? Hold on please.
			   (to JANIE, through
			    intercom)
		Janie, the dogwood is a tree, not a
		flower.

				SHEPHERD

		Really? No dogwoods? How 'bout

		Janie, I'm the President senior

	INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY

	SYDNEY enters.

				SYDNEY
		Leo, you wanted to see me?

				LEO
		So there I was, thinking maybe I
		should give Sydney a call. She's
		new in town, doesn't know many
		people...

	LEO produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo
	of SHEPHERD and SYDNEY dancing.

				SYDNEY
		Leo--

				LEO
		Then I picked up the Times--

				SYDNEY
		It was crazy. He called me at home.

				LEO
		What's going on?

				SYDNEY
		Nothing. It was innocent. His
		cousin got the flu at the last
		minute.

				LEO
		Did you sleep with him?

				SYDNEY
		What?

				LEO
		Did you sleep--

				SYDNEY
		That's none of your business, Leo.

				LEO
		Yeah, it is, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		You wanna tell me how my personal
		life in any way--

				LEO
		Because when it's the President, it's
		not personal. Sydney, I hired your
		reputation. I hired a pit bull, not
		a prom queen.

				SYDNEY
		That's unfair.

				LEO
		It's incredibly unfair. But you've
		spent a lot of time over the year
		telling me the trouble with the
		environmental lobby is that we don't
		understand the fundamental truth that
		politics is perception. This is a
		bad time to develop ignorance.

				SYDNEY
		You're making way too much of this.

				LEO
		Am I? This is your time, Sydney.
		You're sitting at the grown-ups'
		table. You have a chance to get
		everything you want -- run a national
		campaign, be a major player inside
		the party. But this relationship had
		better go all the way, because with
		the leader of the free world there is
		no halfway. Politics is perception,
		and if thing don't work out, the
		amount of time it'll take you to go
		from being a hired gun to a cocktail
		party joke can be clocked with an egg
		timer.

	There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in
	with a strange-looking package.

				SYDNEY
		Leo, there is no relationship. It
		was one night. It's done.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered
		by White House messenger. It's
		marked "Perishable."

				LEO
		The White House has sent me something
		perishable?

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		It's for Ms. Wade.

				LEO
		Here we go...

	SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package.

				SYDNEY
		Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a
		formality.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
			   (exited)
		It's from him.

				LEO
		Of course it's from him.

				SYDNEY
		So he had some staff flunky send
		me a fruit basket.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		He wrote the note himself.

				SYDNEY
		I'm sure he didn't take the time to--

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		The messenger said he was waiting in
		the Oval Office for ten minutes while
		the President wrote the card.

				SYDNEY
		Okay, listen, so he--
			   (to LEO'S SECRETARY)
		--it took him ten minutes to write a
		card?!

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		Apparently he went through several
		drafts.

	SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is.

				LEO
		What is it...what is it?

				SYDNEY
		A ham.

				LEO
			   (beat)
		A ham?

				SYDNEY
		He sent me a Virginia ham.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the
		President's girlfriend.

	SYDNEY's smile fades away...she looks at LEO.

				LEO
		There's never an egg timer around
		when you need one.

	SHEPHERD is conferring with LEWIS and ROBIN.

				ROBIN
		Sir, they're gonna be pressing today
		about whether the White House is
		prepared to soften the assault
		weapons section of the crime bill.

				LEWIS
		There is no need to entertain that
		at this point.

				ROBIN
		How do you want me to handle the
		Sydney issue?

				SHEPHERD
		The Sydney issue?

				LEWIS
		We should have a consensus on how the
		White House is going to handle it.

				SHEPHERD
		I sure hope the Sydney issue refers
		in some way to a problem we're having
		with Australia, because if it's
		anything else...

	JANIE pokes her head in.

				JANIE
		Mr. President, Ms. Wade is here to
		see you.

				SHEPHERD
		Tell her she can come right in. I'm
		finished here.

				JANIE
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			 (to LEWIS and ROBIN)
		There is no Sydney issue.

	SYDNEY enters, crossing paths with LEWIS and ROBIN. They
	exchange pleasantries.

				SYDNEY
			   (to SHEPHERD)
		Thanks for seeing me on such short
		notice.

				SHEPHERD
		No problem. Did you get the ham?

				SYDNEY
		I got the ham, yes. Thank you very
		much.

				SHEPHERD
		I wanted to send you flowers, but
		there seem to be some kinks in the
		system. I'm really glad you stopped
		by. I had such a good time last
		night.

				SYDNEY
		So did I. It's just that...

	JANIE enters.

				JANIE
		They're 45 seconds away, sir.

	During the following, JANIE will go to the desk, pick up two
	briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up
	his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm delivering a luncheon speech at
		the Governor's Conference this
		morning. I'm sorry to--

				SYDNEY
		No, no, that's fine. I just stopped
		by to...

				SHEPHERD
		Are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

				SYDNEY
		Dinner?

				SHEPHERD
		Casual. In the Residence. Without
		the United Nations. My daughter'll
		be with us, so it may seem like the
		United--

				SYDNEY
		I'd love to meet Lucy, but...

	An AIDE has slipped in and hands SHEPHERD a note.

				SHEPHERD
			   (reading to himself
			   as he talks SYDNEY)
		She's gonna like you.
			   (calling to the AIDE)
		Excuse me -- Jeff!

				SYDNEY
		Actually, I have some concerns that--

	The AIDE (JEFF) steps back in--

				JEFF
		Yes, sir.

				SHEPHERD
			   (reading the note)
		I can't do this.

				JEFF
		Which? Robbins or Stackhouse?

				SHEPHERD
		Either one. I have to be in and out.

				JEFF
		Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just
		needed 10 minutes. I think he wants
		to talk about the assault weapons.

				SHEPHERD
		Stackhouse wants to talk about
		grazing rights. Trust me.

				JEFF
		Got it.

	And he's gone.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to Sydney)
		Sorry. You have concerns.

				SYDNEY
		Yes. Not many. A few. One. I have
		one concern.

				SHEPHERD
		Does it having anything to do with
		one of us being the President?

				SYDNEY
		You like to make jokes about this,
		but--

				SHEPHERD
		I am not mocking you, honest. I'm
		just a guy asking a girl over for a
		meal.

	And, as if from out of nowhere, a LOUD CLAAAMMERING, like the
	sound of a jackhammer against cement, comes from somewhere
	outside -- growing louder and closer --

				SYDNEY
		What's that?

				SHEPHERD
		My ride's here.

	And, sure enough, coming into view outside the windows of the
	Oval Office, is MARINE-1, the President's helicopter. JANIE
	comes back in and helps him on with his coat and scarf.

				SYDNEY
		Leo Solomon has serious concerns
		about my exploring a social, you
		know, scenario, with the President
		of the United States.

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah, well, when you put it that
		way, it doesn't sound that great
		to me either.

				SYDNEY
		It's just not--

				SHEPHERD
		Have dinner with Lucy and me. It's
		meat loaf night -- how presidential
		can it be?

	As SHEPHERD rushes out...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Seven-thirty.

	SYDNEY now stands alone in the OVAL OFFICE, trying to figure
	out what just happened.

			(standing up, smiling)
		Sydney.

		Lucy Shepherd.

				SYDNEY
		Nice to meet you.

				LUCY
		My dad told me to tell you he's on
		the phone with his dentist and that
		I should behave myself and entertain
		you till he gets here.

				SYDNEY
		Your father's on the phone with his
		dentist?

				LUCY
		No. He told me to tell you he's on
		the phone with his dentist. He wants
		you to think he's a regular guy.

				SYDNEY
		Who is he on the phone with?

				LUCY
		The Prime Minister of Israel.

				SYDNEY
		They're probably not discussing his
		teeth.

				LUCY
		No. They're talking about that

				SYDNEY
		C-STAD?

				LUCY
		Yeah.

				SYDNEY
		Capricorn Surface To Air Defense.

				LUCY
		Right.

	SHEPHERD enters.

				SHEPHERD
		Let meat loaf night begin.

				SYDNEY
		Everything all right with your teeth?

				SHEPHERD
		My teeth?

				SYDNEY
		The dentist.

				SHEPHERD
		Oh, right. I've got a cavity in my
		upper bicuspid region.

				SYDNEY
		You've got a short-range weapons
		system outside Tel Aviv.

				RUMSON
			   (continuing)
		Voters aren't interested in how to
		achieve economic growth, and they
		don't want to hear our plans to
		strengthen foreign policy.

				STAFFER #1
		So it comes down to character.

				STAFFER #2
		The press like him, Senator. The
		networks, the newspapers, they're--

				RUMSON
		Reporters like him. Networks and
		newspapers like ratings and circulation.
		For all the bitching we do about liberal
		bias in the press when it comes down to
		a character debate...

				STAFFER #3
		The press is an unwitting accomplice.

				CARL
		Bob, the character debate didn't work
		out for us.

				RUMSON
		Because it couldn't. Our polling
		told us that attacking his character
		less than a year after he'd lost his
		wife was gonna be a turn-off and was
		gonna make people feel sorry for him.
		We couldn't run the campaign we wanted
		because the opponent was a widower.

				CARL
		He's still a widower. Time's passed,
		but--

				RUMSON
			   (to the rest)
		You'll have to forgive my friend.
		He's been on a hunting trip and cut
		off from the world.

				CARL
		What's going on?

	And four STAFFERS grab whatever newspaper is closest to their
	hand and toss them to CARL.

				RUMSON
		The President's got a girlfriend.

		She's not having any fun, though.

				LUCY
		Dad--

				SYDNEY
		You're not having fun?

				LUCY
			   (to herself)
		This is a nightmare. This is a

				SHEPHERD
		They're doing a mock Congress. Each

	LUCY gets up from the table and kisses her father.

				LUCY
		G'night, Dad.

				SHEPHERD
		G'night, sweetheart.

		It was nice meeting you, Mrs.--

		Thank you. It was nice meeting

				SHEPHERD
		Sleep well, honey. I love you.

		Would you like the 25-cent tour?

	INT. THE EAST WING - NIGHT

	This is the "museum" area of the White House, the part you
	see when you take the official tour. Only a few lights are
	lit, and while the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS give SHEPHERD plenty
	of breathing room when he's in the residence, we'll still
	catch a glimpse of one of them rounding a corner in the
	distance or checking a doorway ahead.

				SYDNEY
		I thought C-STAD wasn't gonna be
		operational until January.

				SHEPHERD
		It was ready ahead of schedule.
		We've just been waiting for the
		personnel.

				SYDNEY
		The Israelis?

				SHEPHERD
		No, our guys. We've sent a team of
		Army instructors to train the
		Israelis.

	SYDNEY and SHEPHERD enter the:


	INT. THE CHINA ROOM - NIGHT

	Named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full
	place settings of the official White House china and
	silverware from every administration since Jackson.

				SHEPHERD:
			   (remembering)
		I think this is the dish room.

				SYDNEY
		It's not the dish--

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah, it is. It's the room with all
		the dishes.

				SYDNEY
		It's the China Room.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm more of a West Wing President.
		If you're curious about the mansion,
		there's probably a book you can get--

				SYDNEY
		There're about seven-thousand books.
		I'll get one for you.

	SYDNEY's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the
	display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows,
	she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of
	incredibly flattering moonlight.

	The vision isn't lost on SHEPHERD. They stare at each other
	for a moment.

				SHEPHERD
		Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President -- have you ever noticed
		how similar the Van Buren flatware is
		to the Buchanan flatware?

				SHEPHERD
		Do you think there will ever come a
		time when you can stand in a room
		with me and not think of me as the
		President?

				SYDNEY
		This isn't a state of mind. You are
		the President. And when I'm in a
		room with you, oval or any other
		shape, I'm always gonna be a
		lobbyist, and you'll always be the
		President.

				SHEPHERD
		I got news for you, Sydney. As a
		lobbyist, you would never be alone in
		a room with the President.

	This last statement is not lost on SYDNEY.

	He moves toward her until they are both bathed in the
	moonlight. He puts his arms around her.

				SYDNEY
		You think this is a good idea?

				SHEPHERD
		Probably not.

	They lean in to kiss each other. They barely make contact
	when...

				AGENT #3 (O.S.)
		Mr. President...

	An AGENT is standing in the doorway -- SHEPHERD and SYDNEY
	break apart.

				AGENT #3
		We have a secure call from the sit-
		room.

	SHEPHERD knows what that means.

				SHEPHERD
		Excuse me.

	He moves out the door and into the corridor.

	SYDNEY, knowing something's wrong, instinctively moves to
	follow him and be with him, but the AGENT hasn't moved from
	the doorway, so--

				AGENT #3
		Sorry, ma'am.

				SYDNEY
			   (beat)
		No...of course.

	SHEPHERD comes back in.

				SHEPHERD
		Listen--

				SYDNEY
		Is anything wrong?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm sorry, we're going to have to cut
		our evening short. The Libyans have
		just bombed C-STAD. I'll try to call
		you tomorrow.
			   (to the AGENT)
		Can you show Ms. Wade out.

	SHEPHERD exits.

	SYDNEY, alone for a second in the dish room, is finally
	approached by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT, who starts to escort
	her out.

				CHAIRMAN (V.O.)
		The response scenario's in place...

	SHEPHERD, A.J., the SECRETARY OF STATE, the SECRETARY OF

	trained for.

				CHAIRMAN
			   (continuing)
		...The F-18's are fired up on the
		Kimitz and the Kitty Hawk. They're
		just waiting for your attack order,
		Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		And we're gonna hit Libyan
		Intelligence Headquarters?

				MAN
		The N.S.A. confirmed they're the ones
		who planned the bombing.


				A.J.
		What's the estimate?

				GENERAL
		We'll level the building.

				SHEPHERD
		Libyan I.H.Q's in the middle of
		downtown Tripoli -- are we gonna hit
		anything else?

				GENERAL
		Only if we miss.

				SHEPHERD
		Are we gonna miss?

				GENERAL
		No, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		How many people work in that building?

				CHAIRMAN
		We've been all through--

				SHEPHERD
		How many people work in the damn
		building?

				DEPUTY
		I've got those number here. There
		are three shifts, so it--

				SHEPHERD
		The fewest. What shift puts the
		fewest people in the building? The
		night shift, right?

				DEPUTY
		By far. Mostly custodial staff and
		a few--

				SHEPHERD
		What time does the night crew go on?

				DEPUTY
		They're on now, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		A.J.?

				A.J.
		It's immediate, it's decisive, it's
		low risk, and it's a proportional
		response.

				SHEPHERD
		Someday somebody's going to have to
		explain to me the virtue of a
		proportional response.

	There's a SILENCE. SHEPHERD gets up and starts to head out
	the door.

				CHAIRMAN
		Mr. President?

				SHEPHERD

				A.J.
		Robin, as soon as our planes have
		cleared Libyan airspace, you can call

		have the full B.D.A.--

				LEWIS
		General Rork says around O-Eight
		Hundred.

				ROBIN
		Sir, what do you think about a
		national address?

				SHEPHERD
		The last thing I want to do is put
		the Lybians center stage.

				KODAK
		I think it's a great idea, sir. You
		know Rumson's gonna be talking about
		your lack of military service.

				SHEPHERD
		This isn't about Rumson. What I did
		tonight was not about political gain.

				KODAK
		But it can be, sir. What you did
		tonight was very presidential.

				SHEPHERD
		Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now
		there's a janitor working the night
		shift at the Libyan Intelligence
		Headquarters. He's going about his
		job 'cause he has no idea that in
		about an hour he's gonna die in a
		massive explosion. He's just going
		about his job 'cause he has no idea
		that an hour ago I gave an order to
		have him killed. You just saw me do
		the least presidential thing I do.

				KODAK
		yes, sir.

				SALLY
		Is there anything at all about the
		C-STAD weapons system that could have
		been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence
		as offensive rather than defensive?

				SHEPHERD
		No. We did everything but show them

				LESLIE
		Sir, there's an unconfirmed report
		that you were with Sydney Wade when
		you learned of the attack. Can you
		comment?

				A.J.
			   (sotto to ROBIN)
		Get him off.

				SHEPHERD
		Yes, we'd just finished dinner.

				ROBIN
		Last question.

				MARK
		Sir, would you care to comment on
		the status of your relationship?

				SHEPHERD
		We don't have a relationship. We
		just had dinner.

				CAROL
		Can you tell us if she spent the
		night at the White House or did--

				SHEPHERD
		Folks, a lot of people got killed
		last night. Let's try to keep our
		eyes on the ball, okay?

	SHEPHERD is herded out of the briefing room amidst a chorus
	of "Mr. President" 's.

	INT. THE WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

	SHEPHERD walks away from the briefing room with ROBIN. JANIE
	joins him.

				ROBIN
		That was my fault, sir. We should
		have prepped you for that.

				SHEPHERD
		There's nothing that needs prepping.
		A.J., let's meet with the leadership
		after we meet with the Security
		Council.

				ROBIN
		"Newsweek" is begging for ten minutes
		today. Any ten minutes you got.

				SHEPHERD
		Nobody gets ten minutes today.

	INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

	SHEPHERD sits at his desk, is on the phone. A TELEVISION
	NEWSCAST is doing a report on Congressional reaction to the
	events of the day. ROB RUMSON is talking.

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis, tell the speaker to wait.
		I want to talk to him. No, I'll be
		right down.

				RUMSON
		...Last night, the price of his
		liberal programs was raised to
		include the blood of 22 American
		soldiers.

	He hangs up. On the TV, we see a quick sound bite from RUMSON.

				RUMSON
		...Mr. Shepherd's read a lot of
		books, but you didn't need a Harvard
		degree to see this comin' a mile down
		the road.

				SHEPHERD
		I went to Stanford, you blowhole.

				RUMSON
		The fat that our Commander-in-Chief
		has not served one day in uniform--

	SHEPHERD clicks off the TV and then stares at

	A SLIP OF PAPER THAT SAYS "SYDNEY"

		This box just says "Miscellaneous."
		Is this bedroom miscellaneous or

	INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	SYDNEY and BETH have been getting SYDNEY moved in. BETH is
	holding a carton.

				BETH
		Sydney?

				SYDNEY
		Why did I have to kiss him?

				BETH
		You kissed him?

				SYDNEY
		Yeah.

				BETH
		You didn't' tell me that.

				SYDNEY
		I kissed him.

				BETH
		Where?

				SYDNEY
		On the mouth.

				BETH
			   (exasperated)
		Where in the White House?!

				SYDNEY
		In the dish room.

				BETH
		The dish room?

				SYDNEY
		The China Room.

				BETH
		Then what happened?

				SYDNEY
		He had to go and attack Libya.

				BETH
		It's always something.

				SYDNEY
		I've gotta nip this in the bud. This
		has catastrophe written all over it.

				BETH
		In what language?! Sydney, this man
		is the leader of the free world.
		He's brilliant, he's funny, he's
		handsome, and he's an above-average
		dancer. Isn't it possible our
		standards are just a tad high?

	The PHONE RINGS--

	SYDNEY freezes.

	The PHONE RINGS again.

				BETH
			   (continuing)
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY
		It's him.

				BETH
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY
		He's gonna ask me to come over
		there.

				BETH
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY
		I don't want to go over there.

				BETH
		Answer the phone.

				SYDNEY

	All right. But I'm gonna end it
		on the phone. I'm not gonna go
		over there.

	SHEPHERD opens his door, revealing SYDNEY. Agent COOPER is
	letting her in.

				SYDNEY
		I just came over here to tell you
		why I can't see you anymore.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to COOPER)
		Thanks, Coop.

	SHEPHERD closes the door.

				SYDNEY
		Look, I know you've had a tough
		day.

				SHEPHERD
		Not as tough as some. You want a
		drink? Lemme take your coat.

	But SYDNEY doesn't take her coat off.

				SYDNEY
		Mr. President, this isn't gonna work.

				SHEPHERD
		Sure it will. You button the top
		button, and it doesn't fall off
		the hanger.


				SYDNEY
		That's not what I...

				SHEPHERD
		I didn't think so. Listen...

				SYDNEY
		I've really enjoyed the time we've
		spent together, but this has
		catastrophe written all over it.
		Please, Mr. President, don't pursue
		me outside the political arena.

				SHEPHERD
		Well, I have no intention of pursuing
		you inside the political arena, so
		that leaves everything out, and
		that's unacceptable to me.

				SYDNEY
		If I were on your staff, I would tell
		you that the absolute worst thing you
		can do coming into an election year
		is to open yourself up to character
		attacks, and the fastest way to do
		that is to prance around like the
		playboy of the Western world.

				SHEPHERD
		Let's clear up a couple of things.
		Number 1: I seldom prance.
		Number 2: I have no intention of
		engaging in a character debate, and
		Number 3: You're not on my staff.

				SYDNEY
		Yes, of course, but if you'll follow
		the immutable--

				SHEPHERD
		Why is that, by the way?

				SYDNEY
		Why's that?

				SHEPHERD
		Why aren't you on my staff?

				SYDNEY
		You can't afford me.

				SHEPHERD
		How much do you make?

				SYDNEY
		More than you do, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		The name's Andy. How much money do
		you make?

				SYDNEY
		What the hell does it matter how
		much money I--

				SHEPHERD
		You would raise your voice to the
		President?

				SYDNEY
		I'm only thinking about the health
		of your Presidency. You think this
		morning's press conference was the
		end of it? Bob Rumson's gotta be
		drooling over this.

				SHEPHERD
		Are you attracted to me?

				SYDNEY
		I beg your pardon?

				SHEPHERD
		I asked if--

				SYDNEY
			    (of course she is)
		That's not the issue--

				SHEPHERD
		Well, I tell you what. Let's make
		it the issue. Let's try something
		new, 'cause I know that most couples,
		when they're first getting together,
		are inclined to slam on the brakes
		because they're concerned about Bob
		Rumson's drool.

				SYDNEY
		You're not most people.

				SHEPHERD
		You know what your problem is?

				SYDNEY
		What's my problem?

				SHEPHERD
		Sex and nervousness.

				SYDNEY
		Sex and nervousness is my problem.

				SHEPHERD
		Yes. Last night when we were
		looking at the different place
		settings in the dish room, I
		realized that those place settings
		were provided by the First Ladies.
		And I'll bet none of those First
		Ladies were nervous about having
		sex with their President husbands.
		And you know why?

				SYDNEY
		No, but I'm sure you'll explain it
		to me.

				SHEPHERD
		I will. Because they weren't
		presidents when they met them. Not
		the case here.

				SYDNEY
		Ahhhhhh.

				SHEPHERD
		You see what I'm getting at?

				SYDNEY
		Yes. May I use your bathroom for a
		moment?

				SHEPHERD
		Sure. It's right through there.

				SYDNEY
		I want to freshen up.

				SHEPHERD
		As you pass through, you'll see a
		large closet on your left. And if
		you feel comfortable, hang up your
		coat, and when you come back I'll
		have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on
		the couch, and I will explain to
		you my plan.

				SYDNEY
		You have a plan? Don't make me
		wait. You're on a roll.

	SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area.
	SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a
	couple of drinks.

				SHEPHERD
			   (speaking up)
		Okay. You're attracted to me, but
		the idea of physical intimacy is
		uncomfortable because you only know
		me as the President. It's not always
		gonna be that way, and the reason I
		know that is because there was a
		moment last night when you were with
		me and not the President, and I know
		what a big step that was for you.
		So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's
		my plan: We're gonna slow down.
		When you're comfortable, that's
		when it'll happen.

	SYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of
	SHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward
	him.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Perhaps I didn't properly explain
		the fundamentals of the "Slow Down"
		plan.

				SYDNEY
		You explained it great.

	She moves closer to him.

				SHEPHERD
			   (pause)
		Are you nervous?

				SYDNEY
		No.

				SHEPHERD
		Good. My nervousness exists on
		several levels. Number 1 -- and
		this is in no particular order --
		I haven't done this in a pretty
		long time. Number 2: Any expectations
		you might have, due to the fact that
		I'm, you know...

				SYDNEY
		The most powerful man in the world?

				SHEPHERD
		Exactly, thank you. Just so you
		remember that's a political
		distinction that comes with the
		office. I mean, if Eisenhower were
		here instead of me he'd be dead by
		now. And number three...

				SYDNEY
			   (gently)
		Andy...

	They're both standing, facing each other...

	They gently kiss. They just stay with it until it becomes
	easier and better and exactly what they want.

				RUMSON (V.O.)
		Does New Hampshire want traditional
		American values back in the White
		House?

				CROWD
		Yes!!

	A crowd of 300 or so is being whipped into a frenzy.
	Rumson's bringing it home under a campaign banner
	proclaiming: THE PRIDE IS BACK -- BOB RUMSON.

				RUMSON
		Does New Hampshire want the pride back?

	The CROWD goes nuts upon hearing Rumson's signature phrase--

				CROWD
		Yeah!!!!!!!

				RUMSON
		My name is Bob Rumson. And I'm
		running for President.

	And as the CROWD loses its mind, we

	It is very early, and SHEPHERD is still asleep. As we PULL
	BACK, WE REVEAL that he is alone in his bed. The PHONE RINGS.

	SHEPHERD picks it up--

				SHEPHERD
			   (into phone)
		Yeah...put him through.
			   (listens)
		Lewis, it is 5:00 a.m. You gotta
		get yourself a life, man.
			   (listens)
		Yeah...all right.

	He hangs up the phone and looks around the room, only to
	notice SYDNEY is tiptoeing around in the dim light, trying
	to quietly dress herself and gather up her things. SHEPHERD
	watches this odd spectacle for a moment before he says--

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Sydney?

	SYDNEY turns around.

				SYDNEY
		Hi.

				SHEPHERD
		What are you doing?

				SYDNEY
		I wanted to leave the building before
		the press corps got here.

				SHEPHERD
		I have those same thoughts every day
		of my life. Say, you know Lewis
		Rothschild, don't you? Well, he's...

				SYDNEY
		Sure. Boy, Lewis'd go nuts if he
		knew I'd spent the night.

	There's a KNOCK on the door.

				SHEPHERD
		...on his way up.

				SYDNEY
		What?

				SHEPHERD
		Come on in, Lewis.

	LEWIS comes in--

				LEWIS
		'Morning, Mr. President. Hi, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President,
		thank you for taking the time to go
		over those fossil fuel numbers. I'll
		just get my coat, and be on my way.

	SHEPHERD laughs at SYDNEY's purposely lame try--

				SHEPHERD
			   (to LEWIS)
		What's the situation?

				LEWIS
		They're camped out at every exit.

				SYDNEY
		Who? Who's camped out?

				LEWIS
		The press.

				SYDNEY
		The press is camped out?

				LEWIS
		You shoulda taken a cab, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		They know my car?!

	ROBIN enters.

				ROBIN
		Good morning, Mr. President. Hi,
		Sydney. I came over as soon as Lewis
		called.

				SHEPHERD
		Thank God.

				ROBIN
		I think the important thing is not
		to make it look like we're panicking.

				SHEPHERD
		See, and I think the important thing
		is actually not to be panicking.

	A.J. KNOCKS on the open door and walks in.

				A.J.
		Good morning, Mr. President. Good
		morning, Ms. Wade. I see everyone's
		getting an early start today.

				LEWIS
		How do we exit Sydney from the
		building and what do we say to the
		press at that point?

				ROBIN
		We need a diversion.

				SYDNEY
		A diversion.

				ROBIN
		You understand that by diversion
		I'm not saying we set the White
		House on fire.

				SHEPHERD
		No, please, let's do.

				LEWIS
		Can I state very clearly that I
		can't be party to anything illegal.

				A.J.
		Good for you, Lewis.

				LEWIS
		Say what you want, but it's always
		the guy in my job that ends up doing
		eighteen months in Danbury Minimum
		Security Prison.

				SHEPHERD
		Rest easy, Lewis. We're not creating
		a diversion.

				ROBIN
		No diversion.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to SYDNEY)
		We'll have somebody take you home.

				A.J.
		Esther's over in my office. She's
		got the station wagon outside.

	SHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man planned
	ahead.

				LEWIS
		Okay. Good. Now, the press
		statement.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to SYDNEY)
		Sydney, when you leave here, you're
		gonna run into reporters and
		photographers. Your picture's gonna
		be taken every day, and you're gonna
		be asked questions every day. Answer
		them, don't answer them -- it's
		entirely up to you. The White House
		has no official position except to
		say "no comment."

				ROBIN
		No comment?

				SHEPHERD
		The White House doesn't comment on
		the President's personal life.

				LEWIS
		We can't just leave it at that, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		I tell you what, Lewis, we just did.

				LEWIS
		But, sir...

				A.J.
			   (the meeting's over)
		Thank you, Mr. President.

	LEWIS, ROBIN and A.J. say their "Thank you, Mr. President"'s
	on the way out ...

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		Sydney. Esther'll be in my office.
		You take your time.

				SYDNEY
		Thanks, A.J.

	A.J. leaves...

				SHEPHERD
		I'm sorry about all this. We'll do
		it better next time.

				SYDNEY
		I'm no expert, but I thought we did
		it pretty good this time.

				SHEPHERD
		No, I mean...

				SYDNEY
		I know. I had a good time.

				SHEPHERD
		Me, too. I'll call you. I'll be in
		Panama, but I'll call you.

				SYDNEY
		I'd like that.

	SYDNEY gives him a good-bye kiss...

				SYDNEY
			   (continuing)
		Bye.

	She exits the bedroom.

				SHEPHERD
		All right...okay...this is good.

		Guys, do I have to be here for this

		You're gonna hop out, sir?

				LEWIS
		No, he's not hopping. Sir, no

				SHEPHERD
		Then it's not personal.

		Let the agents do a security sweep.

		Well, congratulations, fellas, you're
		outta the cellar. McSorley told me
		the only thing on the President's

		there are three votes on the crime
		bill that can be bought by stickin'
		the fossil fuel package in a drawer.

				SHEPHERD
		No, the GDC's political director
		didn't tell us anything. Sydney Wade
		told her boyfriend and her
		boyfriend's best friend that she had
		a lousy day.

				A.J.
		It doesn't change the facts, Mr.

		The bill isn't the issue, fellas.
		I'm facing a serious challenge in

				KODAK
		The President's coattail's are gonna

		I just can't give you my vote.

	SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are finishing up dinner.

				SHEPHERD
		This was delicious. Thank you. Is
		there any left?

				SYDNEY
			   (taking his bowl)
		Tons. I didn't think you liked it.

				SHEPHERD
		Are you kidding me, of course I did.
		But actually it's not for me. The
		agent who checked the food thought
		it was delicious, and I sort of told
		him I'd bring him some if there was
		any left.

				SYDNEY
		So you didn't like it.

				SHEPHERD
		No, I loved it.

				SYDNEY
		You're lying.

				SHEPHERD
		No, I'm not.

				SYDNEY
		You are. I can tell when you're
		holding something back. You do a
		thing with your face.

	SYDNEY pops a bottle of port and pours two glasses.

				SHEPHERD
		When have you seen me do a thing
		with my face?

				SYDNEY
		Two days before I met you. You
		gave a speech for the Daughters
		of the American Revolution. I was
		there.

				SHEPHERD
		You were?

				SYDNEY
		You remember the speech?

				SHEPHERD
		Vaguely.

				SYDNEY
		"American can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society."

				SHEPHERD
		Ah.

				SYDNEY
		There was supposed to be something
		else after that, wasn't there?

				SHEPHERD
		How did you know?

				SYDNEY
		I told you. The face.

	SYDNEY hands him a glass. They clink glasses and sip.

				SHEPHERD
		Wow...what's the occasion?

				SYDNEY
		You're looking at a lady who's two
		votes shy of the promised land.

				SHEPHERD
		Two votes?

				SYDNEY
		I got Pennybaker. That got me Cass
		and Zimmer.

				SHEPHERD

		That's great, Sydney. I mean it.
		That's great work.

				SYDNEY
		Well, I'm not there yet.

				SHEPHERD
		Look, no matter what happens, you
		have every right to be proud of
		yourself.

				SYDNEY
		I'll be proud when I see you sign
		the bill.

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah, well...

				SYDNEY
		Andy.

				SHEPHERD
		Yeah?

	INT. CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY

	KODAK sits at his desk staring at a computer printout. LEWIS
	is nearing the end of a phone conversation that isn't going
	well. He's pacing around with the phone...desperate and
	intense.

	The tote board reads: "1 Vote in 2 Days." ROBIN enters.

				ROBIN
			   (to KODAK)
		How're the numbers?

				KODAK
		Bad.

				ROBIN
		How bad?

				KODAK
		Forty-one. Character across the
		board.

				ROBIN
		Who is Lewis on with?

				KODAK
		Jarrett. He's trying to keep his
		finger in the dam.

				LEWIS
			   (into phone)
		You're supposed to be a United States
		Congressman, for the love of Christ.

	ROBIN and KODAK appear in the doorway, sensing a surprise
	development. LEWIS is losing it on the phone.

				LEWIS
			   (continuing; listens)
		But you're not gonna stay at 41.
		The numbers are gonna be go back up.

		But they're gonna go back up.

		George, it's crunch time. It's

		President. Now that's it gonna
		be?

	LEWIS looks over at ROBIN and KODAK ...his face telling the
	story.

				LEWIS
			   (continuing)
		Yeah.
			   (listens)
		Yeah.
			   (listens)
		Hey, George? Can I tell you
		something? We're gonna win this
		thing. We're gonna get the votes
		and we're gonna win. And after we
		do, I mean that very night, I'm
		gonna go to Sam & Harry's, I'm gonna
		order a big steak, and I'm gonna make
		a list of everybody who tried to fuck
		us this week.

	ROBIN and KODAK are trying to get their friend from setting
	fire to a bridge out of pure frustration.

			ROBIN
			   (a whispered shout)
		Lewis!

				LEWIS
			   (into phone)
		Vote your conscience, you chicken-
		shit, lame-ass--

	LEWIS hangs up the phone. He takes a deep breath, slumps
	down in the nearest chair, and looks up at ROBIN and KODAK.

	There's a long silence before LEWIS says--

				LEWIS
			   (continuing)
		We lost Jarrett.

				KODAK
			   (beat)
		I hope so. 'Cause, you know, if
		that was an "undecided," then we
		need to work on our people skills.

	LEWIS picks up the phone and punches in a few numbers. Even
	before that line starts ringing, he picks up another phone
	and punches in a different set of numbers.

				LEWIS
			   (into the first phone)
		Karen, it's Lewis. Could you hunt
		down Congressman Quincy for me. I
		need to talk to him right way.

	SHEPHERD stands in front A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK.
	JANIE is somewhere in the background.

				A.J.
		We lost Quincy, too.

				SHEPHERD
		Did he give a reason?

				LEWIS
		He thinks your numbers aren't likely
		to rebound.

				KODAK
		We're three votes down again, sir.

	There's a pause before ...

				KODAK
			   (continuing)
		Mr. President, as of this morning,
		Sydney only needed one more vote.
		The Motown Three have gotta be
		scared blind. I don't think there'll
		be a better opportunity.

				ROBIN
		The press is expecting an
		announcement on the crime bill by
		the Sate of the Union.

				KODAK
		If you agree to stick 455 in a drawer
		until after the elections, they'll
		give you the three votes.

				ROBIN
			   (beat)
		And we declare victory, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		We said as a last resort.

				KODAK
		We're there, sir. The State of the
		Union is 48 hours away.

				SHEPHERD
		No. Come on. There's gotta be three
		votes someplace else.

				KODAK
		There isn't.

				SHEPHERD
		Bullshit, Leon. There's gotta be
		somebody we haven't--

				KODAK
		There isn't, sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Storch.

				KODAK
		I beg your pardon?

				SHEPHERD
		What about Storch?

				A.J.
		Mr. President--

				KODAK
		Storch is a "no."

				SHEPHERD
		Wagner.

				KODAK
		No.

				SHEPHERD
		Sobel.

				KODAK
		No.

				SHEPHERD
		Clark.

				KODAK
		No.

				SHEPHERD
		Not that Clark, the one from
		Indiana.

				KODAK
			(pause)
		That one too, sir.

	SHEPHERD is stopped.

				A.J.
		Mr. President, I think we have to
		do it.

				SHEPHERD
		She is one vote away, A.J. It's
		important legislation that for the
		first time has a legitimate chance.
		 I think she deserves every possible
		opportunity to--

				LEWIS
		She? You meant "it," didn't you,
		sir? You meant the "important
		legislation" deserves every
		opportunity.

				A.J.
		Lewis, shut up.

	There's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has locked
	eyes with LEWIS.

				SHEPHERD
		You got something to say to me?

				LEWIS
		Respectfully, sir. I think we should
		examine the new poll for more than
		its value as a box score.

				SHEPHERD
		Examine what? They don't like that
		I'm going out with Sydney.

				LEWIS
		It's not that simple, sir. I think
		this poll helps bribg a murky problem
		into specific relief.

				SHEPHERD
		Whose problem we talking about,
		Lewis? Yours? You worried about
		your job? This poll isn't talking
		about my Presidency. This poll is
		talking about my life. Two hundred
		and sixty-four million people have
		decided--

				LEWIS
		Mr. President, two hundred and sixty-
		four million people don't give a damn
		about your life. They give a damn about
		their own.

				A.J.
		All right, that's enough.

				LEWIS
		Mr. President, you've raised a
		daughter almost entirely on your own,
		and she's terrific. What does it say
		to you that in the last seven weeks,
		59 percent of this country has begun
		to question your family values?

				A.J.
		The President doesn't answer to you,
		Lewis.

				LEWIS
		Oh yes, he does, A.J.  I'm a citizen,
		this is my president, and in this
		country it is not only permissible to
		question our leaders, it is our
		responsibility. But you already know
		that, Mr. President, because you have
		a deeper love of this country than
		any man I've ever known, and I want
		to know what it says to you that in
		the past seven weeks 59 percent of
		Americans have begun to question your
		patriotism?

				SHEPHERD
		Look, if people want to listen to Bob
		Rumson--

				LEWIS
		They don't have a choice! Rob
		Rumson's the only one doing the
		talking. People want leadership.
		And in the absence of genuine
		leadership, they will listen to
		anyone who steps up to the
		microphone. They want leadership,
		Mr. President. They're so thirsty
		for it, they'll crawl through the
		desert toward a mirage, and when
		they discover there's no water,
		they'll drink the sand.

				SHEPHERD
			   (evenly)
		Lewis, we've had Presidents who were
		beloved, who couldn't find a coherent
		sentence with two hands and a
		flashlight. People don't drink the
		sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis.
		They drink it 'cause they don't know
		the difference.

	The room is slightly stunned by what their President has just
	said.

	SHEPHERD picks up the polling data and heads to the door...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing; on his
			    way out)
		Make the deal.

	SUSAN, maybe a little drunk, has concerned SYDNEY.

				SUSAN
		I want to go on the record and
		apologize for my attitude toward you
		since your arrival.

				SYDNEY
		I didn't notice. Was there an

	A PHONE RINGS, and one of the staffers takes it. SYDNEY
	tries to rejoin the party, but--

				SUSAN
		I think I have a lot of pent-up
		hostility.

				SYDNEY
		Well--

				SUSAN
		I wonder who I can blame it on.

				SYDNEY
		I'm not really qualified to--

				SUSAN
		'Cause I've been blaming it on my

		hasn't been working.

				DAVID

		Leo needs to see you.

				SYDNEY
		Tell him to get over here. It's a

				DAVID
		He needs to see you in his office.

		Don't worry about it.

	SYDNEY is going through the closet in search of something.
	The door opens, and SHEPHERD steps in, perhaps a little
	tentatively. He doesn't see SYDNEY at first.

				SHEPHERD

		Syd?

	SYDNEY comes out.

				SYDNEY
		Have you seen a gray cableknit
		sweater?

				SHEPHERD
		A grey...sweater? No. I called

				SYDNEY
		It's Beth's. I wore it here one
		time, and I didn't want to leave
		it.

				SHEPHERD
		Where were you going?

	SYDNEY continues her search.

				SYDNEY
		I'm going home, and then I'm going
		to Hartford.

				SHEPHERD
		Connecticut?

				SYDNEY
		Yes. Do you know if it was sent with
		your dry cleaning by any--

				SHEPHERD
		What's in Connecticut?

				SYDNEY
		Richard Reynolds' campaign. He may
		be able to get me a job.

				SHEPHERD
		When did you decide to get a new job?

				SYDNEY
		Not long after Leo Solomon fired me
		from my old one. Beth's gonna kill
		me. She loves that--

				SHEPHERD
		Why did he fire you?

				SYDNEY
		Total failure to achieve any of the
		objectives for which I was hired. I
		told him he was being unreasonable.
		After all, I did get to dance with
		the President and ride in Air Force
		One a couple of times. But you know
		those prickly environmentalists.
		It's always gonna be something with
		them. If it's not clean air, then
		it's clean water. Like it isn't good
		enough that I'm on the cover of
		People Magazine.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll call him.

				SYDNEY
		You'll call him? You mean you'll
		call him yourself? Personally?
		It'll come from the President?
		That's a great idea. I think you
		should call Leo and make a deal. He
		hires me back for, say, 72 days. I
		go around scaring the hell out of
		Congress, making them think that the
		President's about to drive through a
		very damaging and costly bill.
		They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm
		the President's Friday Night Girl.
		Now I don't know if you can dip into
		this well twice, especially since
		I've lost all credibility in politics,
		but you never know, I might just be
		able to pull it off again. I might
		be able to give you just the leverage
		you need to pass some ground-breaking
		piece of crime legislation -- like a
		mandatory three-day waiting period
		before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi.
		Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to
		learn to live with disappointment.

	She starts to exit

				SHEPHERD
		What do you think went on here today?

	She stops.

				SYDNEY
		I know exactly what went on here
		today. I got screwed. You saw the
		poll, you needed the crime bill,
		you couldn't get it on your own,
		so I got screwed.

				SHEPHERD

		The environment got screwed. Nothing
		happened to you today, Sydney.
		Governing is choosing. Governing is
		prioritizing. I've made no secret of
		the fact that the crime bill was my
		top priority.

				SYDNEY
		Well then, congratulations. It's
		only taken you three years to put
		together crime prevention legislation
		that has no hope of preventing crime.

	SYDNEY heads out the door--

				SHEPHERD
			(stopping)
		Sydney. Please. I don't want to

		Has Rumson lied in the last seven

				A.J.
		Has he lied?

				SHEPHERD
		Other than not knowing the difference

		not opposed to a Constitutional

				A.J.

				A.J.
		We fight the fights we can win.

				SHEPHERD
		Don't--

		You fight the fights that need

				A.J.
		I beg your pardon.

				SHEPHERD
		It occurs to me that in 25 years I've
		never seen your name on a ballot.
		Why have you always been standing a

				A.J.
		Because if I hadn't been, you'd be
		the most popular history professor
		at the University of Wisconsin.

				SHEPHERD
		Fuck you.

	SHEPHERD's tossed his cue stick and is heading out...

		We're done.

				SHEPHERD
		You're done?

				LUCY
		We ratified it last week.

				SHEPHERD
		Oh...well...that's good. Why didn't
		you tell me?

				LUCY
		It's not a big deal, Dad.

				SHEPHERD
		Okay, I give up. I don't care why
		you're not happy in social studies.
		I care about why you're not talking
		to me about why you're not happy in
		social studies.

				LUCY
		Dad, I'm perfectly--

				SHEPHERD
		You're not perfectly happy. You
		don't think I know when something's
		bothering you?

				LUCY
		Damnit, Dad!

				SHEPHERD
		Hey!

				LUCY
		You know--

				SHEPHERD
		Talk to me.

				LUCY
		Look--

	LUCY winds herself up. It would appear she's about to burst.
	She's about to say the hardest thing she's ever had to say in
	her life--

				LUCY
			   (continuing)
		--sometimes when you talk, you say
		things I disagree with.

	SHEPHERD is stunned and totally confused...

				SHEPHERD
		Almost every time I talk, I say
		things you disagree with.

				LUCY
		I mean politically.

				SHEPHERD
			   (pause)
		Politically?

				LUCY
		Yes.

				SHEPHERD
			   (pause)
		What do you mean?

	It just starts spilling out in a stream--

				LUCY
		Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,
		I'm not sure. You know a lot more
		than I do -- but still, I have these
		feelings, and I don't think they're
		wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm
		not so sure it's all right to burn a
		flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot
		of people, and I don't know why you
		think it's okay. I hear Senator
		Rumson talk, and some of the things
		he says sounds right to me, and I
		think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!
		I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad
		hates this guy!
		Why am I agreeing with him" And then
		I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really
		like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not
		like Dad either." But the point is
		I'm the President's kid, and people
		pay attention to what I say, and if
		I say something different from what
		you say, it'll be embarrassing for
		you. So I can't just get up in social
		studies class and say whatever I want.

	SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely
	no idea...

	He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know
	what's coming...

				SHEPHERD
			   (quietly)
		Stand up please.

	LUCY gets up slowly...

	She's never seen her father like this...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		I want you to pay very close
		attention to what happens now.

	SHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,
	and gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and
	holds her in a tight embrace...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		In your  lifetime, you will never
		embarrass me. It could never happen.
		You're not the President's daughter,
		Lucy, you're mine.
		And no one's gonna vote me out of
		that job. You're my daughter, and
		everything else is a distant second.
			   (more)
		School is for you, Lucy. You say
		what you want. The only thing you
		have to do to make me happy is
		come home at the end of the day.

	LUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a
	long moment.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		One more thing. I don't dislike
		Senator Rumson because of his
		political views. And even if you
		voted for everything he would vote
		for, that wouldn't make you like him.
		There's a fundamental difference
	between you and the Bob Rumsons of
		the world.

				LUCY
		What's that?

				SHEPHERD
		The difference is that he says he
		loves America. Saying you love
		America is easy. What takes
		character -- and this is what you
		have--

	SHEPHERD trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		What takes character is loving
		Americans.
			   (beat)

	And now it's as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the
	longest trip of his life...

	...he looks over at the T.V. monitor..."No comment"...
	"No, I don't know how many other ways I can say it. The
	White House isn't getting involved in..."

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Luce, I gotta go.

				LUCY
		Dad, is everything all right?

				SHEPHERD
		Everything's fine. I'm just a little
		late for work.

	He heads for the door, shouting out as he goes--

				SHEPHERD
		Somebody get my daughter some food!
		The girl's from Wisconsin, for cryin'
		out loud!

	And he's gone as we...

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

	ROBIN is on her last drops of energy and patience.

				REPORTER #4
		Robin, will the President ever
		respond to Senator Rumson's
		question about being a member of
		the American Civil Liberties Union?

	But instead of hands going up, the PRESS CORPS suddenly
	stands. ROBIN turns to see SHEPHERD stride in and step up to
	the podium.

				SHEPHERD
		Yes, he will. 'Morning.

				ROBIN
		Good morning, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD takes the podium. There's a palpable BUZZ in the
	room as video operators adjust their equipment, etc. People
	starts to stand.

				SHEPHERD
		That's all right, you can keep your
		seats. For the last couple of
		months, Senator Rumson has suggested
		that being president of this country
		was, to a certain extent, about
		character...

	ANGLE - ROBIN

	who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in
	four numbers.

	She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the
	rest of the room.

				ROBIN
			   (into phone)
		Lewis...call A.J. and come on down
		here...I don't know, but
		something's happening.

				SHEPHERD
		...and although I have not been
		willing to engage in his attacks on
		me, I've been here three years and
		three days, and I can tell you
		without hesitation: Being President
		of this country is entirely about
		character.

	LEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		For the record: Yes, I am a card-
		carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But
		the more important question is why
		aren't you, Bob? This is an
		organization whose sole purpose is to
		defend the Bill of Rights, so it
		naturally begs the questions.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Why would a senator, his party's most
		powerful spokesman and a candidate
		for president, choose to reject
		upholding the Constitution? If you
		can answer that question, then,
		folks, you're smarter than I am,
		because I didn't understand it until
		a couple of minutes ago. Everybody
		knows American isn't easy. America is
		advanced citizenship.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's
		gonna put up a fight. It's gonna
		say, "You want free speech? Let's
		see you acknowledge a man whose words
		make your blood boil, who's standing
		center stage and advocating, at the
		top of his lungs, that which you
		would spend a lifetime opposing at the
		top of yours. You want to claim
		this land as the land of the free,
		then the symbol of your country can't
		just be a flag; the symbol also has
		to be one of its citizens exercising
		his right to burn that flag in
		protest." Show me that, defend that,
		celebrate that in your classrooms.
		Then you can stand up and sing about
		the land of the free. I've known Bob
		Rumson for years. I've been operating
		under the assumption that the reason
		Bob devotes so much time and energy to
		shouting at the rain was that he simply
		didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't
		get it. Bob's problem is that he
		can't sell it. Nobody has ever won
		an election by talking about what I
		was just talking about.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		This is a country made up of people
		with hard jobs that they're terrified
		of losing. The roots of freedom are
		of little or no interest to them at
		the moment. We are a nation afraid
		to go out at night. We're a society
		that has assigned low priority to
		education and has looked the other
		way while our public schools have
		been decimated. We have serious
		problems to solve, and we need
		serious men to solve them. And
		whatever your particular problem is,
		friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
		not the least bit interested in
		solving it. He is interested in two
		things and two things only: Making
		you afraid of it and telling you
		who's to blame for it. That, ladies
		and gentlemen, is how you win
		elections. You gather a group of
		middle-aged, middle-class, middle-
		income voters who remember with
		longing an easier time, and you talk
		to them about family and American
		values and personal character. Then
		you have an old photo of the
		President's girlfriend. You scream
		about patriotism and you tell them
		she's to blame for their lot in life,
		you go on television and you call her
		a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
		nothing to you, Bob. She has done
		nothing but put herself through law
		school, prosecute criminals for five
		years, represent the interests of
		public school teachers for two years,
		and lobby for the safety of our
		natural resources.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		You want a character debate? Fine,
		but you better stick with me, 'cause
		Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
		league. I've loved two women in my
		life. I lost one to cancer, and I
		lost the other 'cause I was so busy
		keeping my job I forgot to do my job.
		Well that ends right now.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Tomorrow morning the White House is
		sending a bill to Congress for its
		consideration. It's White House
		Resolution 455, an energy bill
		requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
		emission of fossil fuels over the
		next ten years. It is by far the
		most aggressive stride ever taken in
		the fight to reverse the effects of
		global warming. The other piece of
		legislation is the crime bill. As of
		today it no longer exists. I'm
		throwing it out. I'm throwing it out
		and writing a law that makes sense.
		You cannot address crime prevention
		without getting rid of assault
		weapons and handguns.
		I consider them a threat to national
		security, and I will go door to door
		if I have to, but I'm gonna convince
		Americans that I'm right, and I'm
		gonna get the guns. We've got
		serous problems, and we need serious
		men, and if you want to talk about
		character, Bob, you'd better come at
		me with more than a burning flag and
		a membership card. If you want to
		talk about character and American
		values, fine. Just tell me where and
		when, and I'll show up. This is a
		time for serious men, Bob, and your
		fifteen minutes are up. My name's
		Andrew Shepherd, and I am the
		President.

	SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his
	wake.

	The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking
	among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they
	just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.

				ROBIN
		Any questions?

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY

	A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President.

				A.J.
		Well, you don't see that every day
		of the week.

				LEWIS
		He's got the whole White House Press
		Corps asking each other how to spell
		"erudite."

				A.J.
		Lewis, call the printer.

				LEWIS
		I know. Gotta rewrite the State of
		the Union.

				A.J.
		Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new
		ball game. You've got 35 minutes.

				LEWIS
		Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed.

	LEWIS goes off in one direction. A.J. heads towards the Oval
	Office.

                                                            CUT TO:

	INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	SHEPHERD is on the phone.

				SHEPHERD
		I don't want the limo. I don't want
		an escort.

	A.J. enters.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		I want a plain, ordinary, non-
		bullet-proof automobile. Someone
		around here must have a Chevy I
		can borrow. Well, find one and
		meet me outside the West Wing
		entrance in five minutes.

				A.J.
		Where are you going?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm going to her house. I'm gonna
		stand at her front door till she
		lets me in. And I'm not leaving till
		I get her back.

				A.J.
		How're you gonna do that?

				SHEPHERD
		I haven't worked that out yet. But
		I'm sure groveling will be involved.

				A.J.
		You're just gonna drive over?

				SHEPHERD
		I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the
		most powerful army in the world.
		You don't think I can drive ten blocks?

				SYDNEY
		Just stay away from DuPont Circle.
		I hear it's murder this time of day.

	SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing
	in the doorway, but of course he does anyway.

				SYDNEY
		Hi, A.J.

				A.J.
		It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If
		anybody needs me, I'll be in the
		Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.

	A.J. exits.

				SYDNEY
		I heard your speech. I was in my
		car, and it just kind of steered
		its way over here.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm glad.

	SYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and
	smile. SYDNEY starts toward him.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Sydney, I didn't decide to send
		455 to the floor to get you back.

				SYDNEY
		I didn't come back 'cause you decided
		to send 455 to the floor.

	They move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because...

				LEWIS
			   (entering)
		Mr. President, I thought you might
		want to look at this. I moved Social
		Security up front. Hello, Sydney.

	JANIE enters--

				JANIE
		Mr. President, Leventhal at
		Treasury wants two minutes. Hello,
		Sydney.

	MRS. CHAPIL enters--

				MRS. CHAPIL
		Mr. President -- Excuse me, Miss
		Wade -- Miss McCall is on her way
		over.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to SYDNEY)
		I've got some things to do.

				SYDNEY
		Yes, you do.

	                                                     CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAPITOL - NIGHT

	It's lit up and glowing on this cold, clear night.

				ANCHOR (V.O.)
		We're only a moment or two away from
		the arrival of President Shepherd and
		his State of the Union address.
		Lloyd, you've served on the staffs of
		several past administrations, what
		kind of last-minute activity is the
		President engaged in right now?

	                                                     CUT TO:

	INT. A VIP ROOM - NIGHT

	It's off the main corridor, and it's being used as a green
	room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JANIE,
	and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around in
	a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff
	links.

				SHEPHERD
		I'm having a cuff links crisis.

	LUCY takes his sleeves.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing; to LUCY)
		I think they've locked.

				LUCY
		Hold still.

	ROBIN steps in.

				ROBIN
		Mr. President, they're waiting for
		you.


				LUCY
		All done.

				SHEPHERD
		Lewis.

				LEWIS
		Sir.

				SHEPHERD
		Things have been a little rough
		between us lately.

				LEWIS
		I know sir, I'm sorry.

				SHEPHERD
		Don't stop what you're doing.

				LEWIS
		That's kind of you, sir, but I
		realize I've been a little
		insensitive about some personal...

				SHEPHERD
		No, you were right. Two hundred and
		sixty-four million people don't give
		a damn about my life.

				LEWIS
		Just so you know I've never been one
		of them, Mr. President.

				ROBIN
		This way, people. Let's go.

				SHEPHERD
			   (to LEWIS)
		See you after.

	The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit,
	ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as
	she herds people out the door.

	LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered
	textbook and has it opened to a specific page...

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		Whatcha got there, Luce?

				LUCY
		Article 2, Section 3, of the U.S.
		Constitution. Executive Powers.
			   (reading)
		"He shall, from time to time, give to
		the Congress information of the State
		of the Union, and recommend to their
		consideration such measures as he
		shall judge necessary and expedient."

				A.J.
		Sounds right up your alley.

	SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a
	deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then
	pulls him into a strong embrace.

	A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		Give 'em hell, Andy.

	A.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without
	having to speak--

				A.J.
			   (continuing)
		You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.

				SHEPHERD
		Thank you.
			   (to LUCY)
		I'll see you afterward. I want a
		critique.

	The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the
	First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		There's been something I've been
		trying to give you since our first
		date. I tried a bunch of times, but
		somehow I've always managed to trip
		over my job.
			   (beat)
		Anyay...

	SHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold
	Presidential seal.

	He reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers.

				SHEPHERD
			   (continuing)
		These are for you.

				SYDNEY
		They're beautiful.

	JANIE pokes her head in.

				JANIE
		Mr. President?

				SHEPHERD
		Gotta go.

				SYDNEY
		Should I stay here?

				SHEPHERD
		No, walk with me.

	They exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS,
	SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,
	most prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK.

	SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double
	doors to the House Chamber--

				SYDNEY
		How'd you finally do it?

				SHEPHERD
			   (raising his voice
			    above the cheering)
		Do what?

				SYDNEY
		Manage to give a woman flowers and
		be President at the same time.

				SHEPHERD
		Well...it turns out I've got a rose
		garden.

	SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--

	--the doors to the Chamber fly open--

				DOORKEEPER
		Mr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
		UNITED STATES!!!

	The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,
	shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...

	At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain
	their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to
	get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both
	hands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking
	hands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and we

	FADE OUT.

"An American Werewolf in London" -- by John Landis

 



     FADE IN

1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT

     on the moon.

     EXT. MOON

     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
     song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are
     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
     superimposed.

               An American Werewolf in London

     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.

2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a
     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
     have earned their literary reputation.

     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
     climbs down.

     "Moon Shadow" ends.


                                                  CUT TO:

     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both
     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.

     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and
     stretch.

     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER

     They've been cramped for hours.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
               Here, lads, East Proctor and
               all about are the moors.  I go
               east here.

                         JACK
               Yes, well thank you very much
               for the ride, sir.  You have
               lovely sheep.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
                    (as he clambers back
                     up on his truck)
               Boys, keep off the moors.
               Stay on the road.  Good luck
               to you.

                         DAVID
               Thanks again!

     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put
     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
     towards East Proctor.

     EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     As they walk, their breath visible:

                         JACK
               Are you cold?

                         DAVID
               Yes.

                         JACK
               Good.

     They walk on, finally:

                         DAVID
               Jack.

                         JACK
               David.

                         DAVID
               You're not having a good time
               are you?

                         JACK
               Oh, I don't know.  I mean look
               around.  Isn't this a fun
               place?

     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
     foreboding.

                         DAVID
               Well, I like it here.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.  Northern England
               first, Italy later.

                         DAVID
               Right.

     They walk on.
                         JACK
               Do you think she'll meet me in
               Rome?

                         DAVID
               I think Debbie Klein is a
               mediocre person with a good
               body.

                         JACK
               Debbie is not mediocre and she
               has one of the great bodies of
               all time.

                         DAVID
               She's a jerk.

                         JACK
               You're talking about the woman
               I love.

                         DAVID
               I'm talking about a girl you
               want to fuck, so give me a
               break.

                         JACK
               Well, anyway, do you think
               she'll be there?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.

                         JACK
                    (like an announcer)
               Rendezvous in Rome starring
               Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.
               The love affair that shocked
               Europe!  See torrid lovemaking
               at its most explicit!  See
               Jack and Debbie expose their
               lust in the sacred halls of
               the Vatican!  Never has the
               screen dared....

                         DAVID
               If you don't stop, I'm going
               to kill you.

                         JACK
               I have to make love to her.
               It's very simple.  She has no
               choice really.

                         DAVID
               It just fascinates me that you
               can spend so much energy on
               someone so dull.

                         JACK
               It is impossible for a body
               like that to be dull.

                         DAVID
               We've known Debbie what, since
               the eighth grade?  How many
               years of foreplay is that?

                         JACK
               She says she `likes me too
               much'.

     David just laughs and laughs and laughs.


                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

3    EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly
     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a
     very small population and the place looks empty.  David
     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The
     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and
     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.

4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
     Slaughtered Lamb".

                         JACK
               The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed fox head on a
               spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's a wolf's head.

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed wolf's head on
               a spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's not a spear.  It's a
               pike.

                         DAVID
               A severed wolf's head on a
               pike as their symbol.

                         JACK
               David, before we go in there I
               want you to know that - no
               matter what happens to us -
               it's your fault.

                         DAVID
               I assume full responsibility.

                         JACK
               Okay.

                         DAVID
               Shall we?

5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with
     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by
     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older
     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are
     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is
     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about
     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They
     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types
     and the general level of noise in the room.

     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead
     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
     strange attention.  They give each other a "what?"
     look, then turn to the assembled populace.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Nice to see you.

     FACES

     Silent and staring.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID AND JACK

                         DAVID
                    (smiles)
               It's very cold outside.  May
               we come in?

     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over
     to a table and very self-consciously remove their
     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman
     finally comes over to them.

                         JACK
               Do you have any hot soup?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         DAVID
               Well, do you have any coffee?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Hot chocolate?
                         WOMAN
               We've got spirits and beer.
               If it's something hot you
               want, you can have tea.

                         JACK
               Then you have some hot tea?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Oh.

                         WOMAN
               But I can heat some up for you
               if you'd like.

                         DAVID & JACK
               Yes, please.

     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.

                         JACK
               Nice looking group.

                         DAVID
               Listen, at least it's warm in
               here.

                         JACK
               Look at that.

                                                  CUT TO:

     JACK'S P.O.V.

     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.

                         DAVID
               What about it?

                         JACK
               It's a five-pointed star.

                         DAVID
               Maybe the owners are from
               Texas.

     The Woman brings them their tea.

                         JACK
                    (to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?

                         WOMAN
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               He was joking.  Thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Joking?  I remember The Alamo.
               I saw it once in London, in
               Leicester Square.

     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS
     explains:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               She means in the cinema, that
               film with John Wayne.
                    (turns to board)
               Checkmate.

                         DAVID
               Oh, yes, of course.

                         JACK
               Right, with Laurence Harvey
               and everybody died in it.  It
               was very bloody.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Bloody awful if you ask me!

     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.  Jack and
     David smile politely.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you
               hear the one about the
               crashing plane?

                         WOMAN
               No, but we're about to.

     Laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               You be quiet, woman, and let
               me speak.

                         WOMAN
                    (heavy sarcasm)
               Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

     Uproarious laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               All right, laugh then.  I
               shan't tell it.

                         WOMAN
               Oh, come on, tell us.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No.  You've had your chance.

     The men all coax him to tell the joke.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Ask them what the candles are
               for.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Listen, that's a pentangle, a
               five-pointed star.  It's used
               in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,
               Jr. and Universal Studios
               maintain it's the mark of the
               wolf man.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               I see.  You want me to ask
               these people if they're
               burning candles to ward off
               monsters.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Right.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Wrong.
     The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
     joke as everyone knew he would.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, all right.  There was this
               airplane over the Atlantic on
               its way to New York.  It was
               full of men from the United
               Nations.

                         WOMAN
               That's very funny, that is.

     Uproarious laughter.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Go on, ask them.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here now, let me finish!  So
               halfway over the ocean the
               engines run low on petrol so
               they have to lighten the
               plane.  So they heave out all
               the baggage, but it's still
               too heavy.  So they chuck out
               the seats, but it's still too
               heavy!  Finally this Froggy
               steps up and shouts "Viva la
               France" and leaps out.  Then
               an Englishman....

                         DART PLAYERS
               Hear!  Hear!

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (undaunted)
               ...steps up and shouts `God
               save the Queen!' and leaps
               out.  But the plane is still
               too heavy.  So the Yank
               delegate from Texas steps up,
               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
               and chucks out the Mexican.

     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is
     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the
     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
     Player gasps out...
                         DART PLAYER
               Remember the Alamo!

     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.

                         JACK
               Excuse me, but what's that
               star on the wall for?

     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and
     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look
     hard indeed.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               You've made me miss.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.

                         DART PLAYER
               I've never missed the board
               before.

                         DAVID
               Jack, we'd better go.

                         JACK
               What do you mean?  I'm
               starving.

                         DART PLAYER
               There's no food here.

     The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
     bit urgent.

                         DAVID
               Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

                         JACK
               Apparently so.

     The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
     for the door.

                         WOMAN
                    (to men)
               You can't let them go.

                         DAVID
                    (worried)
               How much do we owe you?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nothing, lads.  Go, God be
               with you.

                         DAVID
               Uh, thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Wait!  You just can't let them
               go!

                         DART PLAYER
               Go!  And stay on the road.
               Keep clear of the moors.

                         DAVID
               Yes, well, thanks again.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Beware the moon, lads!

     David pushes Jack out.

6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is very cold.

                         JACK
               What the hell was that all
               about?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Let's see if
               there's an inn or something up
               the road.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon?

                         DAVID
               Come on, I'm freezing.

     They start up the road into the night.

7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is quiet.

                         WOMAN
               You can't let them go.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               Should the world know our
               business?!

                         CHESS PLAYER
               It's murder then.

                         DART PLAYER
               Then murder it is!  It's in
               God's hands now.

     The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
     floor.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

     walking on the road surrounded by darkness.

                         DAVID
               That was weird.  I guess
               leaving was the best idea.

                         JACK
               I don't know.  Now that we're
               out here and it's three
               degrees, I'm not so sure I
               wouldn't rather face a blood-
               thirsty mob.

                         DAVID
               Well, not quite a blood-
               thirsty mob.

     They keep walking.

                         JACK
               What do you think was wrong?

                         DAVID
               I have no idea.

                         JACK
               Maybe that pentangle was for
               something supernatural.

                         DAVID
               I see and they were too
               embarrassed to talk about it,
               because they felt so silly.
     There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
     illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The
     clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.

                         DAVID
               Please don't rain.

     Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.

                         DAVID
               Of course.

     They walk getting soaked.

                         JACK
               Say, David....

                         DAVID
               I'm well aware of how pleasant
               the weather is in Rome at the
               present time thank you.

     Jack spreads his arms and sings.

                         JACK
               Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.

9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
     windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess
     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.

                         WOMAN
               Perhaps they'll be safe in the
               rain.

     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No one brought them here!  No
               one wanted them here!

                         WOMAN
               You could have told them!

                         DART PLAYER
               Are you daft?  What do you
               think they'd say?  They'd
               think us mad.

                         WOMAN
               Listen!

     The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl.

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear it?  We must go
               to them.

                         DART PLAYER
               I heard nothing.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
     shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess
     Player turns suddenly.

10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from
     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is
     a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The
     drizzle stops.

                         JACK
               Did you hear that?

                         DAVID
               I heard that.

                         JACK
               What was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.

                         DAVID
               Could be a lot of things.

                         JACK
               Yeah?

                         DAVID
               A coyote.

                         JACK
               There aren't any coyotes in
               England.

                         DAVID
               The Hound of the Baskervilles.

                         JACK
               Pecos Bill.

                         DAVID
               Heathcliffe.

                         JACK
               Heathcliffe didn't howl.

                         DAVID
               No, but he was on the moors.

                         JACK
               It's a full moon, `beware the
               moon'.

     Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very
     inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

                         JACK
               I vote we go back to The
               Slaughtered Lamb.

                         DAVID
               Yeah.

     They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
     from where they just came.  Although after a bit of
     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out
     of breath.

                         DAVID
               We're lost.

     Another bloodcurdling howl.

                         JACK
               Shit!  David, what is that?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Come on.

                         JACK
               Come on, where?

                         DAVID
               Anywhere!  I think we should
               just keep moving.

     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the
     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something
     out there.  It starts to walk.

                         DAVID
               It's moving.

                         JACK
               It's circling us.

     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four
     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.

                         JACK
               Fuck.

     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It
     sits breathing heavily.

                         DAVID
               What's the plan?

                         JACK
                    (nervously)
               Plan?

                         DAVID
                    (not too relaxed
                     himself)
               Let's just keep walking.

     They do and David keeps talking as they walk.

                         DAVID
               That's right, a lovely stroll
               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,
               isn't this fun?

     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys
     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.

                         DAVID
               It's in front of us.

                         JACK
               Do you think it's a dog?

     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.

     BOYS' P.O.V.

     Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking
     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
     and its breath is visible.

                         JACK
               Oh shit.  What is that?

                         DAVID
               A sheep dog or something.
               Turn slowly and let's walk
               away.

     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.

                         JACK
               Nice doggie.  Good boy.

                         DAVID
               Walk away, Jack.

                         JACK
               Walking away, yes, sir.  Here
               we are walking away.

     They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes
     flight they stop, panting.

                         DAVID
               See anything?

                         JACK
               No.

     A moment of quiet, then a howl.

                         DAVID
               It sounds far away.

                         JACK
               Not far enough.  Come on.

     They walk briskly.

                         DAVID
               Jack?

                         JACK
               Yeah.

                         DAVID
               Where are we going?

                         JACK
               I'll tell you when we get
               there.

                         DAVID
               Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays
     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
     Jack laugh.

                         JACK
               You really scared me, you
               shithead.

                         DAVID
               Are you going to help me up?

     Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
     THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!

     EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

     The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.
     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and
     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to
     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams
     and the wolf's roars combine.

                         JACK
               Jesus fuck!  David!  Please
               help me!  Please!  David!
               Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath.

                         DAVID
               Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!

     He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody
     mess on the ground.  He stares in horror.

                         DAVID
               Jack....

     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as
     he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs
     clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the
     hulking form rolls off of him.

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,
     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers
     crowd around, David falls back and faints.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital
     room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder
     bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.
     There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and
     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his
     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look
     around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls
     out....

                         DAVID
               Jack?!

     ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a
     nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very
     beautiful.  She goes to the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her
     thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     David remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS
     GALLAGHER, comes in.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He all right?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think.  He
               called out just now.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He's an American, you know.
               Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch
               round one of those Embassy
               fellows to see him.

                         ALEX
               Chart says he's from New York.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I think he's a Jew.

                         ALEX
               Why on earth do you say that?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I looked.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Really, Susan, I don't think
               that was very proper, and
               besides, it's common practice
               now.

     A voice startles the girls.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss
               Price is quite right.

     DR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the
     customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring
     presence.  The girls are embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried
               out a minute ago.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, surely you
               must perform some function
               here at the hospital.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Then get on with it.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

     She exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex
     watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Can I be of service, Miss
               Price?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Go about your duties.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

     She starts to exit.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, Miss Price?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What exactly did he call out?

                         ALEX
               He said `Jack'.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               That would be Jack Goodman,
               the boy who was killed.

                         ALEX
               What happened to them?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The police report said an
               escaped lunatic attacked them.
               He must have been a very
               powerful man.  Although I
               really don't see that it is
               any of your concern, Miss
               Price.

                         ALEX
               No, sir.  Of course, sir.
               Good day, Doctor.

     She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination,
     looking into David's eyes.

12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the
     almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the
     footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.  The
     camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about,
     the panting continuing.  The breathing gets louder and
     harder, then too loud when we:

                                                  CUT TO:

13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
     contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing
     beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr.
     Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch
               and this is a countryman of
               yours, Mr. Collins.

                         DAVID
               Where am I?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're in a hospital in
               London.

                         DAVID
               London?  Where's Jack?  I had
               a strange dream.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I should think so after your
               recent traumatic experiences.

                         DAVID
               The guy I was with.  Is he all
               right?  How did I get to
               London?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (quietly)
               Now, David, I want you to
               prepare yourself; your friend
               is dead.
     David jolts up in bed and shouts.

                         DAVID
               What?

     The sudden exertion and strain hurt.

                         DAVID
               Ow, shit!

     He sinks back down.

                         DAVID
               Jack's dead?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins
               of the American Embassy here
               in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr.
               Goodman's parents and your
               parents have been notified of
               your injuries and everything's
               in order.

                         DAVID
               Everything's in order?  What
               are you talking about?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Goodman's body has been
               air-freighted back to New York
               for burial and your parents
               have wired funds for your stay
               in the hospital until you are
               well enough to fly home.

                         DAVID
                    (controlled tears)
               You don't crate and ship Jack
               like some side of beef.
                    (approaching hysteria)
               Who the hell are you people?
               What's going on here?  Where
               is Jack?  I demand to see him!

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (holds David down,
                     calls out)
               Miss Price!  Miss Price,
               please!

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Get your fucking hands off me!
               What the hell is going on
               here?

     Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion.

                         MR. COLLINS
                    (distraught, clutching
                     his briefcase)
               I realize how upsetting this
               must be for you, Mr. Kessler,
               but please try to refrain from
               hysterics.

     David continues shouting and struggling.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Prepare a hypodermic, please,
               Miss Price.

     The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr.
     Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more
     normal.

                         MR. COLLINS
               Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to
               excite yourself.  Everything
               has been arranged.  I shall
               come back to check on your
               progress and send a report to
               your parents.  The police have
               requested to interview you and
               I have given them permission
               to do so.

     Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Thank you very much, Mr.
               Collins.  He'll rest now and
               I'm sure everything will be
               fine once he's adjusted.  He's
               had quite a shock.

                         MR. COLLINS
               These dumb-ass kids never
               appreciate anything you do for
               them.

     Mr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.

                         DAVID
               How long have I been here?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've been unconscious since
               you were brought in two weeks
               ago.

                         DAVID
               Two weeks?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've suffered some rather
               severe cuts and bruises, lost
               a bit of blood, but nothing
               too serious; black and blue
               for a while.  You'll have some
               dueling scars to boast of.
               That lunatic must have been a
               very fierce fellow.  They say
               a mad man has the strength of
               ten.

                         DAVID
                    (softly, as the drugs
                     take hold)
               Lunatic?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now we've just given you a
               pretty strong sedative, so try
               to get some rest now.  Miss
               Price will see to your needs.
               Rest now.

     Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers.

                         DAVID
                    (softly)
               It wasn't a lunatic.

                         ALEX
                    (puzzled)
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               It was a wolf.

                         ALEX
                    (bends down close
                     to hear)
               What?

                         DAVID
               A wolf.

     David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did he say a wolf?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I believe he did.

     Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.

14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk
     calendar.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               But Roger is so terribly
               boring.  Yes, dear, but
               couldn't we...I see.
                    (he makes a note)
               Thursday at eight, dinner with
               boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I
               will; if I survived Rommel, I
               suppose I'll survive another
               excruciating evening with
               Roger Mathison.  Be a good
               girl.  Bye.

     He hangs up very disgruntled.  The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
               are here to see you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Send them in.

     He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall,
     the other rather pudgy.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come in, come in.  Please sit.
               Some tea?

     The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a
     small notebook.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               I'd like some tea, please.

     Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe
               later.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's no problem.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Well, then, what can I do for
               Scotland Yard?

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We understand the Kessler boy
               has regained consciousness.

     Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Sorry.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has Mr. Kessler said anything
               regarding the attack on the
               moors?

     The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Excuse me.  Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Roger Mathison, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What here?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               He's on the telephone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Tell him I'm out.  No, tell
               him I've passed away.  An old
               war wound or something.  Tell
               him I'm dead.  And no more
               calls!

     He turns from the intercom back to the cops.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You were saying?

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has David Kessler anything to
               say concerning the attack on
               the moors?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Why don't we ask him?

15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David sits up in bed.  Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
     stand by his side.  Dr. Hirsch sits observing.

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry if I conflict with
               your report, but Jack and I
               were not attacked by a man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               So you've said.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               He may have a point,
               Lieutenant.  Two strong boys
               would be able to defend
               themselves against one man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Sgt. McManus, are you
               suggesting that David and Jack
               were, in fact, attacked by
               some animal and that the
               officialdom of East Proctor
               has conspired to keep it a
               secret?  We have an autopsy
               report on the murderer who was
               shot in the act by the local
               police.  We have two witnesses
               to the crime.  You'll forgive
               me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider
               your testimony as coming from
               someone who has gone through a
               terrible shock.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Lieutenant, the boy seems
               pretty lucid to me and....

                         LT. VILLIERS
               And what, Sergeant?

                         SGT. McMANUS
                    (defeated)
               I don't rightly know, sir.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               That is precisely my point.
               David, as far as we are
               concerned, the matter is
               closed.  We won't trouble you
               any further.  Good day.

     The lieutenant goes for the door.  The sergeant smiles
     at David and follows.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Doctor.

     The cops exit.  Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.

                         DAVID
               There were witnesses?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               So they said.

                         DAVID
               How could there have been
               witnesses?  It was so dark.
               We were running and I fell and
               Jack went to help me up and
               this thing came from
               nowhere...I don't understand
               what they're talking about.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               In time I'm sure it will all
               come back to you.

                         DAVID
               Doctor, my memory is fine.
               It's my sanity I'm beginning
               to worry about.

                                                  CUT TO:

16   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through
     the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the
     runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs
     for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.
     David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness
     of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements,
     looking about.

     CLOSEUP

     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
     animalness.

     DAVID

     takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and
     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with
     him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We
     see him completely as the animal, study his movement
     and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops
     again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly
     he pushes some leaves aside.

     CLOSEUP

     of his eyes.

     DAVID'S P.O.V.

     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and
     freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The
     buck turns his head, feeling the danger.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders
     tensing.

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

                                                  TO:

     THE FAWN

     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame
     as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame,
     his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered
     with blood.  He howls in triumph.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door
     opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss
     Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to
     David, turns on the bed light and touches him.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.

                         DAVID
                    (awakened)
               I was having a nightmare.

     Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the
     pills and pouring a glass of water.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, well these should help
               that.  That's right, drink up.

     David takes the pills.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Now go back to sleep so you'll
               be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the
               morning.

                         DAVID
               What time is it?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               It's nearly eight.  I'm off
               duty shortly, then I'm off to
               the films with Alex.

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Miss Price, the other nurse
               that attended you.

                         DAVID
               What are you going to see?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               An American film about the
               Mafia called `See You Next
               Wednesday', and I want to see
               it badly, so you give me no
               problems and go to sleep.

                         DAVID
                    (dropping off)
               Do you have bad dreams, too?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Some, everyone does.

                         DAVID
               Yes, but does everyone kill
               Bambi?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Bambi?

     David has fallen asleep.  Miss Gallagher turns off the
     light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Kill Bambi?

     She exits, closing the door plunging the room into
     darkness.

18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY

     The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys
     about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing
     appropriate background actions.  Behind the Nurses'
     Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,
     obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with
     different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from
     the drug cabinet.  She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Take these round now, will you
               please?  The American boy in
               twenty-one is only to have
               these after he's eaten.  Will
               you be sure of that?

                         ALEX
               Has he been refusing food?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Nothing quite as dramatic as
               that, Miss Price.  He just
               doesn't eat enough of what is
               put before him.  He suffers
               from nightmares.  I'd think he
               just needs a hand to hold.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way
     down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her
     appearance.  She enters.

19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY

     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.
     She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.

                         ALEX
               Hello, Benjamin.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Well, all right then, be that
               way.  Here, swallow this.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.
     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin
     who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,
     handing Alex back the glass.

                         ALEX
               Feeling better?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               The doctor will be round
               later.  Would you like a
               picture book to look at?  We
               have some lovely funny Beanos.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black
     Jamaican ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into
     Benjamin's ward.

20   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

                         ALEX
               Has the patient in twenty-one
               gotten his tray yet?

                         ORDERLY
               The American?  Yes, duck.

                         ALEX
               How did he look?

                         ORDERLY
               What do you mean, `how did he
               look'?

                         ALEX
               You know, did he seem
               depressed?  Do you think he'll
               eat the food?

                         ORDERLY
                    (annoyed)
               I'm an orderly, not a bleeding
               psychiatrist!  I push things
               about, but I've little say
               what happens to them.

                         ALEX
               Thank you.

     Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room.
     She hesitates, then peeks in.

21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits
     patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is
     apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               Mr. Kessler?

                         DAVID
                    (lifeless)
               Yes?

                         ALEX
               You haven't eaten your lunch.

                         DAVID
               I'm not very hungry, thank
               you.

                         ALEX
               I'm afraid you have to eat
               something.

                         DAVID
               Please, really.  I'm not
               hungry.

                         ALEX
               You put me in an awkward
               position, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
               How is that?

                         ALEX
                    (she shakes the paper cup)
               Well, you're to take these
               after you've eaten.  Now what
               kind of nurse would I be if I
               failed in so simple a task as
               giving out some pills?

                         DAVID
               Leave the pills.  I'll take
               them later.

                         ALEX
               Sorry.

     She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Miss Price!

                         ALEX
               Call me Alex.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Alex!

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               Mr. Kessler?

     David is getting interested.

                         DAVID
               Call me David.

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               David?

                         DAVID
               This is absurd.  I'm not
               hungry.  I don't want any
               food.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in
     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David
     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under
     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.

                         ALEX
               Let's try a little harder,
               shall we?

                         DAVID
               Will you give me a break?

     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused
     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds
     up another bite.

                         ALEX
               Will I have to take such
               drastic action again, David?

     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.
     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
     other up.  Finally:

                         DAVID
               May I have a glass of milk?

     Alex smiles.

FADE OUT

     FADE IN

22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again we are running fast and faster.  David again
     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He
     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:

                         JACK (O.S.)
               David!  David!  Please help
               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my
               God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
     screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-
     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There
     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same
     as David's.

     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed
     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the
     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches
     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the
     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches
     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The
     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
     His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale
     white with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in
     the....

                                                  CUT TO:

23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls
     out....

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!

     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly, go at once to twenty-
               one and restrain the patient.

     The orderly exits.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Gallagher, remain here at
               the desk.  I'll be in twenty-
               one.

     She exits.

24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes
     thoughtfully out the window.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've never had bad dreams
               before?

                         DAVID
                    (upset)
               Sure, as a kid.  But never so
               real.  Never so bizarre.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did you get a good look at the
               man who attacked you?

                         DAVID
               I've told you, it wasn't a
               man.  It was an animal.  A big
               wolf or something.  A rabid
               dog.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (chewing on his glasses)
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've
               been traumatized, but Jack was
               torn apart.  I saw him.  A man
               can't do that to someone with
               his bare hands.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You'd be surprised what
               horrors a man is capable of.

                         DAVID
               Did you see Jack?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               No.  In fact, your wounds were
               cleaned and dressed before you
               arrived here.

                         DAVID
               Did you talk to the police in
               East Proctor?  Did the cops go
               to The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I really don't know.

                         DAVID
               Then why the hell are you so
               quick to disbelieve me?  You
               yourself said it must have
               taken incredible strength to
               tear apart a person like that.
                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (rubs his forehead)
               David, please.  The police are
               satisfied.  I'm certain that
               if a monster were out roaming
               northern England we'd have
               seen it on the telly.

                         DAVID
               You really think I'm crazy,
               don't you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Believe me.  The Hound of the
               Baskervilles was an invention
               of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.
               And if you'd read the bloody
               book, you'd find that Holmes
               discovered your house of hell
               a fraud, a fake.

     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.
     Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now really, David.  You're far
               too intelligent to go on this
               way.  When you return to
               America I want you to seek out
               a competent psychiatrist or
               psychologist or something and
               stop this nonsense.  You'll be
               leaving this hospital in three
               or four days, please remain
               sane.  At least until you are
               no longer our responsibility.

     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.

                         DAVID
               Dr. Hirsch?
                    (pause)
               I'd rather not be by myself.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Of course not, David.  I'll
               fetch in young Miss Price.

25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and
     she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.
     The room is dark except for the lamp by which she
     reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King
     Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex
     reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.
     She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and
     feet, fingers and toes stretch.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               You're a very beautiful girl.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               I thought you were asleep.

                         DAVID
               I was.  What are you reading?

                         ALEX
               `A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

                         DAVID
               Do you like it?

                         ALEX
               I've just started it.  My
               friend gave it to me.

     They look at each other.

                         ALEX
               What do you dream about?

                         DAVID
               I dream of death mostly.

                         ALEX
               I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have
               asked you.

                         DAVID
               It's okay.  I want to talk to
               you.

     They sit and look at each other for a while longer.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               That's not really a very
               proper question.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               Twenty-eight.

                         DAVID
               I'm twenty-seven.

                         ALEX
               I know.

                         DAVID
               Now what do you want to talk
               about?

                         ALEX
               Was Jack Goodman your good
               friend?

                         DAVID
                    (seriously)
               My best friend.  My very best
               friend.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               Shall I read to you?

                         DAVID
               What?  Oh, yes, please.

                         ALEX
                    (opens book)
               A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court by Samuel L.
               Clemens.  This is after the
               preface but before chapter
               one: A Word of Explanation.
               You all right?

                         DAVID
                    (settles back)
               Yes, go on.

                         ALEX
                    (clears her throat)
               Ahem, A Word of Explanation.
               It was in Warwick Castle that
               I came across the curious
               stranger whom I am going to
               talk about.  He attracted me
               by three things: his candid
               simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient
               armor, and the restfulness of
               his company - for he did all
               the talking.  We fell together
               as modest people will in the
               tail of the herd....

26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT

     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His
     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
     television.  We can see past the small dining nook
     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful
     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and
     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.

                         FATHER
               I'll get it.

     The pounding continues.

                         FATHER
               All right, all right!  Hold
               your horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he
     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence
     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the
     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in
     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into
     his chair by one of the things and held there.

                         DAVID
               Stop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
     slits David's throat.

                                                  CUT TO:

27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee
     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to
     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides
     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and
     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David
     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up
     anyway.

                         ALEX
                    (yawns, smiles)
               Hello.  You all right?

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry I woke you up.

                         ALEX
               Don't be silly.  Can I get you
               something?

                         DAVID
               No, thank you.  Just keep me
               company for a while.

                         ALEX
               That's easy enough.

                         DAVID
               I keep having these really
               terrible dreams.  They are
               getting worse and I can't seem
               to stop them.

                         ALEX
               David, your dreams will stop.
               You'll leave England and your
               bad memories; and then this
               will all fade away.

                         DAVID
               Will you come with me?

                         ALEX
                    (taken aback)
               What?

                         DAVID
                    (smiling)
               I'm serious.  You don't know
               me and I know nothing about
               you.  We have a perfect
               relationship.

                         ALEX
               Now, David, I said I would
               keep you company, but I meant
               right here and now.

                         DAVID
               Will you think about it?

                         ALEX
               How did we get from your bad
               dreams to my taking a holiday
               with a patient?

                         DAVID
                    (big grin)
               Not just a patient -- me.

                         ALEX
               You're being awfully forward,
               aren't you?

                         DAVID
               Forgive me, I'm trying to
               cheer myself up and an affair
               with a beautiful nurse seemed
               like just the thing to do it.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               All I am to you is a sex
               fantasy then?

                         DAVID
               Now I'm embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Good.  I thought for a moment
               I was the only embarrassed one
               in the room.

     There is an awkward pause.

                         DAVID
               Where were we in the book?

     Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.

                         ALEX
                    (looking through
                     the book)
               Let me see here.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast
     tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the
     bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.

                         ORDERLY
               Ah you're up.  Good morning
               and a good day to you.  We've
               quite a meal for you here this
               morning.  Bacon, oatmeal,
               orange juice, and toast with
               jam.  Good stuff there.  Now
               eat it up and I'll be back for
               the dishes when you've
               finished.

     The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been
     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,
     notices his exit.

                         DAVID
               Good morning.

     He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a
     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.

                         DAVID
                    (in mock English accent)
               Please, sir, I want some more.

     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his
     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear
     Jack's o.s. voice.

                         JACK (O.S.)
               Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving
     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him
     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud
     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his
     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he
     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome
     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
     at all.

                         JACK
                    (pleasantly)
               Nice to see you.

                         DAVID
                    (unbelieving)
               Get the fuck out of here,
               Jack.

                         JACK
               Thanks a lot.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               This is too much.  I can't
               handle this.

                         JACK
               I'm aware that I don't look so
               great, but I thought you'd be
               glad to see me.

     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat
     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at
     Jack horrified.

                         JACK
               David!  You're hurting my
               feelings.

                         DAVID
                    (astounded)
               Hurting your feelings?  Has it
               occurred to you that it may be
               unsettling to have you rise
               from your grave to visit me?
               Listen to me, I'm talking to a
               hamburger!

                         JACK
               I'm sorry to be upsetting you,
               David, but I had to come.

                         DAVID
                    (aghast)
               Aren't you supposed to be
               buried in New York someplace?

                         JACK
               Yeah.  Your parents came to my
               funeral.  I was surprised at
               how many people came.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Why should you be surprised?
               You were a very well-liked
               person.

                         JACK
               Debbie Klein cried a lot.

                         DAVID
               I can't stand it.

                         JACK
               So you know what she does?
               She's so grief stricken she
               runs to find solace in Rudy
               Levine's bed.

                         DAVID
               Rudy Levine the shmuck?

                         JACK
               Life mocks me even in death.

     Jack takes another bite of toast.

                         DAVID
                    (to himself)
               I'm going completely crazy.

                         JACK
                    (loud)
               David!

                         DAVID
                    (louder)
               What?!

                         JACK
               David, now I know this may be
               hard for you, but I have to
               warn you.

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Warn me?  Will you get out of
               here, you meat loaf?

                         JACK
               I'm a grisly sight, it's true;
               but I love you and that's why
               I'm here.  You've got to know.

                         DAVID
               If you love me so much, Jack,
               you'll realize how
               disconcerting it is to share
               one's breakfast with the
               living dead!

                         JACK
               We were attacked by a
               werewolf.

                         DAVID
                    (covers his ears)
               I'm not listening!

                         JACK
               On the moors, we were attacked
               by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

                         DAVID
               Shut up, you zombie!

                         JACK
               I was murdered, an unnatural
               death, and now I walk the
               earth in limbo until the
               werewolf's curse is lifted.

                         DAVID
                    (incredulous, furious)
               What's wrong with you?  Shut
               up!

                         JACK
               The wolf's bloodline must be
               severed.  The last remaining
               werewolf must be destroyed.

                         DAVID
               Will you be quiet?!

     Jack rises and comes closer to David.

                         JACK
               It's you, David.

                         DAVID
               What?!

                         JACK
               You survived and now you shall
               continue the curse.

                         DAVID
               What are you talking about?  I
               won't accept this!  Get out!
               God damit!

                         JACK
               Remember what that guy at The
               Slaughtered Lamb said?
               `Beware the moon.'

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Stop it, Jack.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon.  The full
               moon, David.  You've got two
               days.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Jack, please go away.  Please
               go away.

                         JACK
               You'll stalk the streets of
               London a creature of the
               night.

                         DAVID
                    (flares up)
               You're talking like Boris
               Karloff!  It's movie dialogue!

                         JACK
               David, please believe me.  You
               will kill people, David.
               You've got to stop the
               bloodshed before it begins.

                         DAVID
                    (yells)
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               Listen to me!  Take your own
               life, David.  It's our only
               chance.

                         DAVID
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               The supernatural!  The powers
               of darkness!  It's all true.
               Take your own life!  Suicide,
               David.  Join me.

                         DAVID
                    (losing it)
               Nurse!  Oh God!  Alex!

                         JACK
               It's cold, David, and I'm so
               alone.  The undead surround
               me.  Have you ever talked to a
               corpse?  It's boring!  I'm
               lonely!  Kill yourself, David,
               before you kill others.

29   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - DAY

     Alex rushing down the hospital corridor.

30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David rocking back and forth weeping.

                         JACK
               Don't cry, David.

31   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing down hospital corridor.

32   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

                         JACK
               Please don't cry.

33   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing to the door.

34   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - CLOSEUP

                         JACK
                    (softly in looming
                     closeup)
               Beware the moon, David.

                                                  CUT TO:

     ALEX

     as she bursts into the room.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
     He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits
     on the bed and hugs David.

                         ALEX
               David?  David!

     David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly
     until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe
     easier.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?

     David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               I'm a werewolf.

                         ALEX
               A werewolf?

     Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is
     and backs off a little.  David composes himself.

                         ALEX
               Are you better now?

                         DAVID
               I'll let you know the next
               full moon.

                         ALEX
               You're to be discharged
               tomorrow.  Will you be all
               right?

     David takes Alex's hand.

                         DAVID
               My friend Jack was just here.

                         ALEX
               Your dead friend Jack?

                         DAVID
               Yeah.  He says that I will
               become a monster in two days.
               What do you think?

                         ALEX
               What do I think?  You mean
               about the possibility of your
               becoming a monster in two days
               or about visits from dead
               friends?

                         DAVID
               I was dreaming again?

                         ALEX
               I would think so.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Yeah, I would think so, too.

     Alex considers for a while, finally....

                         ALEX
               Do you have a place to stay in
               London?


                                                  CUT TO:

35   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     David and Alex walking down the street.  Alex points
     out her flat and leads David up the front steps.  She
     gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door.

36   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex enters and David follows.  A small, utilitarian
     apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light.  David puts
     his backpack on the floor.
                         ALEX
               The kitchen.

                         DAVID
               Very nice.

     She proceeds to give the tour.

                         ALEX
               Closet.

                         DAVID
               Charming.

                         ALEX
               Bathroom.

                         DAVID
               Lovely.

                         ALEX
               The bedroom.

                         DAVID
               There is only one bed.

                         ALEX
                    (makes a face)
               David, perhaps you'd like to
               watch the telly while I take a
               shower.

     Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking
     on his heels.

37   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream
     of water in the shower.

                         DAVID
               It's nice to see you.

                         ALEX
               It's nice to see you.

     MONTAGE IN SHOWER - DAY

     A sequence of soap and flesh.  Van Morrison's
     "Moondance" plays.  A montage of soapy hands on
     slippery skin.  Thighs rubbing thighs, arms and
     shoulders.  David and Alex kiss again and again and....

38   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY

     David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's
     bed.  David pulls out and they lay holding each other.
     After a moment....

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Yes?

                         DAVID
               Will you be here in about
               fifteen minutes?

                         ALEX
               Of course.

                         DAVID
                    (leers)
               Good.

     Alex props herself up on one elbow.

                         ALEX
               David, you don't honestly
               believe that in reality your
               friend Jack rose from the
               grave to breakfast with you?
               Do you really?

                         DAVID
               I was awake and he was in my
               room.

                         ALEX
               But, David.

                         DAVID
                    (firm)
               I wasn't hallucinating.

     Pause.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Tomorrow is the full moon.

                         DAVID
               That's good, Alex.  Reassure
               me.

     Alex begins kissing David's neck.

                         DAVID
               It's all right, I know I'm
               being insane.

     She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.

                         DAVID
               Okay, okay.  I'm properly
               reassured!

     Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually
     lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to
     hold onto the headboard of the bed.

                         DAVID
                    (closing his eyes)
               This is very reassuring.  I'm
               feeling very reassured.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

     INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts
     her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes
     out of the room and goes to the bathroom.

39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces,
     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When
     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine
     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes
     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big
     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in
     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing
     in the doorway.

                         DAVID
                    (points a trembling
                     finger)
               You're not real.

                         JACK
               Don't be an asshole, David.
               Come here.

     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living
     room.

40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM

     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He
     does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not
     to wake up Alex.

                         DAVID
               What are you doing here?

                         JACK
               I wanted to see you.

                         DAVID
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now go
               away.

                         JACK
               David, I'm sorry I upset you
               yesterday, but you must
               understand what is going on.

                         DAVID
               I understand all right.
               You're one of the undead and
               I'm a werewolf.

                         JACK
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Get out of here, Jack!

                         JACK
               David, tomorrow night is the
               full moon.  You'll change,
               you'll become....

                         DAVID
                    (interrupting)
               A monster.  I know, I know.

                         JACK
               You must take your own life
               now, David, before it's too
               late.

                         DAVID
               Jack, are you really dead?

                         JACK
               What do you think?

                         DAVID
               I think I've lost my mind.  I
               think you're not real.  I
               think I'm asleep and you're a
               part of another bad dream.

                         JACK
               You must believe me.

                         DAVID
               What, Jack?  That tomorrow
               night beneath the full moon
               I'll sprout hair and fangs and
               eat people?  Bullshit!

                         JACK
               The canines will be real.
               You'll taste real blood!  God
               damit, David, please believe
               me!  You'll kill and make
               others like me!  I'm not
               having a nice time, David!
               Don't allow this to happen
               again!  You must take your own
               life!

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               I will not accept this!  Now
               go away!

41   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex wakes up from the shouting.

                         ALEX
               David?

42   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                         JACK
                    (quietly)
               This is not pretend, David.

                         DAVID
                    (righteous)
               I will not be threatened by a
               walking meat loaf!

     Alex enters the room.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?  I heard
               voices.

     David turns and sees that Jack is gone.

                         DAVID
                    (triumphant)
               It was just me, Alex.  It was
               just me.


43   EXT. EAST PROCTOR - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is driving down the main street in his red
     M.G.  He parks in front of The Slaughtered Lamb.

44   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - DAY

     The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
     The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the
     Chess Player is still at the chessboard.  Dr. Hirsch
     enters and crosses to the bar.  As he removes his
     gloves:

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A drink for a very cold man?

     The Woman comes in from the back.

                         WOMAN
               Hello, there.  What can I get
               you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Campari and soda would do
               nicely.

                         WOMAN
               Sorry, love.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I suppose Guinness will
               suffice.

     She serves him his beer.  As he lays down his money...

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A thousand thanks.

     After a few sips.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nasty bit of business with
               those two young American boys.

     The Dart Player stops his wiping.

                         DART PLAYER
               I'm afraid I don't know what
               you mean, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, I'm sure that's right.  A
               few weeks ago, the last full
               moon wasn't it?

     The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look
     at Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I mean that escaped lunatic.
               The one that killed the boy.
               Wasn't that near here?

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (concerned)
               And where are you from, sir?

     Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his
     table.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               London.  Knight takes pawn.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               What?

     Sees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game....

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, yes, yes.

     Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What's that?

                         WOMAN
                    (nervously)
               Oh, that's been there for two
               hundred years.  We were going
               to paint it out, but it's
               traditional, so we left it.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I see.  You've heard nothing
               about the incident?

                         DART PLAYER
               Incident?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The murder?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Are you a police officer?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (smiles)
               No, no, hardly.  I work in the
               hospital where the Kessler boy
               was brought.

     The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He was talking about
               werewolves and monsters and as
               I was near here I thought....

                         DART PLAYER
               You thought what?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I thought I'd look into the
               boy's story.

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (scoffs)
               A story about werewolves - now
               really, sir.

     Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Would you like a game of
               chess?

45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door.
     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has
     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously
     not going out.  Alex pulls away.

                         ALEX
               Let me go now, you'll make me
               late.

                         DAVID
               Do me an enormous favor?

                         ALEX
               Anything.

                         DAVID
               Tell me that it's silly of me
               to be apprehensive.

                         ALEX
               It's silly of you to be
               apprehensive.

                         DAVID
               Werewolves simply do not
               exist.

                         ALEX
                    (serious)
               David, do you want me to stay
               here tonight?

                         DAVID
               Yeah, I do, but go to work.

     He opens the door and they both go outside.

46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND
     DAVID

     walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.

                         ALEX
               Listen, if you get too
               anxious, call me at the
               hospital, okay?

                         DAVID
               Okay.

                         ALEX
               I've left those pills for you.

                         DAVID
               A doper werewolf.

     They kiss again.
                         ALEX
               I'm off.  There's food in the
               fridge.

                         DAVID
               See you later.

     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands
     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
     and snarl.

                         DAVID
                    (to dog)
               What did I do?

     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
     tugging on his leash.

                         DAVID
               Thanks a lot, dog.

     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
     up the steps to find the door locked.

                         DAVID
               Wonderful.

     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He
     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.

                         DAVID
               An American werewolf was found
               frozen to death today in the
               heart of London, England.

     He looks around and sees that there is a small window
     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.

     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back
     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is
     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.

                         DAVID
               What did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to
     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David
     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull
     himself into the window.

47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK

     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.

                         DAVID
                    (weakly)
               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.

48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He
     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.

49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

     He lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring
     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
     kitchen.

50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     He reopens the fridge.

                         DAVID
               I'm not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.

51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

     David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer
     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David
     switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
     and humming.

                         DAVID
                    (singing)
               `Moon River, wider than a mile
               I'm crossing you in style,
               Someday....'

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,
     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back
     inside and we note that the front door is not
     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and
     looks into the mirror.

                         DAVID
               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the
               blood of an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and
     round the room like a caged animal.

52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT

     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.

                         ALEX
               How are we feeling tonight?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No!

                         ALEX
                    (smiling)
               Benjamin, have you ever been
               severely beaten about the face
               and neck?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               I thought not.

     She tucks him in.

                         ALEX
               You sleep now and have sweet
               dreams.

                         BENJAMIN & ALEX
               No!

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him
     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
     the window.

53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT

     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.

                         DAVID
               Jesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (screams)
               What?  Christ!  What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
     his head.  He trembles violently.

                         DAVID
               I'm burning up!  Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is
     dripping wet.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts out in
                     pain and fear)
               Jack!?  Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.

                         DAVID
               Help me!  Somebody help me,
               please!  Jack!!

     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at
     his legs.

                         DAVID
                    (pleading, whimpering)
               I'm sorry I called you a meat
               loaf, Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
     burning him.
     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
     for air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives
     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
     to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see
     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth
     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his
     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
     claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into
     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the
     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the
     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
     Wolf padding off into the darkness.


54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An
     attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver
     and the cab drives off.

                         WOMAN
               Which one, Harry?

                         MAN
               Number thirty-nine, but let's
               go `round the back.

                         WOMAN
               Why?

                         MAN
               Come on, we'll give Sean a
               scare.

                         WOMAN
               You're crazy, Harry.

                         HARRY
               Come on.

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of
     the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the
     two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and
     quiet.

55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear something?

                         HARRY
               Just now?

                         WOMAN
               Yes.

                         HARRY
               No.  Here we are, Sean's is
               the one....

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  Before the Woman can scream, the
     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't
     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.

56   INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHT

     Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out
     onto the park - a middle-aged couple.

                         WIFE
               Sean, those hooligans are in
               the park again.

                         SEAN
               Aren't you ready yet?  They'll
               be here any minute.

                         WIFE
               Something's going on out
               there.

57   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense
     medication into paper cups when Dr. Hirsch approaches.
     He is still wearing his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is Miss Price on duty this
               evening?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Yes, Doctor.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, do you know if
               Miss Price has seen the
               Kessler boy since his release?

     Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Uh, I don't know if....

     Alex has walked up and overheard the last.

               It's all right, Susan.  Yes,
               Doctor, I have.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come to my office, Miss Price.

     Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently
     follows Dr. Hirsch down the hallway.

58   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his
     wife's complaints.  She hangs by the door.  He walks
     deeper into the park.

                         SEAN
                    (calls out)
               Is anyone there?

59   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Sit down, Alex.

     Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I was in East Proctor today.

     Alex looks confused.  Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of
     her concern.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh dear girl, your
               extracurricular activities are
               of no consequence to me.  I
               don't give a damn who you
               sleep with.  I'm concerned
               about David.

                         ALEX
               Yes, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's a full moon.  Where is
               he?

                         ALEX
               At my flat.  I'm off at
               midnight and....

     Dr. Hirsch picks up the phone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The number, Alex.  Your
               number!

60   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean carefully approaches something near the trees.  He
     steps on something and looks down to see what it is.
     It is an arm.

61   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - THE
     TELEPHONE

     rings loudly.  (This is a scare.)  It continues to ring
     unanswered.

62   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He's not there.

     Alex grows worried.

                         ALEX
               He's not?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, has David persisted in
               his werewolf fantasies?

                         ALEX
               Well, yes, but he seems to be
               more upset by the death of his
               friend.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Has his friend appeared to him
               again?

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What did he say?

                         ALEX
               David says Jack comes to warn
               him.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Warn him?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is
               this more serious than I know?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I tried to investigate the
               attack.  There are no records.
               The case was closed and now
               they've `misplaced' the file.
               David's lacerations were
               cleaned and dressed when he
               arrived here and yet
               supposedly no doctor examined
               him before I did.  The Goodman
               boy is already in the ground
               so he's no good to us.  So I
               went to the pub in East
               Proctor where I was convinced
               of two things.

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               They were lying.  There were
               no witnesses, no escaped
               lunatic.  The whole community
               is hiding the truth of what
               actually happened up there.

                         ALEX
               And what else?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I think the village of East
               Proctor is hiding some dark
               and terrible secret.  I'm
               convinced that, like David,
               they believe in this werewolf.

     Alex is flabbergasted.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've absolutely no idea
               where David might be?

                         ALEX
               No.  He knows no one in
               London, besides me.  I
               shouldn't have left him alone.

     Suddenly.

                         ALEX
               Surely you're not
               suggesting....

                         DR. HIRSCH
               David has suffered a severe
               trauma.  I myself witnessed
               some form of mass neurosis in
               East Proctor.  If all the
               villagers believe that Jack
               Goodman was killed by a
               werewolf, why shouldn't David?
               And then it follows that if he
               survived an attack by a
               werewolf, wouldn't he himself
               become a werewolf the next
               full moon?

                         ALEX
                    (bewildered)
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, I don't mean running about
               on all fours and howling at
               the moon.  But in such a
               deranged state he could harm
               himself, or perhaps others.

                         ALEX
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Let's call the police and see
               if they can help us find our
               wandering boy.


63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT

     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London
     are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old
     DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to
     keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its
     ears perk up and he growls in warning.

                         DERELICT #1
               Old Winston smells something.

                         DERELICT #2
                    (calls out)
               Who's there?

     The dog begins to whine.

                         DERELICT #2
               Let `im go.

     Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in
     terror.

                         DERELICT #3
               Brave dog that.

                         DERELICT #1
                    (worried)
               Here - who's there?

     An unearthly howl shatters the night.  We've heard this
     sound on the moors.

                         DERELICT #2
               That's not Winston.

                         DERELICT #3
               Look there.

     He points out into the night.  They strain their eyes -
     something is approaching them.  They can just make out
     its size.

                         DERELICT #1
               Mother Mary of God.

64   INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

     A train SCREECHES to a halt.  (A scare.)  We are in the
     tubes of London.  Only one passenger disembarks and the
     train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous
     hallways.  The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-
     dressed.  He looks about the platform, then at his
     watch.  He walks up to a vending machine to buy a
     Cadbury Chocolate Bar.

     The camera is on ground level and as we watch the
     Passenger, the Wolf's legs flash by us.

     CLOSEUP

     of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar.  He turns
     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.
     Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one
     of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's
     tubes.  He feels he's being followed and turns slowly
     to look.  There is no one and he continues, concerned
     about his imagination.

     Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses,
     then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving
     stairway.

     In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and
     black tongue.  It waits, panting, drool falls from its
     mouth.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly
     down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street
     Level".  He is being followed.  He hears it and we hear
     it.  He stops, frightened.

                         PASSENGER
               Hello?

     THE PASSENGER

                         PASSENGER
               Is there someone there?

     We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing.  The Passenger is
     beginning to panic.

                         PASSENGER
               I can assure you that this is
               not in the least bit amusing!

     He looks around wildly.

                         PASSENGER
               I shall report this!

     PASSENGER'S P.O.V.

     We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the
     tunnel towards us.

                         PASSENGER
               Good Lord.

     THE PASSENGER

     turns to flee, his jog becoming a run.  He is
     terrified.

     WOLF - CLOSEUP

     of the Wolf's running steps.

     THE PASSENGER

     frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying
     his nose.  He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear.
     Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving
     stairs, falling several times.  He sits, panting and
     defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.

65   CLOSEUP - A TIGER ROARING

     (A scare.)  The tiger paces in its cage and roars
     again.  We are at:

     EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     It is early morning and all the animals are aroused.
     We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and
     panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage
     where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground
     by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is
     completely naked, his body dirty, with several
     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and
     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
     something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices
     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean
     them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel
     discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his
     eyes.

                         DAVID
               Wake me up, Alex.

     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
     He stands up and looks around.

     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle
     about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his
     lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all
     concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a
     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.
     He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching
     himself on a thorn.

                         DAVID
               Ouch!

66   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying
     to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The
     phone rings and she runs for it.

                    (excited, then
                     disappointed)
               Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he
               hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I
               will, doctor, but I just feel
               so helpless sitting here doing
               nothing.  Thank you, yes,
               goodbye.

     She hangs up and looks around the empty flat.  She is
     now more worried than ever.

67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     David is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if
     the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the
     bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.

               Hello.

     CLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING

     A LITTLE BOY with four helium balloons on a string is
     staring intently at the gorilla.  The Little Boy leaves
     the monkey house and we travel with him as he looks at
     several other animals.  Eventually he comes to the Wolf
     cage.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Pssst!

     The Little Boy looks around.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Hey, kid!  Pssst.  Little boy
               with the balloons.

     The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me?"

               Come over here.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush replies:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               If you come over here, I'll
               give you a pound.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush pleads.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Two pounds?

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush reasons:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Listen, two pounds is a lot of
               money.  It's almost five
               dollars.

                         LITTLE BOY
                    (very English)
               I don't know who you are.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               I'm the famous balloon thief.

                         LITTLE BOY
               Why would a thief want to give
               me two pounds?

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (losing patience)
               Come here and I'll show you.

     The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery,
     but stops a few feet away.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (pleading)
               Come on!

     The Little Boy edges forward.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               A little closer.

     When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his
     balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.

                         DAVID
               Thank you.

     David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his
     balloons, startling several animal lovers.

68   EXT. PARK - DAY

     An ELDERLY COUPLE sits feeding birds, their coats
     folded nearly over the park bench.  A naked blur darts
     by, grabbing the top coat as it passes, scaring off the
     birds.

                         MOTHER
               What?

                         LITTLE BOY
               A naked, American man -- the
               famous balloon thief.

70   EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     The signs they always have on London newsstands
     proclaim "Man or Monster?"  Dr. Hirsch picks up a
     newspaper with its headline, "London Murder Victims
     Found Partially Devoured".

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I'll have one of those, too.

     He pays for the papers.  The second one's headline,
     "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?"

71   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY - BUS STOP

     in another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of
     fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the
     bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to
     floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the
     crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and
     the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high
     heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a
     conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David
     clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar
     trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks
     at him oddly.

                         DAVID
                    (cheerfully)
               A lot of weather we've been
               having lately.

     The man studies David carefully.

72   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading.
     There is loud knocking on the door.  Alex rushes to
     open it and David enters quickly, closing the door
     behind him.  He is still wearing the woman's coat.

                         ALEX
               David!  Where on earth have
               you been!?!

                         DAVID
               I'm freezing.

     He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and
     gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is
     excited, even euphoric.

                         DAVID
               Alex, I've lost my mind.  I
               woke up at the zoo!  But you
               know what?  I feel terrific!

                         ALEX
               The zoo?

                         DAVID
               Waking up at the zoo, that's
               not so insane.  Having no
               clothes on?  That's insane.
               What did I do last night,
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Don't you remember?

                         DAVID
               I said goodbye to you.  I was
               locked out of the flat.  I
               climbed the wall and came in
               through the bathroom window.
               I started to read and then I
               was naked at the zoo!
                    (big smile)
               I guess I am out of my fucking
               mind.

     Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his
     shoulders.

                         ALEX
               I worried about you.  We
               didn't know where you were.

     David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back
     with equal passion.

                         ALEX
               Where did you get that coat?

     David laughs.

73   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE

     Dr. Hirsch is dialing the phone.

74   INT. ALEX'S FLAT

     The phone rings.

                         ALEX
               I'll get it.

     Alex goes to the phone.

                         ALEX
               Hello?

     The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and
     Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, have you heard anything?

     Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her.
                         ALEX
               He's here.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (excited)
               Is he all right?  Why didn't
               you call me?  Where was he?

                         ALEX
               He doesn't remember.  He woke
               up at the zoo.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The zoo?  Is he rational?

                         ALEX
               Yes, he is.  He's very excited
               and confused, but he's not
               crazy, if that's what you
               mean.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Have you read the papers
               today?  Have you listened to
               the radio or television?

                         ALEX
               No, why?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is David acting strangely?

                         ALEX
               No, not really.

     Dr. Hirsch considers.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Could you get here without any
               trouble?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think so.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Right.  Now listen carefully.
               I want you to bring David
               here.  I want him in my care.
               I'll notify the police that
               we've found him.  It is
               imperative that you bring him
               straight to the hospital.  Do
               you understand?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're certain he's lucid?
               You won't need any help?

                         ALEX
               He's fine.  We'll come right
               over.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Shall I send a car?

                         ALEX
               No, a cab will be faster.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I expect you shortly.

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then
     dials again.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Scotland Yard?


75   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     Alex and David are walking.

                         ALEX
               The next corner we can get a
               cab.

                         DAVID
                    (grins)
               I should be committed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch will know what to
               do.

                         DAVID
                    (stretches)
               I don't know why I feel so
               good.  I haven't felt this
               good in a long time.

     Alex is signaling for a taxi.

                         DAVID
               My body feels alive, alert.  I
               feel like an athlete.

     A taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door.

                         ALEX
               Get in.

76   INT. TAXI - DAY

                         ALEX
               Saint Martin's Hospital.

                         DRIVER
               Right.

     As they drive.

                         DRIVER
               It's like the days of the Mad
               Barber of Fleet Street, isn't
               it?

                         ALEX
               I beg your pardon?

                         DRIVER
               The murders.

                         DAVID
                    (concerned)
               What murders?

                         DRIVER
               Last night.  Haven't you
               heard?  Six people in
               different parts of the city
               mutilated.  A real maniac this
               one.

                         DAVID
               Pull over.

                         ALEX
               But....

                         DAVID
                    (adamant)
               Pull over.

77   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     The cab pulls to the sidewalk.

                         DAVID
               Pay the man.

     David gets out of the cab.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off
     after David.

                         ALEX
               David, what are you doing?

                         DAVID
               Six people mutilated?  It had
               to be me, Alex.

                         ALEX
               David, stop!

     He turns and faces her.

                         DAVID
               I am going to the cops.
               There's a full moon tonight.
               Jack was right.  I....

                         ALEX
                    (angry)
               Jack is dead!

                         DAVID
               Jack is dead.  Look, six
               people have been killed.  I'm
               going to the police.

     David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex
     has to jog to keep up with him.

                         ALEX
               David, please be rational.
               Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

                         DAVID
               Rational!?!  I'm a fucking
               werewolf, for Christ's sake!

     He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.

                         DAVID
               Officer, I killed those people
               last night.

                         BOBBIE
                    (interested)
               You did, did you?

     Alex runs up.

                         ALEX
               He's playing a stupid joke,
               sir.

                         DAVID
                    (dumbfounded)
               What?

                         ALEX
               We had an argument.  He's
               being silly.

                         DAVID
                    (desperate)
               I swear, I don't know this
               girl.

                         BOBBIE
               All right, you two, move
               along.

                         DAVID
               Hey, you asshole!  I want you
               to arrest me!

                         BOBBIE
               There's no call for that kind
               of language.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               Queen Elizabeth is a man!
               Prince Charles is a faggot!
               Winston Churchill was full of
               shit!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing patience)
               Now see here young man.

                         DAVID
               Shakespeare was French!  The
               Queen Mother sucks cocks in
               hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss!

     The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians
     start to gather.

                         BOBBIE
               That's quite enough!

                         ALEX
                    (pleading)
               David, please!

                         DAVID
               Who is this girl?

                         BOBBIE
               You're going to have to stop
               this disturbance or I shall
               arrest you.

                         DAVID
                    (frustrated, yelling)
               That's what I want you to do,
               you moron!

                         ALEX
                    (to Bobbie)
               Sir, he's very upset.  His
               friend was killed and....

                         DAVID
               Will you shut up!?!!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing his temper)
               That's enough!  Now go about
               your business.

                         ALEX
               Yes, David, let's go.

                         DAVID
                    (disbelief)
               You're not going to arrest me?

     David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.

                         DAVID
               Don't you think he should
               arrest me?
                         ONLOOKER
               Well, I'm not sure.  How does
               he know this isn't a prank?

                         DAVID
                    (despair)
               A prank?

                         ALEX
                    (urgently)
               David....

     The Bobbie has lost all patience.

                         BOBBIE
               I've no time for this
               foolishness.
                    (to onlookers)
               Nothing to look at.  Move
               along.

     The Bobbie walks away.  David is beside himself.

                         DAVID
               Hopeless.  It's hopeless.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               David, let's go now.

     David turns in a rage.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone, dammit!  You
               people are crazy!  I've got to
               get away from here!  I've got
               to do something!

                         ALEX
                    (worried)
               David, don't lose control.

                         DAVID
                    (approaching, hysteria)
               Control!?!  What control!?!
               Get away from me!

     He begins to cry.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone!

     He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their
     brakes, just missing him.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     It's too late.  He's lost in traffic.  Alex stands for
     a moment not knowing which way to turn.

78   EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     David is running in panic.  He finally comes to rest in
     an alley.  He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.

79   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk.
     Dr. Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               The forensic lads seem to feel
               that some sort of animal was
               involved, that's true, but I
               hardly think....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               Regardless of what you think,
               Lieutenant, the fact remains
               that David is missing and that
               we must find him.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Before nightfall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Precisely.

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (harried)
               Gentlemen, please.  We shall
               find Mr. Kessler as quickly as
               we're able.

                         ALEX
               He tried to have himself
               arrested.  He....

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (interrupts)
               Getting arrested isn't all
               that difficult, Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               He wants help.  He....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               What can we do to assist you?

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (rising)
               Stay here.  If we need you,
               we'll know where to reach you.

     He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               I cannot accept a connection
               between David Kessler and last
               night's murders.  We will find
               him, however.  I can assure
               you of that.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We'll find him, not to worry.

     The two policemen exit.  Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex.

                         ALEX
                    (distraught)
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (comforting)
               Tea would be nice.

80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY

     David is in a telephone booth.

                         DAVID
               Yes, operator.  I'd like to
               call the United States and
               reverse the charges.  David
               Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll
               wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code
               315/472-3402.  Thank you.
                    (pause)
               Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes,
               you'll accept the charges.
               Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom
               or Dad home?  Where are they?
               Where's Max?  You're all
               alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't
               leave me alone when I was ten.
               No, not ten and a half either.
               I'm still in London.  I'm all
               better.  Look, would you tell
               Mom and Dad that I love them?
               I don't care, Rachel, just do
               it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And,
               Rachel, don't fight with Max.
               Well, try.  Look, kid, please
               don't forget to tell Mom and
               Dad I love them.  I love Max
               and you, too.  Well, I do.
               No, I'm not being weird, you
               little creep.  You promise?
               Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love
               you.  Bye.

     He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth
     he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then
     catches sight of something.

81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.

     There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's
     pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
     revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack
     points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles,
     walks across the intersection, and up to the box
     office.

                         TICKET LADY
               Two and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's
     checks.

                         DAVID
               Will you take a traveler's
               check?

                         TICKET LADY
               No, sorry.

     David signs a $100 check and hands it to her.

                         DAVID
               Keep the change.

                         TICKET LADY
               Well, thank you, sir!

     She gives him a ticket.  David goes in.

82   INT. CINEMA - DAY

     A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small
     theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide-
     eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the
     last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David
     goes and sits next to him.

                         DAVID
               Hi, Jack.

                         JACK
               Hi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.

                         DAVID
               What can I say, Jack?

                         JACK
               You don't have to say
               anything.

                         DAVID
               Aren't you going to say, `I
               told you so'?

                         JACK
               If I was still alive, I
               probably would.

                         DAVID
               You look awful.

                         JACK
               Thank you.

                         DAVID
                    (apologizes quickly)
               I didn't mean it.  I don't
               know what I'm saying.  I'm not
               even sure it was me who killed
               those people.  I don't
               remember doing it.

                         JACK
               What about the zoo?

                         DAVID
               Well, even if I'm not the
               wolfman, I am crazy enough to
               do something like that.  I
               mean, here I sit in Leicester
               Square talking to a corpse.
               I'm glad to see you, Jack.

                         JACK
               I want you to meet some
               people.

     Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
     BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.

                         JACK
               David Kessler, this is Gerald
               Bringsly.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Gerald is the man you murdered
               in the subway.  We thought it
               best you didn't see him as
               he's a fresh kill and still
               pretty messy.

                         BRINGSLY
                    (in shadow; very English)
               Yes, I do look most
               unpleasant.

     The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from
     the seat to a puddle on the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               Why are you doing this to me,
               Jack?

                         BRINGSLY
               This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
               He is your good friend,
               whereas I am a victim of your
               carnivorous lunar activities.

                         DAVID
                    (appalled)
               Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I
               have absolutely no idea what
               to say to you.

                         BRINGSLY
               You've left my wife a widow
               and my children fatherless.
               And I understand that I am to
               walk the earth one of the
               living dead until the wolf's
               bloodline is severed and the
               curse lifted.

     Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
     glistens.

                         BRINGSLY
               You must die, David Kessler.

                         JACK
               David, this is Harry Berman
               and his fiancee Judith Browns.

     The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
     Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one
     arm missing.

                         JACK
               And these gentlemen are Alf,
               Ted, and Joseph.

     The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All
     are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen
     illuminating their gore.

                         DERELICT #2
               Can't say we're pleased to
               meet you, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
                    (defeated)
               What shall I do?

                         JACK
               Suicide.

                         HARRY
                    (adamantly)
               You must take your own life!

                         DAVID
               That's easy for you to say -
               you're already dead.

                         BRINGSLY
               No, David.  Harry and I and
               everyone you murder are not
               dead.  The undead.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Why are you doing this to me?

                         JACK
               Because this must be stopped.

                         DAVID
               How shall I do it?

                         JUDITH
               Sleeping pills?

                         DERELICT #1
               Not sure enough.

                         DAVID
               I could hang myself.

                         JACK
               If you did it wrong, it would
               be painful.  You'd choke to
               death.

                         DERELICT #3
               So what?  Let `im choke.

                         JACK
               Do you mind?  The man's a
               friend of mine.

                         DERELICT #3
               Well he ain't no friend of
               mine.

                         BRINGSLY
               Gentlemen, please.

                         HARRY
               A gun.

                         DERELICT #1
               I know where he can get a gun.

                         DAVID
               Don't I need a silver bullet
               or something?

                         JACK
               Be serious, would you?

     David puts his head in his hands.

                         DAVID
               Madness.  I've gone totally
               mad.

                         HARRY
               A gun is good.

                         JUDITH
               You just put the gun to your
               forehead and pull the trigger.

                         BRINGSLY
               If you put it in your mouth,
               then you'd be sure not to
               miss.

                         DAVID
               Thank you, you're all so
               thoughtful.

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back
     from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head
     suddenly.


                                                  CUT TO:

83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT

     The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up.

84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three
     small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle
     staring at him.

                         DAVID
                    (gasps out in anguish)
               Go away!  Please!  Go away!

     The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow
     more severe.

                         DAVID
                    (his face contorting)
               Run!  Please...run.

     His hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick
     hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in
     fascination.

85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The
     TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:
                         TICKET TAKER
               I'll check on the house.

     He goes inside the theater.

86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie
     continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He
     cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something
     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!

                                                  CUT TO:

87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

     From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and
     single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema
     through the busy traffic.

88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

                         TICKET LADY
               It's horrible, horrible!
               There's a beast!  A mad dog!
               It's killing people in there!

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.

89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the
     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes
     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly
     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its
     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,
     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.

90   EXT. CINEMA

     As the cop bolts the door shut.

                         COP #1
               For God's sake, Tom, there's a
               monster in there!
     The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them
     down.  The cops strain to keep them shut.

                         COP #1
               Call for assistance and tell
               them to bring guns.

     Pedestrians start milling around.  The door is bulging.
     The Wolf's roars continue.

                         COP #2
               Keep moving!  Will you people
               get out of the way!

91   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep.  Dr. Hirsch wakes her.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nurse Hobbs said there's a
               disturbance in Leicester
               Square involving some sort of
               mad dog.

                         ALEX
               David?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I doubt it.  But it's
               something to do.

92   INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are
     distributed to uniformed men.

93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are
     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door
     closed against the Wolf's battering.

     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers
     and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               What the hell is going on
               here?

                         COP
               It's some kind of animal, sir.
               We....
     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the
     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders
     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.

     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops
     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf
     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly
     barricade the entrance to the alley.

94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
     Square.  Police vehicles roar past.

                         ALEX
               David!  It's David!

     She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her.


95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

     The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the
     alley.  Alex runs to them.

                         ALEX
               Let me through!

                         COP
               Stand clear, miss!

                         ALEX
               I must get through!

     Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley.  The
     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the
     police line.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex!

     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.

                         ALEX
               David?  Is it you?  Is it
               true, David?

     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the
     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.

                         ALEX
               David?

     THE WOLF REARS UP.  In that brief instant, Alex
     realizes it will kill her.

                         OFFICER
               Fire!

     The guns blaze.  The Wolf falls dead.  Alex leans on
     the wall, numb.  The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus
     run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and
     riddled with bullets.  Alex begins to weep.

                                                  FADE TO:

FADE IN

1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT

     on the moon.

     EXT. MOON

     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
     song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are
     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
     superimposed.

               An American Werewolf in London

     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.

2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a
     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
     have earned their literary reputation.

     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
     climbs down.

     "Moon Shadow" ends.


                                                  CUT TO:

     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both
     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.

     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and
     stretch.

     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER

     They've been cramped for hours.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
               Here, lads, East Proctor and
               all about are the moors.  I go
               east here.

                         JACK
               Yes, well thank you very much
               for the ride, sir.  You have
               lovely sheep.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
                    (as he clambers back
                     up on his truck)
               Boys, keep off the moors.
               Stay on the road.  Good luck
               to you.

                         DAVID
               Thanks again!

     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put
     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
     towards East Proctor.

     EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     As they walk, their breath visible:

                         JACK
               Are you cold?

                         DAVID
               Yes.

                         JACK
               Good.

     They walk on, finally:

                         DAVID
               Jack.

                         JACK
               David.

                         DAVID
               You're not having a good time
               are you?

                         JACK
               Oh, I don't know.  I mean look
               around.  Isn't this a fun
               place?

     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
     foreboding.

                         DAVID
               Well, I like it here.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.  Northern England
               first, Italy later.

                         DAVID
               Right.

     They walk on.
                         JACK
               Do you think she'll meet me in
               Rome?

                         DAVID
               I think Debbie Klein is a
               mediocre person with a good
               body.

                         JACK
               Debbie is not mediocre and she
               has one of the great bodies of
               all time.

                         DAVID
               She's a jerk.

                         JACK
               You're talking about the woman
               I love.

                         DAVID
               I'm talking about a girl you
               want to fuck, so give me a
               break.

                         JACK
               Well, anyway, do you think
               she'll be there?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.

                         JACK
                    (like an announcer)
               Rendezvous in Rome starring
               Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.
               The love affair that shocked
               Europe!  See torrid lovemaking
               at its most explicit!  See
               Jack and Debbie expose their
               lust in the sacred halls of
               the Vatican!  Never has the
               screen dared....

                         DAVID
               If you don't stop, I'm going
               to kill you.

                         JACK
               I have to make love to her.
               It's very simple.  She has no
               choice really.

                         DAVID
               It just fascinates me that you
               can spend so much energy on
               someone so dull.

                         JACK
               It is impossible for a body
               like that to be dull.

                         DAVID
               We've known Debbie what, since
               the eighth grade?  How many
               years of foreplay is that?

                         JACK
               She says she `likes me too
               much'.

     David just laughs and laughs and laughs.


                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

3    EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly
     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a
     very small population and the place looks empty.  David
     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The
     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and
     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.

4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
     Slaughtered Lamb".

                         JACK
               The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed fox head on a
               spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's a wolf's head.

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed wolf's head on
               a spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's not a spear.  It's a
               pike.

                         DAVID
               A severed wolf's head on a
               pike as their symbol.

                         JACK
               David, before we go in there I
               want you to know that - no
               matter what happens to us -
               it's your fault.

                         DAVID
               I assume full responsibility.

                         JACK
               Okay.

                         DAVID
               Shall we?

5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with
     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by
     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older
     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are
     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is
     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about
     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They
     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types
     and the general level of noise in the room.

     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead
     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
     strange attention.  They give each other a "what?"
     look, then turn to the assembled populace.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Nice to see you.

     FACES

     Silent and staring.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID AND JACK

                         DAVID
                    (smiles)
               It's very cold outside.  May
               we come in?

     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over
     to a table and very self-consciously remove their
     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman
     finally comes over to them.

                         JACK
               Do you have any hot soup?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         DAVID
               Well, do you have any coffee?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Hot chocolate?
                         WOMAN
               We've got spirits and beer.
               If it's something hot you
               want, you can have tea.

                         JACK
               Then you have some hot tea?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Oh.

                         WOMAN
               But I can heat some up for you
               if you'd like.

                         DAVID & JACK
               Yes, please.

     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.

                         JACK
               Nice looking group.

                         DAVID
               Listen, at least it's warm in
               here.

                         JACK
               Look at that.

                                                  CUT TO:

     JACK'S P.O.V.

     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.

                         DAVID
               What about it?

                         JACK
               It's a five-pointed star.

                         DAVID
               Maybe the owners are from
               Texas.

     The Woman brings them their tea.

                         JACK
                    (to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?

                         WOMAN
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               He was joking.  Thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Joking?  I remember The Alamo.
               I saw it once in London, in
               Leicester Square.

     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS
     explains:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               She means in the cinema, that
               film with John Wayne.
                    (turns to board)
               Checkmate.

                         DAVID
               Oh, yes, of course.

                         JACK
               Right, with Laurence Harvey
               and everybody died in it.  It
               was very bloody.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Bloody awful if you ask me!

     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.  Jack and
     David smile politely.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you
               hear the one about the
               crashing plane?

                         WOMAN
               No, but we're about to.

     Laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               You be quiet, woman, and let
               me speak.

                         WOMAN
                    (heavy sarcasm)
               Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

     Uproarious laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               All right, laugh then.  I
               shan't tell it.

                         WOMAN
               Oh, come on, tell us.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No.  You've had your chance.

     The men all coax him to tell the joke.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Ask them what the candles are
               for.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Listen, that's a pentangle, a
               five-pointed star.  It's used
               in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,
               Jr. and Universal Studios
               maintain it's the mark of the
               wolf man.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               I see.  You want me to ask
               these people if they're
               burning candles to ward off
               monsters.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Right.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Wrong.
     The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
     joke as everyone knew he would.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, all right.  There was this
               airplane over the Atlantic on
               its way to New York.  It was
               full of men from the United
               Nations.

                         WOMAN
               That's very funny, that is.

     Uproarious laughter.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Go on, ask them.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here now, let me finish!  So
               halfway over the ocean the
               engines run low on petrol so
               they have to lighten the
               plane.  So they heave out all
               the baggage, but it's still
               too heavy.  So they chuck out
               the seats, but it's still too
               heavy!  Finally this Froggy
               steps up and shouts "Viva la
               France" and leaps out.  Then
               an Englishman....

                         DART PLAYERS
               Hear!  Hear!

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (undaunted)
               ...steps up and shouts `God
               save the Queen!' and leaps
               out.  But the plane is still
               too heavy.  So the Yank
               delegate from Texas steps up,
               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
               and chucks out the Mexican.

     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is
     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the
     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
     Player gasps out...
                         DART PLAYER
               Remember the Alamo!

     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.

                         JACK
               Excuse me, but what's that
               star on the wall for?

     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and
     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look
     hard indeed.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               You've made me miss.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.

                         DART PLAYER
               I've never missed the board
               before.

                         DAVID
               Jack, we'd better go.

                         JACK
               What do you mean?  I'm
               starving.

                         DART PLAYER
               There's no food here.

     The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
     bit urgent.

                         DAVID
               Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

                         JACK
               Apparently so.

     The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
     for the door.

                         WOMAN
                    (to men)
               You can't let them go.

                         DAVID
                    (worried)
               How much do we owe you?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nothing, lads.  Go, God be
               with you.

                         DAVID
               Uh, thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Wait!  You just can't let them
               go!

                         DART PLAYER
               Go!  And stay on the road.
               Keep clear of the moors.

                         DAVID
               Yes, well, thanks again.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Beware the moon, lads!

     David pushes Jack out.

6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is very cold.

                         JACK
               What the hell was that all
               about?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Let's see if
               there's an inn or something up
               the road.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon?

                         DAVID
               Come on, I'm freezing.

     They start up the road into the night.

7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is quiet.

                         WOMAN
               You can't let them go.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               Should the world know our
               business?!

                         CHESS PLAYER
               It's murder then.

                         DART PLAYER
               Then murder it is!  It's in
               God's hands now.

     The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
     floor.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

     walking on the road surrounded by darkness.

                         DAVID
               That was weird.  I guess
               leaving was the best idea.

                         JACK
               I don't know.  Now that we're
               out here and it's three
               degrees, I'm not so sure I
               wouldn't rather face a blood-
               thirsty mob.

                         DAVID
               Well, not quite a blood-
               thirsty mob.

     They keep walking.

                         JACK
               What do you think was wrong?

                         DAVID
               I have no idea.

                         JACK
               Maybe that pentangle was for
               something supernatural.

                         DAVID
               I see and they were too
               embarrassed to talk about it,
               because they felt so silly.
     There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
     illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The
     clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.

                         DAVID
               Please don't rain.

     Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.

                         DAVID
               Of course.

     They walk getting soaked.

                         JACK
               Say, David....

                         DAVID
               I'm well aware of how pleasant
               the weather is in Rome at the
               present time thank you.

     Jack spreads his arms and sings.

                         JACK
               Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.

9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
     windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess
     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.

                         WOMAN
               Perhaps they'll be safe in the
               rain.

     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No one brought them here!  No
               one wanted them here!

                         WOMAN
               You could have told them!

                         DART PLAYER
               Are you daft?  What do you
               think they'd say?  They'd
               think us mad.

                         WOMAN
               Listen!

     The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl.

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear it?  We must go
               to them.

                         DART PLAYER
               I heard nothing.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
     shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess
     Player turns suddenly.

10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from
     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is
     a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The
     drizzle stops.

                         JACK
               Did you hear that?

                         DAVID
               I heard that.

                         JACK
               What was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.

                         DAVID
               Could be a lot of things.

                         JACK
               Yeah?

                         DAVID
               A coyote.

                         JACK
               There aren't any coyotes in
               England.

                         DAVID
               The Hound of the Baskervilles.

                         JACK
               Pecos Bill.

                         DAVID
               Heathcliffe.

                         JACK
               Heathcliffe didn't howl.

                         DAVID
               No, but he was on the moors.

                         JACK
               It's a full moon, `beware the
               moon'.

     Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very
     inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

                         JACK
               I vote we go back to The
               Slaughtered Lamb.

                         DAVID
               Yeah.

     They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
     from where they just came.  Although after a bit of
     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out
     of breath.

                         DAVID
               We're lost.

     Another bloodcurdling howl.

                         JACK
               Shit!  David, what is that?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Come on.

                         JACK
               Come on, where?

                         DAVID
               Anywhere!  I think we should
               just keep moving.

     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the
     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something
     out there.  It starts to walk.

                         DAVID
               It's moving.

                         JACK
               It's circling us.

     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four
     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.

                         JACK
               Fuck.

     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It
     sits breathing heavily.

                         DAVID
               What's the plan?

                         JACK
                    (nervously)
               Plan?

                         DAVID
                    (not too relaxed
                     himself)
               Let's just keep walking.

     They do and David keeps talking as they walk.

                         DAVID
               That's right, a lovely stroll
               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,
               isn't this fun?

     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys
     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.

                         DAVID
               It's in front of us.

                         JACK
               Do you think it's a dog?

     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.

     BOYS' P.O.V.

     Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking
     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
     and its breath is visible.

                         JACK
               Oh shit.  What is that?

                         DAVID
               A sheep dog or something.
               Turn slowly and let's walk
               away.

     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.

                         JACK
               Nice doggie.  Good boy.

                         DAVID
               Walk away, Jack.

                         JACK
               Walking away, yes, sir.  Here
               we are walking away.

     They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes
     flight they stop, panting.

                         DAVID
               See anything?

                         JACK
               No.

     A moment of quiet, then a howl.

                         DAVID
               It sounds far away.

                         JACK
               Not far enough.  Come on.

     They walk briskly.

                         DAVID
               Jack?

                         JACK
               Yeah.

                         DAVID
               Where are we going?

                         JACK
               I'll tell you when we get
               there.

                         DAVID
               Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays
     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
     Jack laugh.

                         JACK
               You really scared me, you
               shithead.

                         DAVID
               Are you going to help me up?

     Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
     THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!

     EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

     The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.
     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and
     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to
     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams
     and the wolf's roars combine.

                         JACK
               Jesus fuck!  David!  Please
               help me!  Please!  David!
               Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath.

                         DAVID
               Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!

     He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody
     mess on the ground.  He stares in horror.

                         DAVID
               Jack....

     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as
     he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs
     clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the
     hulking form rolls off of him.

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,
     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers
     crowd around, David falls back and faints.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital
     room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder
     bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.
     There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and
     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his
     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look
     around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls
     out....

                         DAVID
               Jack?!

     ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a
     nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very
     beautiful.  She goes to the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her
     thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     David remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS
     GALLAGHER, comes in.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He all right?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think.  He
               called out just now.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He's an American, you know.
               Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch
               round one of those Embassy
               fellows to see him.

                         ALEX
               Chart says he's from New York.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I think he's a Jew.

                         ALEX
               Why on earth do you say that?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I looked.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Really, Susan, I don't think
               that was very proper, and
               besides, it's common practice
               now.

     A voice startles the girls.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss
               Price is quite right.

     DR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the
     customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring
     presence.  The girls are embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried
               out a minute ago.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, surely you
               must perform some function
               here at the hospital.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Then get on with it.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

     She exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex
     watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Can I be of service, Miss
               Price?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Go about your duties.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

     She starts to exit.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, Miss Price?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What exactly did he call out?

                         ALEX
               He said `Jack'.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               That would be Jack Goodman,
               the boy who was killed.

                         ALEX
               What happened to them?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The police report said an
               escaped lunatic attacked them.
               He must have been a very
               powerful man.  Although I
               really don't see that it is
               any of your concern, Miss
               Price.

                         ALEX
               No, sir.  Of course, sir.
               Good day, Doctor.

     She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination,
     looking into David's eyes.

12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the
     almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the
     footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.  The
     camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about,
     the panting continuing.  The breathing gets louder and
     harder, then too loud when we:

                                                  CUT TO:

13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
     contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing
     beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr.
     Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch
               and this is a countryman of
               yours, Mr. Collins.

                         DAVID
               Where am I?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're in a hospital in
               London.

                         DAVID
               London?  Where's Jack?  I had
               a strange dream.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I should think so after your
               recent traumatic experiences.

                         DAVID
               The guy I was with.  Is he all
               right?  How did I get to
               London?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (quietly)
               Now, David, I want you to
               prepare yourself; your friend
               is dead.
     David jolts up in bed and shouts.

                         DAVID
               What?

     The sudden exertion and strain hurt.

                         DAVID
               Ow, shit!

     He sinks back down.

                         DAVID
               Jack's dead?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins
               of the American Embassy here
               in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr.
               Goodman's parents and your
               parents have been notified of
               your injuries and everything's
               in order.

                         DAVID
               Everything's in order?  What
               are you talking about?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Goodman's body has been
               air-freighted back to New York
               for burial and your parents
               have wired funds for your stay
               in the hospital until you are
               well enough to fly home.

                         DAVID
                    (controlled tears)
               You don't crate and ship Jack
               like some side of beef.
                    (approaching hysteria)
               Who the hell are you people?
               What's going on here?  Where
               is Jack?  I demand to see him!

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (holds David down,
                     calls out)
               Miss Price!  Miss Price,
               please!

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Get your fucking hands off me!
               What the hell is going on
               here?

     Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion.

                         MR. COLLINS
                    (distraught, clutching
                     his briefcase)
               I realize how upsetting this
               must be for you, Mr. Kessler,
               but please try to refrain from
               hysterics.

     David continues shouting and struggling.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Prepare a hypodermic, please,
               Miss Price.

     The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr.
     Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more
     normal.

                         MR. COLLINS
               Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to
               excite yourself.  Everything
               has been arranged.  I shall
               come back to check on your
               progress and send a report to
               your parents.  The police have
               requested to interview you and
               I have given them permission
               to do so.

     Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Thank you very much, Mr.
               Collins.  He'll rest now and
               I'm sure everything will be
               fine once he's adjusted.  He's
               had quite a shock.

                         MR. COLLINS
               These dumb-ass kids never
               appreciate anything you do for
               them.

     Mr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.

                         DAVID
               How long have I been here?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've been unconscious since
               you were brought in two weeks
               ago.

                         DAVID
               Two weeks?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've suffered some rather
               severe cuts and bruises, lost
               a bit of blood, but nothing
               too serious; black and blue
               for a while.  You'll have some
               dueling scars to boast of.
               That lunatic must have been a
               very fierce fellow.  They say
               a mad man has the strength of
               ten.

                         DAVID
                    (softly, as the drugs
                     take hold)
               Lunatic?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now we've just given you a
               pretty strong sedative, so try
               to get some rest now.  Miss
               Price will see to your needs.
               Rest now.

     Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers.

                         DAVID
                    (softly)
               It wasn't a lunatic.

                         ALEX
                    (puzzled)
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               It was a wolf.

                         ALEX
                    (bends down close
                     to hear)
               What?

                         DAVID
               A wolf.

     David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did he say a wolf?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I believe he did.

     Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.

14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk
     calendar.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               But Roger is so terribly
               boring.  Yes, dear, but
               couldn't we...I see.
                    (he makes a note)
               Thursday at eight, dinner with
               boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I
               will; if I survived Rommel, I
               suppose I'll survive another
               excruciating evening with
               Roger Mathison.  Be a good
               girl.  Bye.

     He hangs up very disgruntled.  The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
               are here to see you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Send them in.

     He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall,
     the other rather pudgy.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come in, come in.  Please sit.
               Some tea?

     The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a
     small notebook.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               I'd like some tea, please.

     Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe
               later.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's no problem.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Well, then, what can I do for
               Scotland Yard?

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We understand the Kessler boy
               has regained consciousness.

     Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Sorry.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has Mr. Kessler said anything
               regarding the attack on the
               moors?

     The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Excuse me.  Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Roger Mathison, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What here?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               He's on the telephone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Tell him I'm out.  No, tell
               him I've passed away.  An old
               war wound or something.  Tell
               him I'm dead.  And no more
               calls!

     He turns from the intercom back to the cops.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You were saying?

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has David Kessler anything to
               say concerning the attack on
               the moors?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Why don't we ask him?

15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David sits up in bed.  Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
     stand by his side.  Dr. Hirsch sits observing.

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry if I conflict with
               your report, but Jack and I
               were not attacked by a man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               So you've said.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               He may have a point,
               Lieutenant.  Two strong boys
               would be able to defend
               themselves against one man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Sgt. McManus, are you
               suggesting that David and Jack
               were, in fact, attacked by
               some animal and that the
               officialdom of East Proctor
               has conspired to keep it a
               secret?  We have an autopsy
               report on the murderer who was
               shot in the act by the local
               police.  We have two witnesses
               to the crime.  You'll forgive
               me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider
               your testimony as coming from
               someone who has gone through a
               terrible shock.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Lieutenant, the boy seems
               pretty lucid to me and....

                         LT. VILLIERS
               And what, Sergeant?

                         SGT. McMANUS
                    (defeated)
               I don't rightly know, sir.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               That is precisely my point.
               David, as far as we are
               concerned, the matter is
               closed.  We won't trouble you
               any further.  Good day.

     The lieutenant goes for the door.  The sergeant smiles
     at David and follows.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Doctor.

     The cops exit.  Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.

                         DAVID
               There were witnesses?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               So they said.

                         DAVID
               How could there have been
               witnesses?  It was so dark.
               We were running and I fell and
               Jack went to help me up and
               this thing came from
               nowhere...I don't understand
               what they're talking about.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               In time I'm sure it will all
               come back to you.

                         DAVID
               Doctor, my memory is fine.
               It's my sanity I'm beginning
               to worry about.

                                                  CUT TO:

16   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through
     the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the
     runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs
     for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.
     David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness
     of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements,
     looking about.

     CLOSEUP

     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
     animalness.

     DAVID

     takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and
     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with
     him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We
     see him completely as the animal, study his movement
     and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops
     again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly
     he pushes some leaves aside.

     CLOSEUP

     of his eyes.

     DAVID'S P.O.V.

     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and
     freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The
     buck turns his head, feeling the danger.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders
     tensing.

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

     CLOSEUP

     of the frightened deer.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     THE FAWN

     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame
     as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame,
     his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered
     with blood.  He howls in triumph.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door
     opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss
     Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to
     David, turns on the bed light and touches him.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.

                         DAVID
                    (awakened)
               I was having a nightmare.

     Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the
     pills and pouring a glass of water.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, well these should help
               that.  That's right, drink up.

     David takes the pills.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Now go back to sleep so you'll
               be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the
               morning.

                         DAVID
               What time is it?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               It's nearly eight.  I'm off
               duty shortly, then I'm off to
               the films with Alex.

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Miss Price, the other nurse
               that attended you.

                         DAVID
               What are you going to see?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               An American film about the
               Mafia called `See You Next
               Wednesday', and I want to see
               it badly, so you give me no
               problems and go to sleep.

                         DAVID
                    (dropping off)
               Do you have bad dreams, too?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Some, everyone does.

                         DAVID
               Yes, but does everyone kill
               Bambi?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Bambi?

     David has fallen asleep.  Miss Gallagher turns off the
     light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Kill Bambi?

     She exits, closing the door plunging the room into
     darkness.

18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY

     The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys
     about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing
     appropriate background actions.  Behind the Nurses'
     Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,
     obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with
     different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from
     the drug cabinet.  She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Take these round now, will you
               please?  The American boy in
               twenty-one is only to have
               these after he's eaten.  Will
               you be sure of that?

                         ALEX
               Has he been refusing food?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Nothing quite as dramatic as
               that, Miss Price.  He just
               doesn't eat enough of what is
               put before him.  He suffers
               from nightmares.  I'd think he
               just needs a hand to hold.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way
     down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her
     appearance.  She enters.

19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY

     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.
     She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.

                         ALEX
               Hello, Benjamin.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Well, all right then, be that
               way.  Here, swallow this.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.
     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin
     who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,
     handing Alex back the glass.

                         ALEX
               Feeling better?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               The doctor will be round
               later.  Would you like a
               picture book to look at?  We
               have some lovely funny Beanos.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black
     Jamaican ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into
     Benjamin's ward.

20   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

                         ALEX
               Has the patient in twenty-one
               gotten his tray yet?

                         ORDERLY
               The American?  Yes, duck.

                         ALEX
               How did he look?

                         ORDERLY
               What do you mean, `how did he
               look'?

                         ALEX
               You know, did he seem
               depressed?  Do you think he'll
               eat the food?

                         ORDERLY
                    (annoyed)
               I'm an orderly, not a bleeding
               psychiatrist!  I push things
               about, but I've little say
               what happens to them.

                         ALEX
               Thank you.

     Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room.
     She hesitates, then peeks in.

21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits
     patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is
     apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               Mr. Kessler?

                         DAVID
                    (lifeless)
               Yes?

                         ALEX
               You haven't eaten your lunch.

                         DAVID
               I'm not very hungry, thank
               you.

                         ALEX
               I'm afraid you have to eat
               something.

                         DAVID
               Please, really.  I'm not
               hungry.

                         ALEX
               You put me in an awkward
               position, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
               How is that?

                         ALEX
                    (she shakes the paper cup)
               Well, you're to take these
               after you've eaten.  Now what
               kind of nurse would I be if I
               failed in so simple a task as
               giving out some pills?

                         DAVID
               Leave the pills.  I'll take
               them later.

                         ALEX
               Sorry.

     She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Miss Price!

                         ALEX
               Call me Alex.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Alex!

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               Mr. Kessler?

     David is getting interested.

                         DAVID
               Call me David.

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               David?

                         DAVID
               This is absurd.  I'm not
               hungry.  I don't want any
               food.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in
     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David
     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under
     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.

                         ALEX
               Let's try a little harder,
               shall we?

                         DAVID
               Will you give me a break?

     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused
     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds
     up another bite.

                         ALEX
               Will I have to take such
               drastic action again, David?

     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.
     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
     other up.  Finally:

                         DAVID
               May I have a glass of milk?

     Alex smiles.

FADE OUT

     FADE IN

22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again we are running fast and faster.  David again
     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He
     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:

                         JACK (O.S.)
               David!  David!  Please help
               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my
               God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
     screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-
     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There
     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same
     as David's.

     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed
     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the
     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches
     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the
     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches
     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The
     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
     His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale
     white with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in
     the....

                                                  CUT TO:

23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls
     out....

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!

     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly, go at once to twenty-
               one and restrain the patient.

     The orderly exits.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Gallagher, remain here at
               the desk.  I'll be in twenty-
               one.

     She exits.

24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes
     thoughtfully out the window.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've never had bad dreams
               before?

                         DAVID
                    (upset)
               Sure, as a kid.  But never so
               real.  Never so bizarre.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did you get a good look at the
               man who attacked you?

                         DAVID
               I've told you, it wasn't a
               man.  It was an animal.  A big
               wolf or something.  A rabid
               dog.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (chewing on his glasses)
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've
               been traumatized, but Jack was
               torn apart.  I saw him.  A man
               can't do that to someone with
               his bare hands.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You'd be surprised what
               horrors a man is capable of.

                         DAVID
               Did you see Jack?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               No.  In fact, your wounds were
               cleaned and dressed before you
               arrived here.

                         DAVID
               Did you talk to the police in
               East Proctor?  Did the cops go
               to The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I really don't know.

                         DAVID
               Then why the hell are you so
               quick to disbelieve me?  You
               yourself said it must have
               taken incredible strength to
               tear apart a person like that.
                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (rubs his forehead)
               David, please.  The police are
               satisfied.  I'm certain that
               if a monster were out roaming
               northern England we'd have
               seen it on the telly.

                         DAVID
               You really think I'm crazy,
               don't you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Believe me.  The Hound of the
               Baskervilles was an invention
               of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.
               And if you'd read the bloody
               book, you'd find that Holmes
               discovered your house of hell
               a fraud, a fake.

     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.
     Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now really, David.  You're far
               too intelligent to go on this
               way.  When you return to
               America I want you to seek out
               a competent psychiatrist or
               psychologist or something and
               stop this nonsense.  You'll be
               leaving this hospital in three
               or four days, please remain
               sane.  At least until you are
               no longer our responsibility.

     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.

                         DAVID
               Dr. Hirsch?
                    (pause)
               I'd rather not be by myself.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Of course not, David.  I'll
               fetch in young Miss Price.

25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and
     she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.
     The room is dark except for the lamp by which she
     reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King
     Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex
     reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.
     She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and
     feet, fingers and toes stretch.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               You're a very beautiful girl.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               I thought you were asleep.

                         DAVID
               I was.  What are you reading?

                         ALEX
               `A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

                         DAVID
               Do you like it?

                         ALEX
               I've just started it.  My
               friend gave it to me.

     They look at each other.

                         ALEX
               What do you dream about?

                         DAVID
               I dream of death mostly.

                         ALEX
               I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have
               asked you.

                         DAVID
               It's okay.  I want to talk to
               you.

     They sit and look at each other for a while longer.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               That's not really a very
               proper question.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               Twenty-eight.

                         DAVID
               I'm twenty-seven.

                         ALEX
               I know.

                         DAVID
               Now what do you want to talk
               about?

                         ALEX
               Was Jack Goodman your good
               friend?

                         DAVID
                    (seriously)
               My best friend.  My very best
               friend.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               Shall I read to you?

                         DAVID
               What?  Oh, yes, please.

                         ALEX
                    (opens book)
               A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court by Samuel L.
               Clemens.  This is after the
               preface but before chapter
               one: A Word of Explanation.
               You all right?

                         DAVID
                    (settles back)
               Yes, go on.

                         ALEX
                    (clears her throat)
               Ahem, A Word of Explanation.
               It was in Warwick Castle that
               I came across the curious
               stranger whom I am going to
               talk about.  He attracted me
               by three things: his candid
               simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient
               armor, and the restfulness of
               his company - for he did all
               the talking.  We fell together
               as modest people will in the
               tail of the herd....

26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT

     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His
     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
     television.  We can see past the small dining nook
     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful
     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and
     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.

                         FATHER
               I'll get it.

     The pounding continues.

                         FATHER
               All right, all right!  Hold
               your horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he
     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence
     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the
     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in
     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into
     his chair by one of the things and held there.

                         DAVID
               Stop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
     slits David's throat.

27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee
     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to
     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides
     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and
     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David
     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up
     anyway.

                         ALEX
                    (yawns, smiles)
               Hello.  You all right?

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry I woke you up.

                         ALEX
               Don't be silly.  Can I get you
               something?

                         DAVID
               No, thank you.  Just keep me
               company for a while.

                         ALEX
               That's easy enough.

                         DAVID
               I keep having these really
               terrible dreams.  They are
               getting worse and I can't seem
               to stop them.

                         ALEX
               David, your dreams will stop.
               You'll leave England and your
               bad memories; and then this
               will all fade away.

                         DAVID
               Will you come with me?

                         ALEX
                    (taken aback)
               What?

                         DAVID
                    (smiling)
               I'm serious.  You don't know
               me and I know nothing about
               you.  We have a perfect
               relationship.

                         ALEX
               Now, David, I said I would
               keep you company, but I meant
               right here and now.

                         DAVID
               Will you think about it?

                         ALEX
               How did we get from your bad
               dreams to my taking a holiday
               with a patient?

                         DAVID
                    (big grin)
               Not just a patient -- me.

                         ALEX
               You're being awfully forward,
               aren't you?

                         DAVID
               Forgive me, I'm trying to
               cheer myself up and an affair
               with a beautiful nurse seemed
               like just the thing to do it.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               All I am to you is a sex
               fantasy then?

                         DAVID
               Now I'm embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Good.  I thought for a moment
               I was the only embarrassed one
               in the room.

     There is an awkward pause.

                         DAVID
               Where were we in the book?

     Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.

                         ALEX
                    (looking through
                     the book)
               Let me see here.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast
     tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the
     bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.

                         ORDERLY
               Ah you're up.  Good morning
               and a good day to you.  We've
               quite a meal for you here this
               morning.  Bacon, oatmeal,
               orange juice, and toast with
               jam.  Good stuff there.  Now
               eat it up and I'll be back for
               the dishes when you've
               finished.

     The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been
     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,
     notices his exit.

                         DAVID
               Good morning.

     He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a
     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.

                         DAVID
                    (in mock English accent)
               Please, sir, I want some more.

     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his
     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear
     Jack's o.s. voice.

                         JACK (O.S.)
               Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving
     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him
     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud
     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his
     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he
     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome
     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
     at all.

                         JACK
                    (pleasantly)
               Nice to see you.

                         DAVID
                    (unbelieving)
               Get the fuck out of here,
               Jack.

                         JACK
               Thanks a lot.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               This is too much.  I can't
               handle this.

                         JACK
               I'm aware that I don't look so
               great, but I thought you'd be
               glad to see me.

     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat
     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at
     Jack horrified.

                         JACK
               David!  You're hurting my
               feelings.

                         DAVID
                    (astounded)
               Hurting your feelings?  Has it
               occurred to you that it may be
               unsettling to have you rise
               from your grave to visit me?
               Listen to me, I'm talking to a
               hamburger!

                         JACK
               I'm sorry to be upsetting you,
               David, but I had to come.

                         DAVID
                    (aghast)
               Aren't you supposed to be
               buried in New York someplace?

                         JACK
               Yeah.  Your parents came to my
               funeral.  I was surprised at
               how many people came.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Why should you be surprised?
               You were a very well-liked
               person.

                         JACK
               Debbie Klein cried a lot.

                         DAVID
               I can't stand it.

                         JACK
               So you know what she does?
               She's so grief stricken she
               runs to find solace in Rudy
               Levine's bed.

                         DAVID
               Rudy Levine the shmuck?

                         JACK
               Life mocks me even in death.

     Jack takes another bite of toast.

                         DAVID
                    (to himself)
               I'm going completely crazy.

                         JACK
                    (loud)
               David!

                         DAVID
                    (louder)
               What?!

                         JACK
               David, now I know this may be
               hard for you, but I have to
               warn you.

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Warn me?  Will you get out of
               here, you meat loaf?

                         JACK
               I'm a grisly sight, it's true;
               but I love you and that's why
               I'm here.  You've got to know.

                         DAVID
               If you love me so much, Jack,
               you'll realize how
               disconcerting it is to share
               one's breakfast with the
               living dead!

                         JACK
               We were attacked by a
               werewolf.

                         DAVID
                    (covers his ears)
               I'm not listening!

                         JACK
               On the moors, we were attacked
               by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

                         DAVID
               Shut up, you zombie!

                         JACK
               I was murdered, an unnatural
               death, and now I walk the
               earth in limbo until the
               werewolf's curse is lifted.

                         DAVID
                    (incredulous, furious)
               What's wrong with you?  Shut
               up!

                         JACK
               The wolf's bloodline must be
               severed.  The last remaining
               werewolf must be destroyed.

                         DAVID
               Will you be quiet?!

     Jack rises and comes closer to David.

                         JACK
               It's you, David.

                         DAVID
               What?!

                         JACK
               You survived and now you shall
               continue the curse.

                         DAVID
               What are you talking about?  I
               won't accept this!  Get out!
               God damit!

                         JACK
               Remember what that guy at The
               Slaughtered Lamb said?
               `Beware the moon.'

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Stop it, Jack.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon.  The full
               moon, David.  You've got two
               days.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Jack, please go away.  Please
               go away.

                         JACK
               You'll stalk the streets of
               London a creature of the
               night.

                         DAVID
                    (flares up)
               You're talking like Boris
               Karloff!  It's movie dialogue!

                         JACK
               David, please believe me.  You
               will kill people, David.
               You've got to stop the
               bloodshed before it begins.

                         DAVID
                    (yells)
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               Listen to me!  Take your own
               life, David.  It's our only
               chance.

                         DAVID
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               The supernatural!  The powers
               of darkness!  It's all true.
               Take your own life!  Suicide,
               David.  Join me.

                         DAVID
                    (losing it)
               Nurse!  Oh God!  Alex!

                         JACK
               It's cold, David, and I'm so
               alone.  The undead surround
               me.  Have you ever talked to a
               corpse?  It's boring!  I'm
               lonely!  Kill yourself, David,
               before you kill others.

29   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - DAY

     Alex rushing down the hospital corridor.

30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David rocking back and forth weeping.

                         JACK
               Don't cry, David.

31   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing down hospital corridor.

32   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

                         JACK
               Please don't cry.

33   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing to the door.

34   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - CLOSEUP

                         JACK
                    (softly in looming
                     closeup)
               Beware the moon, David.

                                                  CUT TO:

     ALEX

     as she bursts into the room.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
     He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits
     on the bed and hugs David.

                         ALEX
               David?  David!

     David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly
     until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe
     easier.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?

     David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               I'm a werewolf.

                         ALEX
               A werewolf?

     Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is
     and backs off a little.  David composes himself.

                         ALEX
               Are you better now?

                         DAVID
               I'll let you know the next
               full moon.

                         ALEX
               You're to be discharged
               tomorrow.  Will you be all
               right?

     David takes Alex's hand.

                         DAVID
               My friend Jack was just here.

                         ALEX
               Your dead friend Jack?

                         DAVID
               Yeah.  He says that I will
               become a monster in two days.
               What do you think?

                         ALEX
               What do I think?  You mean
               about the possibility of your
               becoming a monster in two days
               or about visits from dead
               friends?

                         DAVID
               I was dreaming again?

                         ALEX
               I would think so.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Yeah, I would think so, too.

     Alex considers for a while, finally....

                         ALEX
               Do you have a place to stay in
               London?


                                                  CUT TO:

35   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     David and Alex walking down the street.  Alex points
     out her flat and leads David up the front steps.  She
     gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door.

36   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex enters and David follows.  A small, utilitarian
     apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light.  David puts
     his backpack on the floor.

               The bedroom.

                         DAVID
               There is only one bed.

                         ALEX
                    (makes a face)
               David, perhaps you'd like to
               watch the telly while I take a
               shower.

     Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking
     on his heels.

37   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream
     of water in the shower.

               It's nice to see you.

     MONTAGE IN SHOWER - DAY

     A sequence of soap and flesh.  Van Morrison's
     "Moondance" plays.  A montage of soapy hands on
     slippery skin.  Thighs rubbing thighs, arms and
     shoulders.  David and Alex kiss again and again and....

38   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY

     David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's

     After a moment....

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Yes?

                         DAVID
               Will you be here in about
               fifteen minutes?

                         ALEX
               Of course.

                         DAVID
                    (leers)
               Good.

     Alex props herself up on one elbow.

                         ALEX
               David, you don't honestly
               believe that in reality your
               friend Jack rose from the
               grave to breakfast with you?
               Do you really?

                         DAVID
               I was awake and he was in my
               room.

                         ALEX
               But, David.

                         DAVID
                    (firm)
               I wasn't hallucinating.

     Pause.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Tomorrow is the full moon.

                         DAVID
               That's good, Alex.  Reassure
               me.

     Alex begins kissing David's neck.

                         DAVID
               It's all right, I know I'm
               being insane.

     She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.

                         DAVID
               Okay, okay.  I'm properly
               reassured!

     Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually
     lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to
     hold onto the headboard of the bed.

                         DAVID
                    (closing his eyes)
               This is very reassuring.  I'm
               feeling very reassured.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

     INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts
     her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes
     out of the room and goes to the bathroom.

39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces,
     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When
     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine
     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes
     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big
     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in
     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing
     in the doorway.

                         DAVID
                    (points a trembling
                     finger)
               You're not real.

                         JACK
               Don't be an asshole, David.
               Come here.

     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living
     room.

40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM

     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He
     does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not
     to wake up Alex.

                         DAVID
               What are you doing here?

                         JACK
               I wanted to see you.

                         DAVID
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now go
               away.

                         JACK
               David, I'm sorry I upset you
               yesterday, but you must
               understand what is going on.

                         DAVID
               I understand all right.
               You're one of the undead and
               I'm a werewolf.

                         JACK
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Get out of here, Jack!

                         JACK
               David, tomorrow night is the
               full moon.  You'll change,
               you'll become....

                         DAVID
                    (interrupting)
               A monster.  I know, I know.

                         JACK
               You must take your own life
               now, David, before it's too
               late.

                         DAVID
               Jack, are you really dead?

                         JACK
               What do you think?

                         DAVID
               I think I've lost my mind.  I
               think you're not real.  I
               think I'm asleep and you're a
               part of another bad dream.

                         JACK
               You must believe me.

                         DAVID
               What, Jack?  That tomorrow
               night beneath the full moon
               I'll sprout hair and fangs and
               eat people?  Bullshit!

                         JACK
               The canines will be real.
               You'll taste real blood!  God
               damit, David, please believe
               me!  You'll kill and make
               others like me!  I'm not
               having a nice time, David!
               Don't allow this to happen
               again!  You must take your own
               life!

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               I will not accept this!  Now
               go away!

41   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex wakes up from the shouting.

                         ALEX
               David?

42   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                         JACK
                    (quietly)
               This is not pretend, David.

                         DAVID
                    (righteous)
               I will not be threatened by a
               walking meat loaf!

     Alex enters the room.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?  I heard
               voices.

     David turns and sees that Jack is gone.

                         DAVID
                    (triumphant)
               It was just me, Alex.  It was
               just me.


43   EXT. EAST PROCTOR - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is driving down the main street in his red
     M.G.  He parks in front of The Slaughtered Lamb.

44   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - DAY

     The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
     The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the
     Chess Player is still at the chessboard.  Dr. Hirsch
     enters and crosses to the bar.  As he removes his
     gloves:

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A drink for a very cold man?

     The Woman comes in from the back.

                         WOMAN
               Hello, there.  What can I get
               you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Campari and soda would do
               nicely.

                         WOMAN
               Sorry, love.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I suppose Guinness will
               suffice.

     She serves him his beer.  As he lays down his money...

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A thousand thanks.

     After a few sips.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nasty bit of business with
               those two young American boys.

     The Dart Player stops his wiping.

                         DART PLAYER
               I'm afraid I don't know what
               you mean, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, I'm sure that's right.  A
               few weeks ago, the last full
               moon wasn't it?

     The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look
     at Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I mean that escaped lunatic.
               The one that killed the boy.
               Wasn't that near here?

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (concerned)
               And where are you from, sir?

     Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his
     table.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               London.  Knight takes pawn.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               What?

     Sees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game....

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, yes, yes.

     Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What's that?

                         WOMAN
                    (nervously)
               Oh, that's been there for two
               hundred years.  We were going
               to paint it out, but it's
               traditional, so we left it.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I see.  You've heard nothing
               about the incident?

                         DART PLAYER
               Incident?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The murder?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Are you a police officer?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (smiles)
               No, no, hardly.  I work in the
               hospital where the Kessler boy
               was brought.

     The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He was talking about
               werewolves and monsters and as
               I was near here I thought....

                         DART PLAYER
               You thought what?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I thought I'd look into the
               boy's story.

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (scoffs)
               A story about werewolves - now
               really, sir.

     Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Would you like a game of
               chess?

45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door.
     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has
     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously
     not going out.  Alex pulls away.

                         ALEX
               Let me go now, you'll make me
               late.

                         DAVID
               Do me an enormous favor?

                         ALEX
               Anything.

                         DAVID
               Tell me that it's silly of me
               to be apprehensive.

                         ALEX
               It's silly of you to be
               apprehensive.

                         DAVID
               Werewolves simply do not
               exist.

                         ALEX
                    (serious)
               David, do you want me to stay
               here tonight?

                         DAVID
               Yeah, I do, but go to work.

     He opens the door and they both go outside.

46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND
     DAVID

     walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.

                         ALEX
               Listen, if you get too
               anxious, call me at the
               hospital, okay?

                         DAVID
               Okay.

                         ALEX
               I've left those pills for you.

                         DAVID
               A doper werewolf.

     They kiss again.
                         ALEX
               I'm off.  There's food in the
               fridge.

                         DAVID
               See you later.

     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands
     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
     and snarl.

                         DAVID
                    (to dog)
               What did I do?

     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
     tugging on his leash.

                         DAVID
               Thanks a lot, dog.

     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
     up the steps to find the door locked.

                         DAVID
               Wonderful.

     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He
     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.

                         DAVID
               An American werewolf was found
               frozen to death today in the
               heart of London, England.

     He looks around and sees that there is a small window
     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.

     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back
     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is
     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.

                         DAVID
               What did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to
     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David
     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull
     himself into the window.

47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK

     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.

                         DAVID
                    (weakly)
               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.

48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He
     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.

49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

     He lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring
     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
     kitchen.

50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     He reopens the fridge.

                         DAVID
               I'm not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.

51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

     David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer
     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David
     switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
     and humming.

                         DAVID
                    (singing)
               `Moon River, wider than a mile
               I'm crossing you in style,
               Someday....'

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,
     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back
     inside and we note that the front door is not
     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and
     looks into the mirror.

                         DAVID
               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the
               blood of an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and
     round the room like a caged animal.

52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT

     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.

                         ALEX
               How are we feeling tonight?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No!

                         ALEX
                    (smiling)
               Benjamin, have you ever been
               severely beaten about the face
               and neck?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               I thought not.

     She tucks him in.

                         ALEX
               You sleep now and have sweet
               dreams.

                         BENJAMIN & ALEX
               No!

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him
     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
     the window.

53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT

     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.

                         DAVID
               Jesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (screams)
               What?  Christ!  What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
     his head.  He trembles violently.

                         DAVID
               I'm burning up!  Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is
     dripping wet.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts out in
                     pain and fear)
               Jack!?  Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.

                         DAVID
               Help me!  Somebody help me,
               please!  Jack!!

     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at
     his legs.

                         DAVID
                    (pleading, whimpering)
               I'm sorry I called you a meat
               loaf, Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
     burning him.
     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
     for air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives
     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
     to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see
     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth
     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his
     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
     claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into
     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the
     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the
     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
     Wolf padding off into the darkness.


54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An
     attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver
     and the cab drives off.

                         WOMAN
               Which one, Harry?

                         MAN
               Number thirty-nine, but let's
               go `round the back.

                         WOMAN
               Why?

                         MAN
               Come on, we'll give Sean a
               scare.

                         WOMAN
               You're crazy, Harry.

                         HARRY
               Come on.

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of
     the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the
     two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and
     quiet.

55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear something?

                         HARRY
               Just now?

                         WOMAN
               Yes.

                         HARRY
               No.  Here we are, Sean's is
               the one....

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  Before the Woman can scream, the
     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't
     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.

56   INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHT

     Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out
     onto the park - a middle-aged couple.

                         WIFE
               Sean, those hooligans are in
               the park again.

                         SEAN
               Aren't you ready yet?  They'll
               be here any minute.

                         WIFE
               Something's going on out
               there.

57   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense
     medication into paper cups when Dr. Hirsch approaches.
     He is still wearing his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is Miss Price on duty this
               evening?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Yes, Doctor.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, do you know if
               Miss Price has seen the
               Kessler boy since his release?

     Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Uh, I don't know if....

     Alex has walked up and overheard the last.

                         ALEX
               It's all right, Susan.  Yes,
               Doctor, I have.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come to my office, Miss Price.

     Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently
     follows Dr. Hirsch down the hallway.

58   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his
     wife's complaints.  She hangs by the door.  He walks
     deeper into the park.

                         SEAN
                    (calls out)
               Is anyone there?

59   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Sit down, Alex.

     Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I was in East Proctor today.

     Alex looks confused.  Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of
     her concern.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh dear girl, your
               extracurricular activities are
               of no consequence to me.  I
               don't give a damn who you
               sleep with.  I'm concerned
               about David.

                         ALEX
               Yes, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's a full moon.  Where is
               he?

                         ALEX
               At my flat.  I'm off at
               midnight and....

     Dr. Hirsch picks up the phone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The number, Alex.  Your
               number!

60   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean carefully approaches something near the trees.  He
     steps on something and looks down to see what it is.
     It is an arm.

61   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - THE
     TELEPHONE

     rings loudly.  (This is a scare.)  It continues to ring
     unanswered.

62   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He's not there.

     Alex grows worried.

                         ALEX
               He's not?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, has David persisted in
               his werewolf fantasies?

                         ALEX
               Well, yes, but he seems to be
               more upset by the death of his
               friend.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Has his friend appeared to him
               again?

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What did he say?

                         ALEX
               David says Jack comes to warn
               him.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Warn him?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is
               this more serious than I know?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I tried to investigate the
               attack.  There are no records.
               The case was closed and now
               they've `misplaced' the file.
               David's lacerations were
               cleaned and dressed when he
               arrived here and yet
               supposedly no doctor examined
               him before I did.  The Goodman
               boy is already in the ground
               so he's no good to us.  So I
               went to the pub in East
               Proctor where I was convinced
               of two things.

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               They were lying.  There were
               no witnesses, no escaped
               lunatic.  The whole community
               is hiding the truth of what
               actually happened up there.

                         ALEX
               And what else?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I think the village of East
               Proctor is hiding some dark
               and terrible secret.  I'm
               convinced that, like David,
               they believe in this werewolf.

     Alex is flabbergasted.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've absolutely no idea
               where David might be?

                         ALEX
               No.  He knows no one in
               London, besides me.  I
               shouldn't have left him alone.

     Suddenly.

                         ALEX
               Surely you're not
               suggesting....

                         DR. HIRSCH
               David has suffered a severe
               trauma.  I myself witnessed
               some form of mass neurosis in
               East Proctor.  If all the
               villagers believe that Jack
               Goodman was killed by a
               werewolf, why shouldn't David?
               And then it follows that if he
               survived an attack by a
               werewolf, wouldn't he himself
               become a werewolf the next
               full moon?

                         ALEX
                    (bewildered)
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, I don't mean running about
               on all fours and howling at
               the moon.  But in such a
               deranged state he could harm
               himself, or perhaps others.

                         ALEX
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Let's call the police and see
               if they can help us find our
               wandering boy.


63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT

     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London
     are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old
     DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to
     keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its
     ears perk up and he growls in warning.

                         DERELICT #1
               Old Winston smells something.

                         DERELICT #2
                    (calls out)
               Who's there?

     The dog begins to whine.

                         DERELICT #2
               Let `im go.

     Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in
     terror.

                         DERELICT #3
               Brave dog that.

                         DERELICT #1
                    (worried)
               Here - who's there?

     An unearthly howl shatters the night.  We've heard this
     sound on the moors.

                         DERELICT #2
               That's not Winston.

                         DERELICT #3
               Look there.

     He points out into the night.  They strain their eyes -
     something is approaching them.  They can just make out
     its size.

                         DERELICT #1
               Mother Mary of God.

64   INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

     A train SCREECHES to a halt.  (A scare.)  We are in the
     tubes of London.  Only one passenger disembarks and the
     train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous
     hallways.  The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-
     dressed.  He looks about the platform, then at his
     watch.  He walks up to a vending machine to buy a
     Cadbury Chocolate Bar.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - LONG SHOT

     as the Passenger puts his coin in the vending machine.
     The camera is on ground level and as we watch the
     Passenger, the Wolf's legs flash by us.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar.  He turns
     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.
     Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one
     of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's
     tubes.  He feels he's being followed and turns slowly
     to look.  There is no one and he continues, concerned
     about his imagination.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP - WOLF'S EYES

     watching in the darkness.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses,
     then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving
     stairway.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP - WOLF'S SNOUT

     In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and
     black tongue.  It waits, panting, drool falls from its
     mouth.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly
     down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street
     Level".  He is being followed.  He hears it and we hear
     it.  He stops, frightened.

                         PASSENGER
               Hello?

                                                  CUT TO:

     TUNNEL

     Long and empty.

     THE PASSENGER

                         PASSENGER
               Is there someone there?

     We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing.  The Passenger is
     beginning to panic.

                         PASSENGER
               I can assure you that this is
               not in the least bit amusing!

     He looks around wildly.

                         PASSENGER
               I shall report this!

     PASSENGER'S P.O.V.

     We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the
     tunnel towards us.

                         PASSENGER
               Good Lord.

     THE PASSENGER

     turns to flee, his jog becoming a run.  He is
     terrified.

     WOLF - CLOSEUP

     of the Wolf's running steps.

     THE PASSENGER

     frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying
     his nose.  He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear.
     Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving
     stairs, falling several times.  He sits, panting and
     defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.

     WOLF'S P.O.V.

     as it begins to climb the stairs.  The camera tracks
     slowly in on the increasingly horrified Passenger until
     we are in an extreme closeup of his eyes, when we:

65   CLOSEUP - A TIGER ROARING

     (A scare.)  The tiger paces in its cage and roars
     again.  We are at:

     EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     It is early morning and all the animals are aroused.
     We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and
     panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage
     where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground
     by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is
     completely naked, his body dirty, with several
     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and
     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
     something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices
     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean
     them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel
     discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his
     eyes.

                         DAVID
               Wake me up, Alex.

     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
     He stands up and looks around.

     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle
     about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his
     lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all
     concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a
     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.
     He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching
     himself on a thorn.

                         DAVID
               Ouch!

66   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying
     to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The
     phone rings and she runs for it.

                         ALEX
                    (excited, then
                     disappointed)
               Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he
               hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I
               will, doctor, but I just feel
               so helpless sitting here doing
               nothing.  Thank you, yes,
               goodbye.

     She hangs up and looks around the empty flat.  She is
     now more worried than ever.

67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     David is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if
     the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the
     bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DOWAGER'S FACE

     Dumbfounded.

                         DAVID
               Excuse me, won't you?

     He returns to the bushes.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING

     A LITTLE BOY with four helium balloons on a string is
     staring intently at the gorilla.  The Little Boy leaves
     the monkey house and we travel with him as he looks at
     several other animals.  Eventually he comes to the Wolf
     cage.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Pssst!

     The Little Boy looks around.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Hey, kid!  Pssst.  Little boy
               with the balloons.

     The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me?"
                                                  CUT TO:

     THE BUSHES

     David cannot be seen.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Come over here.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush replies:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               If you come over here, I'll
               give you a pound.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush pleads.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Two pounds?

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush reasons:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Listen, two pounds is a lot of
               money.  It's almost five
               dollars.

                         LITTLE BOY
                    (very English)
               I don't know who you are.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               I'm the famous balloon thief.

                         LITTLE BOY
               Why would a thief want to give
               me two pounds?

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (losing patience)
               Come here and I'll show you.

     The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery,
     but stops a few feet away.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (pleading)
               Come on!

     The Little Boy edges forward.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               A little closer.

     When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his
     balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.

                         DAVID
               Thank you.

     David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his
     balloons, startling several animal lovers.

68   EXT. PARK - DAY

     An ELDERLY COUPLE sits feeding birds, their coats
     folded nearly over the park bench.  A naked blur darts
     by, grabbing the top coat as it passes, scaring off the
     birds.

69   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     The Little Boy tugs at his MOTHER'S coat.

                         MOTHER
               Yes, love?

                         LITTLE BOY
               A naked, American man stole my
               balloons.

                         MOTHER
               What?

                         LITTLE BOY
               A naked, American man -- the
               famous balloon thief.

70   EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     The signs they always have on London newsstands
     proclaim "Man or Monster?"  Dr. Hirsch picks up a
     newspaper with its headline, "London Murder Victims
     Found Partially Devoured".

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I'll have one of those, too.

     He pays for the papers.  The second one's headline,
     "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?"

71   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY - BUS STOP

     in another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of
     fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the
     bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to
     floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the
     crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and
     the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high
     heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a
     conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David
     clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar
     trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks
     at him oddly.

                         DAVID
                    (cheerfully)
               A lot of weather we've been
               having lately.

     The man studies David carefully.

72   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading.
     There is loud knocking on the door.  Alex rushes to
     open it and David enters quickly, closing the door
     behind him.  He is still wearing the woman's coat.

                         ALEX
               David!  Where on earth have
               you been!?!

                         DAVID
               I'm freezing.

     He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and
     gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is
     excited, even euphoric.

                         DAVID
               Alex, I've lost my mind.  I
               woke up at the zoo!  But you
               know what?  I feel terrific!

                         ALEX
               The zoo?

                         DAVID
               Waking up at the zoo, that's
               not so insane.  Having no
               clothes on?  That's insane.
               What did I do last night,
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Don't you remember?

                         DAVID
               I said goodbye to you.  I was
               locked out of the flat.  I
               climbed the wall and came in
               through the bathroom window.
               I started to read and then I
               was naked at the zoo!
                    (big smile)
               I guess I am out of my fucking
               mind.

     Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his
     shoulders.

                         ALEX
               I worried about you.  We
               didn't know where you were.

     David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back
     with equal passion.

                         ALEX
               Where did you get that coat?

     David laughs.

73   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE

     Dr. Hirsch is dialing the phone.

74   INT. ALEX'S FLAT

     The phone rings.

                         ALEX
               I'll get it.

     Alex goes to the phone.

                         ALEX
               Hello?

     The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and
     Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, have you heard anything?

     Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her.
                         ALEX
               He's here.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (excited)
               Is he all right?  Why didn't
               you call me?  Where was he?

                         ALEX
               He doesn't remember.  He woke
               up at the zoo.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The zoo?  Is he rational?

                         ALEX
               Yes, he is.  He's very excited
               and confused, but he's not
               crazy, if that's what you
               mean.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Have you read the papers
               today?  Have you listened to
               the radio or television?

                         ALEX
               No, why?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is David acting strangely?

                         ALEX
               No, not really.

     Dr. Hirsch considers.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Could you get here without any
               trouble?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think so.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Right.  Now listen carefully.
               I want you to bring David
               here.  I want him in my care.
               I'll notify the police that
               we've found him.  It is
               imperative that you bring him
               straight to the hospital.  Do
               you understand?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're certain he's lucid?
               You won't need any help?

                         ALEX
               He's fine.  We'll come right
               over.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Shall I send a car?

                         ALEX
               No, a cab will be faster.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I expect you shortly.

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then
     dials again.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Scotland Yard?


75   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     Alex and David are walking.

                         ALEX
               The next corner we can get a
               cab.

                         DAVID
                    (grins)
               I should be committed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch will know what to
               do.

                         DAVID
                    (stretches)
               I don't know why I feel so
               good.  I haven't felt this
               good in a long time.

     Alex is signaling for a taxi.

                         DAVID
               My body feels alive, alert.  I
               feel like an athlete.

     A taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door.

                         ALEX
               Get in.

76   INT. TAXI - DAY

               Saint Martin's Hospital.

                         DRIVER
               Right.

     As they drive.

                         DRIVER
               It's like the days of the Mad
               Barber of Fleet Street, isn't
               it?

                         ALEX
               I beg your pardon?

                         DRIVER
               The murders.

                         DAVID
                    (concerned)
               What murders?

                         DRIVER
               Last night.  Haven't you
               heard?  Six people in
               different parts of the city
               mutilated.  A real maniac this
               one.

                         DAVID
               Pull over.

                         ALEX
               But....

                         DAVID
                    (adamant)
               Pull over.

77   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     The cab pulls to the sidewalk.

                         DAVID
               Pay the man.

     David gets out of the cab.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off
     after David.

                         ALEX
               David, what are you doing?

                         DAVID
               Six people mutilated?  It had
               to be me, Alex.

                         ALEX
               David, stop!

     He turns and faces her.

                         DAVID
               I am going to the cops.
               There's a full moon tonight.
               Jack was right.  I....

                         ALEX
                    (angry)
               Jack is dead!

                         DAVID
               Jack is dead.  Look, six
               people have been killed.  I'm
               going to the police.

     David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex
     has to jog to keep up with him.

                         ALEX
               David, please be rational.
               Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

                         DAVID
               Rational!?!  I'm a fucking
               werewolf, for Christ's sake!

     He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.

                         DAVID
               Officer, I killed those people
               last night.

                         BOBBIE
                    (interested)
               You did, did you?

     Alex runs up.

                         ALEX
               He's playing a stupid joke,
               sir.

                         DAVID
                    (dumbfounded)
               What?

                         ALEX
               We had an argument.  He's
               being silly.

                         DAVID
                    (desperate)
               I swear, I don't know this
               girl.

                         BOBBIE
               All right, you two, move
               along.

                         DAVID
               Hey, you asshole!  I want you
               to arrest me!

                         BOBBIE
               There's no call for that kind
               of language.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               Queen Elizabeth is a man!
               Prince Charles is a faggot!
               Winston Churchill was full of
               shit!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing patience)
               Now see here young man.

                         DAVID
               Shakespeare was French!  The
               Queen Mother sucks cocks in
               hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss!

     The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians
     start to gather.

                         BOBBIE
               That's quite enough!

                         ALEX
                    (pleading)
               David, please!

                         DAVID
               Who is this girl?

                         BOBBIE
               You're going to have to stop
               this disturbance or I shall
               arrest you.

                         DAVID
                    (frustrated, yelling)
               That's what I want you to do,
               you moron!

                         ALEX
                    (to Bobbie)
               Sir, he's very upset.  His
               friend was killed and....

                         DAVID
               Will you shut up!?!!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing his temper)
               That's enough!  Now go about
               your business.

                         ALEX
               Yes, David, let's go.

                         DAVID
                    (disbelief)
               You're not going to arrest me?

     David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.

                         DAVID
               Don't you think he should
               arrest me?
                         ONLOOKER
               Well, I'm not sure.  How does
               he know this isn't a prank?

                         DAVID
                    (despair)
               A prank?

                         ALEX
                    (urgently)
               David....

     The Bobbie has lost all patience.

                         BOBBIE
               I've no time for this
               foolishness.
                    (to onlookers)
               Nothing to look at.  Move
               along.

     The Bobbie walks away.  David is beside himself.

                         DAVID
               Hopeless.  It's hopeless.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               David, let's go now.

     David turns in a rage.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone, dammit!  You
               people are crazy!  I've got to
               get away from here!  I've got
               to do something!

                         ALEX
                    (worried)
               David, don't lose control.

                         DAVID
                    (approaching, hysteria)
               Control!?!  What control!?!
               Get away from me!

     He begins to cry.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone!

     He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their
     brakes, just missing him.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     It's too late.  He's lost in traffic.  Alex stands for
     a moment not knowing which way to turn.

78   EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     David is running in panic.  He finally comes to rest in
     an alley.  He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.

79   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk.
     Dr. Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               The forensic lads seem to feel
               that some sort of animal was
               involved, that's true, but I
               hardly think....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               Regardless of what you think,
               Lieutenant, the fact remains
               that David is missing and that
               we must find him.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Before nightfall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Precisely.

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (harried)
               Gentlemen, please.  We shall
               find Mr. Kessler as quickly as
               we're able.

                         ALEX
               He tried to have himself
               arrested.  He....

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (interrupts)
               Getting arrested isn't all
               that difficult, Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               He wants help.  He....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               What can we do to assist you?

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (rising)
               Stay here.  If we need you,
               we'll know where to reach you.

     He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               I cannot accept a connection
               between David Kessler and last
               night's murders.  We will find
               him, however.  I can assure
               you of that.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We'll find him, not to worry.

     The two policemen exit.  Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex.

                         ALEX
                    (distraught)
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (comforting)
               Tea would be nice.

80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY

     David is in a telephone booth.

                         DAVID
               Yes, operator.  I'd like to
               call the United States and
               reverse the charges.  David
               Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll
               wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code
               315/472-3402.  Thank you.
                    (pause)
               Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes,
               you'll accept the charges.
               Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom
               or Dad home?  Where are they?
               Where's Max?  You're all
               alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't
               leave me alone when I was ten.
               No, not ten and a half either.
               I'm still in London.  I'm all
               better.  Look, would you tell
               Mom and Dad that I love them?
               I don't care, Rachel, just do
               it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And,
               Rachel, don't fight with Max.
               Well, try.  Look, kid, please
               don't forget to tell Mom and
               Dad I love them.  I love Max
               and you, too.  Well, I do.
               No, I'm not being weird, you
               little creep.  You promise?
               Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love
               you.  Bye.

     He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth
     he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then
     catches sight of something.

81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.

     There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's
     pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
     revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack
     points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles,
     walks across the intersection, and up to the box
     office.

                         TICKET LADY
               Two and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's
     checks.

                         DAVID
               Will you take a traveler's
               check?

                         TICKET LADY
               No, sorry.

     David signs a $100 check and hands it to her.

                         DAVID
               Keep the change.

                         TICKET LADY
               Well, thank you, sir!

     She gives him a ticket.  David goes in.

82   INT. CINEMA - DAY

     A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small
     theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide-
     eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the
     last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David
     goes and sits next to him.

                         DAVID
               Hi, Jack.

                         JACK
               Hi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.

                         DAVID
               What can I say, Jack?

                         JACK
               You don't have to say
               anything.

                         DAVID
               Aren't you going to say, `I
               told you so'?

                         JACK
               If I was still alive, I
               probably would.

                         DAVID
               You look awful.

                         JACK
               Thank you.

                         DAVID
                    (apologizes quickly)
               I didn't mean it.  I don't
               know what I'm saying.  I'm not
               even sure it was me who killed
               those people.  I don't
               remember doing it.

                         JACK
               What about the zoo?

                         DAVID
               Well, even if I'm not the
               wolfman, I am crazy enough to
               do something like that.  I
               mean, here I sit in Leicester
               Square talking to a corpse.
               I'm glad to see you, Jack.

                         JACK
               I want you to meet some
               people.

     Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
     BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.

                         JACK
               David Kessler, this is Gerald
               Bringsly.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Gerald is the man you murdered
               in the subway.  We thought it
               best you didn't see him as
               he's a fresh kill and still
               pretty messy.

                         BRINGSLY
                    (in shadow; very English)
               Yes, I do look most
               unpleasant.

     The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from
     the seat to a puddle on the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               Why are you doing this to me,
               Jack?

                         BRINGSLY
               This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
               He is your good friend,
               whereas I am a victim of your
               carnivorous lunar activities.

                         DAVID
                    (appalled)
               Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I
               have absolutely no idea what
               to say to you.

                         BRINGSLY
               You've left my wife a widow
               and my children fatherless.
               And I understand that I am to
               walk the earth one of the
               living dead until the wolf's
               bloodline is severed and the
               curse lifted.

     Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
     glistens.

                         BRINGSLY
               You must die, David Kessler.

                         JACK
               David, this is Harry Berman
               and his fiancee Judith Browns.

     The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
     Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one
     arm missing.

                         JACK
               And these gentlemen are Alf,
               Ted, and Joseph.

     The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All
     are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen
     illuminating their gore.

                         DERELICT #2
               Can't say we're pleased to
               meet you, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
                    (defeated)
               What shall I do?

                         JACK
               Suicide.

                         HARRY
                    (adamantly)
               You must take your own life!

                         DAVID
               That's easy for you to say -
               you're already dead.

                         BRINGSLY
               No, David.  Harry and I and
               everyone you murder are not
               dead.  The undead.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Why are you doing this to me?

                         JACK
               Because this must be stopped.

                         DAVID
               How shall I do it?

                         JUDITH
               Sleeping pills?

                         DERELICT #1
               Not sure enough.

                         DAVID
               I could hang myself.

                         JACK
               If you did it wrong, it would
               be painful.  You'd choke to
               death.

                         DERELICT #3
               So what?  Let `im choke.

                         JACK
               Do you mind?  The man's a
               friend of mine.

                         DERELICT #3
               Well he ain't no friend of
               mine.

                         BRINGSLY
               Gentlemen, please.

                         HARRY
               A gun.

                         DERELICT #1
               I know where he can get a gun.

                         DAVID
               Don't I need a silver bullet
               or something?

                         JACK
               Be serious, would you?

     David puts his head in his hands.

                         DAVID
               Madness.  I've gone totally
               mad.

                         HARRY
               A gun is good.

                         JUDITH
               You just put the gun to your
               forehead and pull the trigger.

                         BRINGSLY
               If you put it in your mouth,
               then you'd be sure not to
               miss.

                         DAVID
               Thank you, you're all so
               thoughtful.

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back
     from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head
     suddenly.


                                                  CUT TO:

83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT

     The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up.

84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three
     small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle
     staring at him.

                         DAVID
                    (gasps out in anguish)
               Go away!  Please!  Go away!

     The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow
     more severe.

                         DAVID
                    (his face contorting)
               Run!  Please...run.

     His hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick
     hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in
     fascination.

85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The
     TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:
                         TICKET TAKER
               I'll check on the house.

     He goes inside the theater.

86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie
     continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He
     cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something
     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!

                                                  CUT TO:

87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

     From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and
     single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema
     through the busy traffic.

88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

                         TICKET LADY
               It's horrible, horrible!
               There's a beast!  A mad dog!
               It's killing people in there!

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.

89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the
     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes
     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly
     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its
     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,
     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.

90   EXT. CINEMA

     As the cop bolts the door shut.

                         COP #1
               For God's sake, Tom, there's a
               monster in there!
     The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them
     down.  The cops strain to keep them shut.

                         COP #1
               Call for assistance and tell
               them to bring guns.

     Pedestrians start milling around.  The door is bulging.
     The Wolf's roars continue.

                         COP #2
               Keep moving!  Will you people
               get out of the way!

91   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep.  Dr. Hirsch wakes her.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nurse Hobbs said there's a
               disturbance in Leicester
               Square involving some sort of
               mad dog.

                         ALEX
               David?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I doubt it.  But it's
               something to do.

92   INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are
     distributed to uniformed men.

93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are
     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door
     closed against the Wolf's battering.

     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers
     and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               What the hell is going on
               here?

                         COP
               It's some kind of animal, sir.
               We....
     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the
     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders
     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.

     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops
     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf
     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly
     barricade the entrance to the alley.

94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
     Square.  Police vehicles roar past.

                         ALEX
               David!  It's David!

     She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her.


95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

     The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the
     alley.  Alex runs to them.

                         ALEX
               Let me through!

                         COP
               Stand clear, miss!

                         ALEX
               I must get through!

     Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley.  The
     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the
     police line.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex!

     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.

                         ALEX
               David?  Is it you?  Is it
               true, David?

     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the
     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.

                         ALEX
               David?

     THE WOLF REARS UP.  In that brief instant, Alex
     realizes it will kill her.

                         OFFICER
               Fire!

     The guns blaze.  The Wolf falls dead.  Alex leans on
     the wall, numb.  The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus
     run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and
     riddled with bullets.  Alex begins to weep.

          SCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is
          open.
                         
          The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
          clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several
          firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all
          wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.
          Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their
          way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,
          the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
          flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the superintendent and the
                          NEIGHBOR)
           Wait Outside please.
                         
          He signals to a police officer who herds the curious
          onlookers back out through the door.
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER
           (to the superintendent, pointing to
           a pile of mail)
           What's the date of the last letter?
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
                          (VERIFYING)
           The 16th from what I can see...
           Wait...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the
          door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the fire officer)
           Can you try?
                         
          While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes
          detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the
          windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
          the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped
          up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,
          where he also opens up the windows...
                         
           FIREMAN (O.S.)
           The door is open.
                         
          ...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting
          firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the
          police officer and the janitor.
           2.
                         
                         
                          JANITOR
           ...no as far as I know. During the
           whole time, they had a nurse, but
           it's been a while since I last saw
           her. My wife has been...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now
          accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the
          curtains billow into the room.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the firemen who are now curious
           enough to come and stand by the
                          DOOR)
           Did you open the windows?
                         
          The firemen shake their heads.
                         
          The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
          placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
          hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand
          bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where
          once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The
          corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
          that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a
          crucifix.

          SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
                         
          All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and
          ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go
          to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once
          everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking
          people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught
          with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the
          lights go out. APPLAUSE.
                         
          Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS
          ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.
                         
                         
          SCENE 4 - INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded
          by admirers who congratulate him.
                         
          Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the
          soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most
          of the others).
           3.
                         
                         
          When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group
          of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly,
          visibly glad to see them.
                         
                         
          SCENE 5 - INT. BUS - NIGHT
                         
          Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.
                         
          Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty
          bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from
          time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed
          and happy.
                         
          SCENE 6 - INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the
          outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.
                         
          Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the
          open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an
          attempted forced entry.
                         
          Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
          grooves.
                         
                          GEORGES
           They used a screwdriver or
           something like that...it doesn't
           look very professional...
                         
                          ANNE
           But who would do something like
           that?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No idea. Why do people break in?
           Because they want to steal
           something.
                         
                          ANNE
           From us?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (laughs briefly out loud)
           Hey, why not? If I thought about
           it, I could come up with at least
           three or four people we know who've
           been burgled.
                         
          After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the
          double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.
           4.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           What time is it? Can't we call the
           superintendent?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'll do that tomorrow morning.
           Anyway, they didn't see anything.
                         
          He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet
          in the hallway.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Don't let it spoil your good mood
           now.
                         
                          ANNE
           Or the police?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Come on, give me your coat.
                         
          She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with
          his in the closet.
                         
                          ANNE
           Imagine if we were here, in our
           beds, and someone broke in.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Why should I imagine that?
                         
                          ANNE
           But it's terrible! I think I'd die
           of fright.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (LAUGHING)
           So would I.
                         
          He undoes his shoes.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Shall we have a drink?
                         
                          ANNE
           I'm tired.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I still fancy a drink.
                         
          He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his
          slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom.
           5.
                         
                         
           ANNE (O.S.)
           Go ahead then. Mathilde told me
           that in her building, the attic
           apartment was burgled from the
           loft. They just knocked a hole in
           the wall, cut out all of the
           valuable pictures from their frames
           and disappeared without a trace.
                         
          He goes toward the kitchen.
                         
                          GEORGES
           They must have been professionals.
                         
          As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears
          to be looking at Anne.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Did I tell you, you looked good
           tonight?
                         
          SHORT PAUSE. THEN:
                         
           ANNE (O.S.)
                          (FLATTERED)
           What's got into you?
                         
          With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen,
          where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND,
          apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short
                         PAUSE:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Weren't those semiquavers in the
           presto incredible? What staccato!
           Don't you agree?
                         
          Short PAUSE.
                         
           GEORGES (O.S.)
           You're proud of him, huh?
                         
          SCENE 7 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then
          raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against
          the headboard.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Something wrong?
                         
                          ANNE
           No.
           6.
                         
                         
          After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to
          the next scene.
                         
          SCENE 8 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS.
                         
          Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is
          half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear
          and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up
          from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas,
          takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under
          cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (on the phone)
           What about next week? No but still,
           it would make sense to get it done
           soon. It might give people silly
           ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to
           look at... Wednesday? What time?
           OK... Will you bring the paint with
           you too, to paint over it? But at
           least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank
           you.
                         
          He hangs up.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                          (TO ANNE)
           You can depend on that guy.
                         
                          ANNE
           (who comes back to the table with
           the egg) I hope so. The last time,
           he kept us waiting for ages, if you
           remember.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (laughs while acquiescing)
           Yes, that's true. (Reacting when
           she places the egg in his egg cup)
           Thanks. If I call a regular
           professional, we'll still be
           waiting two months time.
                         
                          ANNE
           (more to herself)
           Really?
                         
          She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his
          egg, puts salt on it, eats.
           7.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           The Frodons waited three days when
           their toilet was blocked. Not
           exactly pleasant.
                         
          He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is
          empty.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           The saltcellar is empty.
                         
          He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal
          with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the
          inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself,
          heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I don't know if he's going to bring
           us the CD. Maybe he won't come at
           all. In any case, he didn't mention
           it. I'd like to buy it. It was
           really good and I don't want to
           wait long for it. We could go to
           Virgin this afternoon and buy it.
           What do you say?
                         
          He comes back to the table and sits down again.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?
                         
          She looks at him and doesn't answer.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           What's going on? What's the matter?
                         
          He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!
                         
          She continues to look at him without reacting.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (serious now) Anne! What's going
           on?
                         
          He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly,
          leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her
          turn toward him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne, what's the matter?
           8.
                         
                         
          He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but
          her eyes look through him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne...what's...
                         
          He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne...
                         
          She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits
          beside her, for quite awhile.
                         
                         SILENCE
                         
          Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap,
          wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and
          places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't
          come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
          applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her
          imploringly.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (close to tears)
           Anne...Darling...please!
                         
          Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we
          hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has
          forgotten to turn it off.
                         
          Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the
          hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
          agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly,
          the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far
          as the bedroom.
                         
          George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne?
                         
          Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen.
                         
          Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.
                         
                          ANNE
           What are you doing?
                         
          She turns toward the breakfast.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           You left the water running.
           9.
                         
                         
          Georges stares at her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (both aghast and furious)
           Hey, what's going on? Are you
           completely crazy? Is this supposed
           to be a joke, or what's going on?
                         
          She looks at him with amazement.
                         
                          ANNE
           What did you say?
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (SERIOUSLY)
           Is this a joke? Is this meant to be
           a joke?
                         
                          ANNE
           What joke? I don't get it! Why are
           you talking to me like that? What's
           got into you?
                         
          Georges comes from the door to the table.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's
           not funny.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (GETTING IRRITATED)
           What game, for Christ's sake? What
           on earth's the matter?!!
                         
          Georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone,
          but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. He
          tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside
          Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesn't know how
          to react.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What's the matter? Why didn't you
           react?
                         
                          ANNE
           To what?
                         
                          GEORGES
           To what? To me, to everything.
                         
                          ANNE
           When?
           10.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Just now. A moment ago.
                         
                          ANNE
           Please tell me what's wrong. What
           am I supposed to have done?
                         
          Georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne. He
          doesn't want to believe that its serious.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't know what to say. Do you
           really not know what just happened?
                         
                          ANNE
           But what DID happen?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (almost reluctantly bowing his head
           as he speaks) You were sitting
           there, staring at me. You didn't
           answer me when I asked you what the
           matter was.
                         
          He picks up the wet tea towel from the table.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I put this tea towel on your face,
           and you didn't react.
                         
          Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her
          head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at
          her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Look... There's still dampness on
           your collar.
                         
          Anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the
          damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry.
                         
                          ANNE
           When... When was it?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Just now, a few minutes ago.
                         
                          ANNE
           So...??
                         
                          GEORGES
           There's no "So". I went into the
           bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to
           get help.
           11.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           Help?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, and then you turned off the
           tap.
                         
                          ANNE
           Yes. Because you left it on.
                         
                         SILENCE
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           I don't understand.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Neither do I.
                         
          PAUSE.

           Don't you think it's best if I call
           Dr. Bertier?
                         
                          ANNE
           Why? What can he do?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't know. Examine you.
                         
                          ANNE
           I'm fine. There's nothing wrong
           with me.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne, please!! That's absurd. We
           can't pretend that nothing
           happened.
                         
                          ANNE

           I'm here. I'm having my breakfast,
           and you're telling me things
           happened that I don't understand.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Can you explain how the tea towel
           got there?
           12.

                          (IRRITATED)
           No, I can't!
                         
                          GEORGES
           Who turned on the tap?
                         
                          ANNE
           You did!
                         
                          GEORGES
           Can you remember that?
                         
                          ANNE
           (more and more desperate, close to
           tears) No I can't! Do you want to
           torture me? Leave me in peace!
                         
          Georges looks at her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Don't you think it would be better
           to fetch Dr. Bertier?
                         
                          ANNE
           No!
                         
          She takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and
          drinks it up. When she wants to re-fill her cup, she
          completely misses her aim. She notices it, puts down her cup
          and bursts into tears.

          We see wide shots of the apartment. The hallway. The bedroom.
          The living room. The dining room. The kitchen. Nobody in

           You know how he is. Once he's got
           something into his head, he has to
           go through with it. In the end,
           everybody was delighted. And
           besides, it didn't hurt our
           financial situation. We're playing
           until the 28th.

           Then we have 10 days to rest, then
           we go to Stockholm for four days,
           and then to Kumo in Finland. Heaven
           knows where that is. At the North
           Pole. But Geoff's already been
           there few times, and he loves it.
           We're playing the "Dowland
           Transcriptions" there and then
           we're back in London.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What about the children?
                         
                          EVA
           Liz is at boarding school and John
           is living his own life. He's twenty-
           six years old.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What does he do?
                         
                          EVA
           He's a student. We rarely see him.
           He's got his own ideas. Life Geoff.
           They don't really get along. Geoff
           wants to advise him on everything,
           and John doesn't like that at all.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Is he good?
                         
                          EVA
           I think so. He's less impulsive.
           Very industrious.
                         
                          GEORGES
           That sounds rather derogatory.
                         
                          EVA
           No!! He's not like Geoff. Quiet,
           but stubborn. I think he'll do all
           right. At the last Conservatory
           concert, he played the solo part in
           the Haydn Concerto. It was very
           good. Geoff was there and
           congratulated him at the end.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.

           (with a little laugh)
           My God, you know him, don't you?
           Over the winter, he suddenly
           discovered his passion for a viola
           player who'd been in our ensemble
           for years. What can I tell you? It
           was a huge drama, and the poor
           little darling wound up trying to
           commit suicide. That scared him and
           he came back to me in full remorse.
           I've got used to it now. What's a
           bit embarrassing is that the
           ensemble, you can't keep any
           secrets from anyone.

           What can I say? The carotid artery
           was blocked. They did an ultrasound
           scan, two in fact, and they said
           they had to operate on her. She was
           scared. She was confused and
           scared. You know she has always
           been afraid of doctors. They said
           the risk was very low and that if
           they didn't operate, she'd be
           certain to have a serious stroke.
                         
                          EVA

                          GEORGES
           Just that it didn't go well. It's
           one of the 5% that go wrong.

                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           No, really. There's nothing you can
           do. We'll see how things go when
           she's back here in the apartment.
           We'll manage. Maybe I'll get a
           caretaker in, or maybe I'll manage
           on my own. We'll see. We've been
           through quite a lot in our time,
           your mother and I.
                          (LITTLE LAUGH)

           It's funny. I don't know if I
           should say it. Maybe it'll
           embarrass you. But when I came here
           a short while ago, I suddenly
           remembered how I always used to
           listen to the two of you making
           love when I was little.

           For me, at the time, it was
           reassuring. It gave me a feeling
           that you loved each other, and that

          The door of the apartment is opened. Georges comes in. Behind
          him is Anne in a wheelchair, pushed by a paramedic. A second
          paramedic (as young as the first) follows with a suitcase and
          a large bag. Behind them, the superintendent.
                         
          Georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible. He
          stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first
          paramedic.

           both of you. You can just put the
           things down here. There, beside the
           window, right. We'll be okay on our
           own. Thanks a lot.
                         
          The two paramedics exchange a brief glance, say thanks, and
          leave the apartment, passing the superintendent as they go.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (to the superintendent)
           Thank you, Mr. Mery.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           If you need anything, just call
           downstairs. If we can help at
           all...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Right now everything's fine. I'll
           let your wife know as soon as we
           need anything.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
                          (TO ANNE)
           It's nice to have you back, Mrs.
           Laurent.
                         
                          ANNE
           Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mery. Thank
           you.
           17.
                         
                         
          The superintendent hesitates another moment.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Yes, thanks.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Yes... So... Goodbye then, ma'am.
           Welcome home again. Goodbye, Sir.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Goodbye, Mr. Mery.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Goodbye.
                         
          He leaves the apartment.
                         
          There is a brief moment of perplexity. Then Georges says:
                         
                          GEORGES
           (with a nervous smile)
           Where do you want...
                         
                          ANNE
           In the living room.
                         
          Georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around
          the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the
          wheelchair and pushes Anne into the LIVING ROOM.
                         
          The doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes
          through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the
          armchairs and then steps in front of her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Shall I make some tea?
                         
                          ANNE
           (with a faint smile)
           First come sit with me.
                         
          George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a
          clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Can you help me into the chair?
                         
          Georges stands back up.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (EAGERLY)
           Of course.
           18.
                         
                         
          He extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts
          the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from
          the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
          to Georges.
                         
                          ANNE
           It's best if you put my arm around
           your neck and your right arm around
           me, that way it'll be easy.
                         
          He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together
          the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he
          lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because
          they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward
          and clumsy.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Thanks.
                         
          He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "Don't
          mention it". Then he sits down opposite her.
                         
          LONG PAUSE.
                         
          At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the
          fact that words do not come easily. After a long while,
          during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC
          below.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (softly almost to himself)
           I'm glad you're back.
                         
                          ANNE
           (in a voice just as soft)
           Me too.
                         
          Another PAUSE. Then Anne says:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Promise me one thing.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What?
                         
                          ANNE
           Please never take me back to the
           hospital.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What?
                         
          PAUSE.
           19.
                         
                         
          She looks at him. He has understood.
                         
                          ANNE
           You promise?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne...
                         
                          ANNE
           You promise?
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne, I...
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't talk right now. And don't
           give me any lectures. Please.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What can I say, it's...
                         
                          ANNE
                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)
           Nothing. Just don't say anything.
           OK?!
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
          SCENE 13 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          He helps her into bed, then throws the blanket over her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           There.
                         
                          ANNE
           Thank you. Thank you, Darling.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Everything OK?
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SMILING)
           Everything's fine.
                         
          He hesitates.
           20.
                         
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           You don't have to hold my hand all
           the time now. I can look after
           myself, you know.
                         
          He nods.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           And don't feel guilty. That would
           be pointless. And a drag. For me
           too.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't feel guilty.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's good.
                         
          She smiles.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Go over there now. I'm not a
           cripple. You can easily leave me
           alone for two minutes. I won't
           collapse.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (with a slight smile)
           OK.
                         
                          ANNE
           Did you buy the new book on
           Harnoncourt?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I've already read it.
                         
                          ANNE
           And?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Do you want it? I'll get it for
           you.
                         
                          ANNE
           Sure.
                         
          He goes out of the room to fetch the book. She remains lying
          there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her
          hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the
          blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a
          while, we hear Georges shouting.
           21.
                         
                         
           GEORGES (O.S.)
           I don't know where I put it.
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't worry. It isn't that
           important.
                         
           GEORGES (O.S.)
           Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in
           the... Just a moment! Viola! Here
           you are! Nothing like an infallible
           memory!
                         
          She smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book
          in his hand.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I thought I'd left it over there in
           the other room, but I'd already put
           it away. Tidy people just can't
           help being tidy.
                         
                          ANNE
           (taking the book)
           Thanks.
                         
          She puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Right now, take care of yourself.
           And don't wait to see how I hold
           the book in my hand, OK?
                         
                          GEORGES
           OK.
                         
          He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom.
          She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she
          remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries
          to open it. It's not easy for her.
                         
          Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests
          the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on
          the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens
          the book again, and tries to read.
                         
          SCENE 14 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on
          the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top
          of one of the bags and puts it down beside them. Then she
          takes out the receipt and the change.
           22.
                         
                         
                          SUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE
           Unfortunately the strawberries were
           already moldy. I'll go and get you
           some fresh ones tomorrow from the
           market. My husband will bring you
           the bottled water this afternoon.
           I'm not supposed to carry anything
           heavy: my back, you know...
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Sure, no problem.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           It came to 76 euros and 40 cents.
           There's the till receipt and here's
           your change: 23 euros 60.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Thank you very much. Keep the
           change. Thanks.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          Short embarrassed PAUSE.
                         
           SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)
           Well, I'll be off. Call me if you
           need anything else.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes. I will.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Is your wife well? ...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, she's OK. She's recovering.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Fine. Give her my regards. My
           husband and I are very glad she's
           back.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, we are too. Bye, Mrs. Méry,
           thanks so much.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE
           Goodbye, sir.
                         
          She heads toward the front door of the apartment, turns
          around again toward Georges.
           23.
                         
                         
           SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)
           I'll bring you the strawberries
           tomorrow around noon, if that suits
           you.
                         
          He nods, she closes the door as she leaves.
                         
          SCENE 15 - INT. HALLWAY - TOILET - DAY
                         
          He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet, waiting.
          After a while, we hear the noise of flushing. After a while
          longer, we hear
                         
           ANNE (O.S.)
           There. Can you come in, please?
                         
          He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she
          puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that
          way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt. Then they slowly
          hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the
          wheelchair.
                         
          SCENE 16 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are both lying in their beds. Anne sleeps, BREATHING
          NOISILY. Georges lies with his eyes open, listening
          attentively to her breathing.
                         
          SCENE 17 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The sun shines in. Georges has cooked something simple. They
          are both in a good mood, eating and drinking.
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... some banal romance or other
           about a nobleman and a lower middle-
           class girl who couldn't have each
           other and who then, out of sheer
           magnanimity, decide to renounce
           their love - in fact I don't quite
           remember it any more. In any case,
           afterwards I was thoroughly
           distraught, and it took me a bit of
           time to calm down. In the courtyard
           of the house where grandma lived,
           there was a young guy at the window
           who asked me where I'd been. He was
           a couple of years older than me, a
           braggart who of course really
           impressed me. "To the movies", I
           said, because I was proud that my
           grandma had given me the money to
           go all alone to the cinema.
                          (MORE)
           24.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           "What did you see?" I started to
           tell him the story of the movie,
           and as I did, all the emotion came
           back. I didn't want to cry in front
           of the boy, but it was impossible;
           there I was, crying out loud in the
           courtyard, and I told him the whole
           drama to the bitter end.
                         
                          ANNE
           So? How did he react?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No idea. He probably found it
           amusing. I don't remember. I don't
           remember the film either. But I
           remember the feeling. That I was
           ashamed of crying, but that telling
           him the story made all my feelings
           and tears come back, almost more
           powerfully than when I was actually
           watching the film, and that I just
           couldn't stop.
                         
          She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's cute. Why didn't you ever
           tell me before?
                         
                          GEORGES
           There are still a few stories you
           don't know.
                         
                          ANNE
           Aha...? Don't tell me you're going
           to ruin your image in your old age?
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (GRINNING)
           You bet I won't. But what is my
           image?
                         
          She takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. Then she looks at
          him.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (TENDERLY)
           Sometimes you're a rotter. But
           you're nice.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (EMBARRASSED GRIN)
           Can I take you for a drink?
           25.
                         
                         
          She laughs.
                         
          SCENE 18 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          He does physiotherapy exercises with her. Counts the
          repetitive movements of the exercises.
                         
          SCENE 19 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          She's lying on the sofa. He's seated in the armchair. They're
          both reading the newspaper. After a while:
                         
                          ANNE
           Listen to this! My horoscope.

          PAUSE. Then
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (GOOD-HUMORED)
           You've only yourself to blame if
           you read stuff like that.
                         
          Brief PAUSE. Then:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's
           funeral.
                         
                          ANNE
           You have to go.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I fear I must. I don't want to go
           at all.
                         
                          ANNE
           Who does like going to funerals?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Oh, I know a few people who do.
           Annette can never wait to get all
           dolled up again. And François
           has...
           26.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           You're mean. What would you say if
           no one came to your funeral?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (dryly) Nothing, presumably.
                         
          She shoots him a glance, smiles at his irony. Then she says:
                         
                          ANNE
           Have you talked to Jeanne since I
           was in the hospital? I mean, does
           she know I can't come?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Of course.
                         
                          ANNE
           What did she say?
                         
                          GEORGES
           She was shocked.
                         
                          ANNE
           How?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (a bit irritated)
           My God, what are people like when
           they're shocked? She couldn't
           believe it, she was speechless. I
           don't remember any more. In any
           case, not exactly. I've spoken to a
           lot of people since.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           Sorry.
                         
                          GEORGES
           No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be
           unkind, but I just don't see the
           point of talking about it all the
           time.
                         
          Short PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           Do I talk about it all the time?
           27.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           No. Sorry.
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't worry.
                         
          SCENE 20 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          The front door is unlocked from the outside, and Georges
          enters. He's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion.
          He turns on the light. He's wet. Clearly, it's been raining.
          As he closes the door again, his eyes fall on Anne. With her
          back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the
          opened window of the light well, half propped against her
          wheelchair.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What ... ?!
                         
          Shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in
          the wheelchair. Outside, in the light well, it is raining.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           (once she's seated in the
                          WHEELCHAIR)
           Why are you back already? What time
           is it?
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
          Georges has understood immediately. He closes the window
          noiselessly.
                         
          Then just stands there, at a loss.
                         
          SILENCE. Then
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
                          (SOFTLY)
           Forgive me, I was too slow.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne...
                         
                          ANNE
           Can you wheel me into the living
           room?
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes.
           28.
                         
                         
          He turns toward her, pushes the wheelchair into the living
          room between the two armchairs. Turns on the light. Stops
          beside the switch. They both look exhausted.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           You're always good at surprises.
                         
                          ANNE
           Yes. Why are you home earlier?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I didn't come home earlier. I took
           a taxi. In August, there isn't a
           lot of traffic.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's true. How was the funeral?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne...!
                         
                          ANNE
           How was it, go on, tell me!
                         
          He thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in
          an armchair. Looks at her. She raises her head and returns
          his look. He understands that he can't insist right now. Long
          PAUSE. Then he begins:
                         
                          GEORGES
           It was rather bizarre. The priest
           was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's
           co-workers made a speech that was
           embarrassingly emotional. His old
           secretary came with a radio-
           cassette player and after the
           speech she put on "Yesterday" by
           the Beatles. You can't imagine.
           Everybody turned round to look at
           her. Apparently, it wasn't planned.
           His grandchildren were there. Of
           course they giggled as soon as the
           music began. Then the urn was put
           on a huge stretcher that was
           obviously designed for a coffin,
           and out we went into the rain. They
           placed the urn on a small electric
           cart that crawled along for what
           seemed like an eternity to the tiny
           hole they had dug. A lot of people
           had to stifle their laughter. It
           must have been terrible for Jeanne.
           I have...
           29.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)
           There's just no point in going on
           living. I know it can only get
           worse. Why should I inflict it on
           us? On you and me.
                         
                          GEORGES
           You're not inflicting anything on
           me.
                         
                          ANNE
           You don't have to lie, Georges.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Imagine you were me. Didn't you
           ever think something like this
           could happen to one of us?
                         
                          ANNE
           Of course I did. But imagination
           and reality have little in common.
                         
                          GEORGES
           But things are getting better every
           day. We'll...
                         
                          ANNE
                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)
           Georges, I don't want to carry on.
           You're making such efforts to make
           everything easier for me. But I
           don't want to go on. For my own
           sake. Not yours.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't believe you. I know you.
           You think you're a burden on me.
           But what if things were the other
           way around? What would you do then?
                         
                          ANNE
           I don't know. I can't be bothered
           to think about being you. I'm
           tired. You tire me. Everything
           tires me. I can't talk. I want to
           go to bed.
                         
          He looks at her. Finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair
          out of frame.
                         
          SCENE 21 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
           30.
                         
                         
          She is lying in bed. The bedside lamp is on.
                         
          We hear the RADIO coming from the living room: a program
          about the fauna and flora of the South Seas, or something
          similar.
                         
          SCENE 22 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door. On
          the doorstep stands the soloist (male or female) from Scenes
          3 and 4.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (somewhat perplexed, but pleased)
           Oh hello! Nice to see you.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Forgive me for dropping in on you
           like this, Professor. I tried to
           reach you by phone a couple of
           times, but no luck.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone
           when I've stored the caller's
           number and I can see who's calling.
           Why didn't you leave a message?
           Anyway, do come in...
                         
          He closes the door behind his guest.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           I just couldn't manage to come by
           after the concert. I was so sorry,
           because I was so pleased you came
           along.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Come with me.
                         
          While they pass into the living room, they continue to speak:
                         
                          SOLOIST
           ... And now, an unexpected
           opportunity has arisen because
           François Mitry called me - you know
           him, he's my agent - to say he'd
           arranged for me to meet the boss of
           the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées
           tonight to talk about their new
           concert series.
                          (MORE)
           31.
                         
                          SOLOIST (CONT'D)
           So I flew to Paris this morning,
           and while I was in my hotel, I
           thought, I'll just give it a try
           and drop in. After all, it's
           virtually just around the corner.
                         
          Sorry, these are for your wife.
                         
          He takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and
          hands it to Georges.
                         
                          SOLOIST (CONT'D)
           Isn't she at home?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, she is. I'll go and get her in
           a minute. Have a seat.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           I hope I'm not disturbing you too
           much.
                         
                          GEORGES
           No, not at all. I'm happy that you
           came. We were so thrilled by your
           concert. We hoped we'd see you
           again soon. Please do have a seat.
           Can I can get you something? A cup
           of tea?
                         
                          SOLOIST
           No, no, thank you very much.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Hold on, I'll just freshen up the
           flowers; in this heat they wilt so
           fast...
                         
                          SOLOIST
           I've only just bought them. They
           should keep quite...
                         
                         
                         
          But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and
          closed the door behind him. The soloist looks around him.
                         
          After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in
          the distance, without understanding what they're saying. It
          lasts a while.
                         
          Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her
          wheelchair, into the living room.
           32.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           Martin! What a delight. How lovely
           to see you!
                         
          The (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite
          know how to handle the situation.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Mrs. Laurent! Lovely to see you
           too.
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself
           down and don't look so shocked.
                         
          The soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the
          wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down.
          Brief embarrassed PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm so proud of you. We were both
           in raptures after your concert.
           Georges wanted to buy your new CD
           the very next morning.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Oh God! I wanted to bring you the
           CD, but I left in such a hurry that
           I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'll get
           one today and drop it by.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SMILING)
           No, no, don't worry. We want to
           make a contribution to your
           success. Even if it's only twenty
           euros.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           You've already contributed so much.
           I owe you so much, Madame.
                         
                          ANNE
           You owe it to your hard work and
           your talent.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           (shaking his head a little) Do you
           remember, when you first gave me
           the Bagatelles to play? I was
           twelve at the time, and in my
           youthful arrogance I said: "But why
           the Bagatelles?" And you really
           gave me a piece of your mind.
           33.
                         
                         
          They both smile. PAUSE. Then he goes on:
                         
                          SOLOIST (CONT'D)
           So what happened?
                         
                          ANNE
           My right side is paralyzed, that's
           all. It can happen when you get
           older.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           And how...?
                         
                          ANNE
           Let's talk about something else,
           shall we?
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (DISCONCERTED)
           Sure ...
                         
                          ANNE
           Don't be offended. But I want to
           enjoy the lovely interlude you've
           given us with your visit.
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (DISARMED)
           Of course.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           You haven't told us yet what's been
           going on since the Paris concert.
                         
          The soloist is a bit thrown by the couple's behavior.
                         
                          SOLOIST
           Well, actually I've spent most of
           the time in London studying. Then I
           went to Copenhagen for two
           performances, that was Schubert
           too. My whole life revolves around
           Schubert at the moment. The
           concerts with the Impromptus and
           the Moments Musicaux, and for my
           bread-and-butter work I'm
           developing the sonatas. Not the
           late ones, I think I still need a
           couple more years for those.
           34.
                         
                         
          (The dialogue concerning music will be modified according to
          the performer chosen.)
                         
                          ANNE
           Could you do me a favor?
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (SURPRISED)
           Really?
                         
                          ANNE
           Would you play Für Elise?
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Um, I don't know if I remember it
           very well. Beethoven, it's been a
           long time since I've... But if you
           want...
                         
                          ANNE
           Give it a try.
                         
                          SOLOIST
                          (HESITANTLY)
           OK.
                         
          He looks at Georges, then at Anne again, gets up, goes to the
          grand piano and plays.
                         
          SCENE 23 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Georges is leaning against the chest, and watches Anne, who
          is practicing maneuvering her new electric wheelchair.
          Forward, backward, turning. In the end, she goes round and
          round in circles several times. He laughs, so does she.
                         
          SCENE 24 - INT. BEDROOM - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Anne is lying in bed. A book rests on her stomach. She
          listens to the PIANO playing coming from the living room.
          After a while the music stops.
                         
                          ANNE
           What's the matter?
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Georges is seated in front of the open piano. His hands in
          his lap, he looks straight ahead.
                         
          SCENE 25 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
           35.
                         
                         
          The superintendent's wife runs the vacuum cleaner over a
          carpet.
                         
          SCENE 26 - INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Anne is seated on a stool. Georges washes her.
                         
          SCENE 27 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
                         
          Georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating. On the
          radio, we hear the EVENING NEWS. Suddenly, coming from the
          neighboring room, a LOUD CRASH and the SOUND of crockery
          breaking. Stifled CRY from Anne. Georges gets up, irritated,
          crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM.
                         
          Anne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in
          the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (shocked, and hence furious)
           Good God, what are you doing?
                         
          He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into
          the bed.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Have you lost your senses?! I don't
           believe it! How stupid!
                         
          He points to the broken objects.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Look at that! Did you need to do
           that? Can't you call me when you
           need something?
                         
                          ANNE
           (meekly) I'm sorry.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (STILL FURIOUS)
           Yes, so am I.
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SOFTLY)
           Sorry.
                         
          Georges bends down, and begins to gather up the scattered
          objects.
                         
                          GEORGES
           The lamp is broken too.
                         
          SCENE 28 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - ANNEX - DAY
           36.
                         
                         
          Bathroom.
                         
          Georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. The
          doorbell rings.
                         
          Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and
          over to the front door.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Yes? Who's there?
                         
          No answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to
                         HIM:
                         
                          ANNE
           Georges? What's going on? Who is
           it?
                         
          Georges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the
          usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without
          a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It
          looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of
          ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other
          end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is
          stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened.
          Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door.
                         
          O.S., in the distance, Anne's worried voice:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Georges? What's going on?
                         
          Georges opens the small door. Behind it is a narrow,
          windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. At the end
          of the corridor, a door. Georges heads toward this door and
          opens it too. Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally
          bright as the others. Everything is very quiet. Georges
          enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor,
          crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the
          hallway of the apartment. But it too is now empty and bright,
          with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the
          bedroom is open. Behind that too, it appears to be empty and
          bright. Georges goes toward it.
                         
          At the same time, we hear GEORGES' VOICE. At first he groans,
          but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder.
          Shortly after, we also hear:
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE:
           Georges, what's going on?
                         
          SCENE 29 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Darkness. GEORGES HOLLERS
           37.
                         
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE
           Calm down will you! There's nothing
           there. It's nothing.
                         
          She manages to switch on the bedside lamp. Georges is sitting
          up in his bed, having just awoken, wide-eyed with terror. His
          breathing is labored.
                         
          Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to
          calm him. He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow.
                         
                          ANNE
           What was it?
                         
          He doesn't answer. Continues breathing heavily. She caresses
          him.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (still with labored breathing)
           I didn't understand... I thought
           I'd gone mad... It was something
           impossible...
                         
                          ANNE
           What was?
                         
          SCENE 30 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Close shot on the screen of a cell phone. We read on it:
                         
          Coming to Paris on 12th. Plan to stop by in afternoon. Hope
          all well. So look forward to seeing you. Love Eva.
                         
          We hear O.S. the voice of
                         
                          GEORGES
           Eva. They're coming on the 12th.
                         
          He crouches down in front of Anne who is seated on the bed,
          puts his mobile phone back in his pocket and continues to put
          on her socks and her shoes.
                         
                          ANNE
           Why?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No idea. Apparently she's coming
           with Geoff.
                         
                          ANNE
           When is it?
           38.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't know exactly. What day is
           it today? I'll go and look.
                         
          Short PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           I don't want that.
                         
                          GEORGES
           What?
                         
                          ANNE
           Geoff doesn't need to come.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
          Georges doesn't agree, but continues to dress Anne.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           I don't need any comments on my
           predicament. I can only take his
           British humor in small doses.
                         
          SCENE 31 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Once more the set of physiotherapy exercises. Things are
          going better. Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing
          her improvement. She reacts like someone duty-bound, but
          without conviction.
                         
          SCENE 32 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Close shot: a CD is inserted into a player. As the MUSIC
          begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card
          out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to
                         ANNE:
                         
                          GEORGES
           Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur
           Laurent, it was beautiful and yet
           sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes
           that things will get better.
           With deep gratitude, your former
           pupil, Martin.
                         
          The MUSIC makes their SILENCE less awkward. Then, after a
          long while, Anne says:
                         
                          ANNE
           Stop the CD.
                         
          He hesitates, looks at her, then stops the music. They remain
          SILENT.
           39.
                         
                         
          SCENE 33- INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          They eat. Suddenly, Anne says:
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Where are the family albums?
                         
                          GEORGES
           The family albums? I don't know,
           there, in the other room. Why?
                         
                          ANNE
           Can you get them for me?
                         
                          GEORGES
           What, now?
                         
          Anne nods.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Why, Anne?
                         
                          ANNE
           I'd like to look at them.
                         
          Georges hesitates, and doesn't understand the suddenness of
          this request.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Please!
                         
          He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room. He comes
          back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away
          the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in
          front of her.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Thanks.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (a bit irritated)
           You're welcome.
                         
          With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the
          photos, turns the pages, looks.
                         
                          ANNE
           That's nice.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (self-consciously, softly)
           What?
           40.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           Life...so long... What a long
           life...
                         
          Georges looks at her. She continues to thumb through the
          pages. After a while she turns toward him.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Stop watching me.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (caught in the act)
           I wasn't watching you.
                         
                          ANNE
           Of course you were. I'm not that
           dumb yet.
                         
          SCENE 24 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are both lying in bed. Georges reads the day's news to
          Anne from the newspaper. When he looks over to her, she has
          fallen asleep. He then puts the newspaper on the night stand
          and turns out the light.
                         
          SCENE 35 - INT. BEDROOM - HALLWAY - BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Bedroom.
                         
          It's morning. Georges is helping Anne to get out of bed into
          her wheelchair. As he does it, he notices that the bed and
          her nightgown are wet.
                         
                          GEORGES
           You're soaked through.
                         
                          ANNE
           What do you mean?
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Hold on.
                         
          He sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I'll be right back.
                         
          During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed,
          and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat
          of the wheelchair.
           41.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           It's no big deal. Come on.
                         
          He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes
          her through the hallway into the bathroom.
                         
          He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and
          takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She
          starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come on, darling. It's nothing
           serious. Things like that happen..
                         
                          ANNE
                          (SOBBING)
           I can't... take it any more.
                         
          He holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling
          helpless.
                         
                          GEORGES
           My love. My darling.
                         
          SCENE 36 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Anne is in bed. She's on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair
          beside the bed.
                         
                          EVA
           ... thinking about whether it
           wouldn't be better to invest the
           money in an apartment block. If
           inflation gets going again,
           property is the only sure thing.
           Right now, savings accounts pay
           1.75% at best. Four years ago,
           Geoff bought some stocks with a
           small sum of money and the whole
           thing collapsed. So now we're
           obviously worried. Unfortunately,
           in the meantime, other people have
           had the same idea, and property
           prices are going through the roof.
           Since we came back from
           Scandinavia, I spend all my spare
           time looking through newspaper ads.
                         
          To put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds:
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           It takes time, that's all. We'll
           find something in the end.
           42.
                         
                         
          Another oppressive PAUSE.
                         
                          ANNE
           (slowly) Yes yes I have... I
           have... the grandmother... woman
           with house... not... the house then
           ... money
                         
                          EVA
           I don't understand you, I'm afraid.
                         
                          ANNE
           ... yes... now... it's all... house
           sel... sel... sel... was... in two
           strokes of... so quickly... god
           it's hard... to say... sell...
           money gone... left... there too...
                         
          PAUSE. Eva has tears in her eyes.
                         
          SCENE 37 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges and Eva's husband, GEOFF, around fifty. He speaks
          with a British accent.
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... three times a week... I'm not
           experienced enough. We'll see if
           that's enough.
                         
                          GEOFF
           How much is she asking?
                         
                          GEORGES
           It's paid by the hour. We'll see.
                         
                          GEOFF
           And her?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Anne?
                         
          Geoff nods. Georges shrugs.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           It's hard to say. Sometimes I get
           the feeling she's totally unaware
           of the state she's in. And then I
           feel the opposite. It's... I don't
           know.
                         
                          GEOFF
           And what about the doctor? What
           does he say?
           43.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           He's...
                         
          Eva comes in through the door. She's in floods of tears.
                         
                          EVA
                          (CRYING)
           She only talks gibberish. I don't
           know what...
                         
          Geoff gets up, hesitantly.
                         
                          GEOFF
           Hey, dear...
                         
          He goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was
          sitting.
                         
                          GEOFF (CONT'D)
           ...come here, sit down, it's OK.
                         
          She shakes him off, irritated, and sits down.
                         
                          EVA
           Nothing is OK.
                         
          At first he's vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to
          sit down on the sofa. Meanwhile, Eva turns to Georges:
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           What's going on, actually? You
           can't just leave her lying on her
           bed like that! She's
           unrecognizable! It's ridiculous!
                         
                          GEORGES
           We can't do anything for the
           moment. Calm down, darling. She's
           getting medical treatment, they
           give her the necessary medication,
           and there are no other options
           right now.
                         
                          EVA
           What does that mean, "no other
           options"? Why isn't she in a
           hospital?
                         
                          GEORGES
           She had a second stroke. Bertier
           examined her and felt we could
           spare her all the hospital
           inpatient procedures.
                          (MORE)
           44.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anyway, they wouldn't keep her,
           they'd send her to a care home.
           What they do in those places, we
           can do here.
                         
          Eva looks at him, amazed.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           And she won't be put in a care
           home. I promised her that.
                         
                          GEOFF
           Don't you think you're taking on
           too much?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Have you got a better idea?
                         
          Geoff doesn't know what to say. Eva has composed herself
          somewhat and blows her nose.
                         
                          EVA
           I can't believe that these days
           there's no way of handling this
           efficiently.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (CURTLY)
           No one's stopping you from finding
           out.
                         
          Eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. Georges follows
          her with his eyes.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                          (PEACEABLY)
           Believe me, I love your mother as
           much as you do. So please, don't
           treat me as if I was a total idiot
           incapable of doing the obvious.
                         
                          EVA
           I didn't say that. I'm simply
           questioning whether what I see
           going on here is the answer to
           everything!
                         
                          GEOFF
                          (TO GEORGES)
           Don't you want to get a second
           opinion?
           45.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Now you two had better stop, OK?
           Another doctor did come. He said
           Bertier was right. From Monday, a
           nurse will come three times a week.
           Now can we talk about something
           else?
                         
                          EVA
           Like what?
                         
          SCENE 38 - INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Georges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff.
          On the radio, the EVENING NEWS.
                         
          SCENE 39 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne
          down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost
          incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an
          object, as tears flow silently down her face.
                         
          SCENE 40 - INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY
                         
          Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We
          watch her and listen to her for a while.
                         
          Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano.
          Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The
          MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated.
                         
          SCENE 41 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water
          and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close
          to Anne to feed her her food.
                         
                          GEORGES
           There, my love, I hope you like it.
                         
                          ANNE
           OK...
                         
          He begins to feed her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I added a little orange juice. I
           find it tastes quite good.
                         
          She can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running
          back out of her mouth. He wipes it with a tea towel,
          continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she
          keeps her mouth shut.
           46.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come on, Anne, you have to eat some
           more. You've only swallowed three
           mouthfuls.
                         
          Anne continues to keep her lips sealed.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Please, darling. A bit more.
                         
          Anne doesn't move. He puts the muesli on the night stand and
          holds the sipping cup to her lips. She drinks slowly, one sip
          after the other. He pulls the cup back between each sip, to
          give her more time. Suddenly she says:
                         
                          ANNE
           ...Mom to the concert...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes?
                         
                          ANNE
           ...Mom to the concert... no
           dress...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Mom has no dress for the concert?
                         
                          ANNE
           ...Mom to concert... no ... uuu...
           no...
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes?
                         
          Long PAUSE. Georges waits.
                         
          SCENE 42 - INT. BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges and the nurse install Anne on a metal armchair in the
          shower.
                         
          As she does so, the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to Anne.
          Finally, she turns on the tap.
                         
                          ANNE
           (in a monotone)
           Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
           Help!...
                         
          Without being phased, the nurse continues to speak
          reassuringly. Georges remains standing there, helpless.
                         
          SCENE 43 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
           47.
                         
                         
          Kitchen.
                         
          Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of
          coffee. In front of the nurse, on the table, is a sum of
          money. As they speak, we hear, coming from the room, Anne's
          CALLS FOR HELP.
                         
                          NURSE
           ... we could take turns. She'd come
           from 8 till 12 and I'd do 2 until
           6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly
           relieve the pressure on you.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'll think about it.
                         
                          NURSE
           She just has to know in time so she
           can arrange it in her schedule.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Yes, of course, I'll let you know
           in the next few days.
                         
                          NURSE
           Very well. I have to go now...
                         
          She takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up.
                         
                          NURSE (CONT'D)
           Thanks for the coffee.
                         
                          GEORGES
           My pleasure. I'll see you out.
                         
          They both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway,
          takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on,
          she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP.
                         
                          NURSE
           You mustn't take it too seriously.
           Usually they always say something.
           She might just as well say "Mom,
           Mom, Mom". It's just mechanical.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (nodding, softly)
           I know.
                         
          They've reached the door.
                         
                          NURSE
           Goodbye, sir.
           48.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Goodbye.
                         
          He closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment,
          then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP,
          unaltered, continue.
                         
          Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand,
          holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP
          become quieter and finally stop altogether.
                         
          After a long PAUSE:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (slowly, softly)
           I'd like to hire a second nurse.
           The two could take turns. That
           would make everything a bit
           simpler. What do you think?
                         
          Long PAUSE. Then:
                         
                          ANNE
           (softly) ...Help...Help...
                         
          SCENE 44 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are both lying in bed. Georges SNORES noisily. Anne's
          eyes are open.
                         
          SCENE 45 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          The front door. We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters
          with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He
          carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open
          for him.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Would you mind putting them in the
           kitchen.
                         
          The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the
          bags. Georges calls toward the bedroom:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I'm ba-aack!
                         
          He then follows the superintendent into the kitchen.
                         
          The superintendent has put the bags on the work surface.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Thanks very much.
           49.
                         
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Can I do anything else for you,
           sir?
                         
                          GEORGES
           No, thanks, Mr. Méry. You've been a
           big help.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Oh, it's nothing, sir.
                         
          Georges has already taken out his wallet and gives some money
          to the superintendent.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)
           Thanks a lot, sir.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I'll let you know if I need you
           again.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           With pleasure, sir.
                         
          He gets ready to leave. He stops again in the doorway and
          turns around.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)
           May I say something, sir?
                         
                          GEORGES
           What is it?
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           My wife and I, we're very impressed
           by the way you're managing
           everything. I take my hat off to
           you.
                         
          As he speaks, Georges' mobile phone has started to ring.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (taking the mobile phone from the
           pocket of his jacket)
           That's very kind of you. Thanks.
           See you soon.
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
           Give my regards to your wife.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I certainly will. Thanks.
           50.
                         
                         
          As the superintendent leaves the apartment, Georges looks at
          the display on his mobile phone and makes a call.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Hello Eva, how are you?... Things
           are fine.
                         
          SCENE 46 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges, standing at the foot of the bed, faces Anne and
          starts singing.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (insistently)...Sur le pont ...
                         
                          ANNE
           ... Ssssur...
                         
                          GEORGES
           ...Sur le pont...
                         
                          ANNE
           po ... pont ... sss
                         
                          GEORGES
           ...Sur le pont ... Sur le pont ...
                         
                          ANNE
           ... Ssssur le pont ...
                         
                          GEORGES
           (smiling to encourage her): ... Sur
           le pont d'Avignon...
                         
                          ANNE
           ... ssur... le ..
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... pont... Sur le pont
           d'Avignon... (he begins to sing):
           Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse,
           on y danse, sur le pont d'Avignon
           tout le monde y danse en rond...
                         
          He encourages her to sing with him. Starts singing again:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse,
           on y danse ...
                         
          Anne tries to sing too, she has a hint of a smile on her
          face, but she produces only isolated SOUNDS.
           51.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (singing to encourage Anne,
           accompanied by the sounds that she
           produces): Sur le pont d'Avignon on
           y danse, on y danse ... Sur le pont
           d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en
           rond ...
                         
          SCENE 47 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          A second nurse is doing Anne's hair roughly. The brush sticks
          in her tangled hair.
                         
                          SECOND NURSE
                          ("CHEERY")
           ... there we are...now we're all
           beautiful again...so everybody will
           admire us...there...you see...
           wait...
                         
          She takes a mirror that she has placed within reach. Holds it
          in front of Anne's face.
                         
           SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)
           Well?... What do we say to that?
           Aren't we a pretty sight?
                         
          Anne, sickened, averts her eyes. Emits a muffled SOUND. The
          nurse ignores it.
                         
           SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)
           You'll see, Monsieur will be
           dazzled by you...
                         
          Furious SOUND from Anne.
                         
          SCENE 48 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The window opening onto the light well is open. A pigeon has
          landed on the window ledge.
                         
          It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside,
          onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings.
                         
          We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet.
          The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its
          wings, it flutters about the room.
                         
          After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back
          toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite
          direction. George follows it.
                         
          He closes the doors of the other rooms. Coming from the
          bedroom, we faintly hear ANNE'S VOICE.
           52.
                         
                         
          Georges fetches a towel from the bathroom. He chases the
          bird. He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes
          back out through the window. Georges, visibly exhausted, has
          to sit down on the chest in the hallway.
                         
          SCENE 49 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges and the second nurse.
                         
                          NURSE
           ... as you wish, sir. I don't know
           what you were expecting. I gave up
           another job to come and work here.
           You should have thought it over
           before deciding whether you wanted
           a second nurse or not.
                         
                          GEORGES
           But I've only just found out how
           incompetent you are.
                         
                          NURSE
                          (FURIOUS)
           What's that supposed to mean?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I don't want to discuss it with
           you. Anyway, you wouldn't
           understand.
                         
                          NURSE
           No one has ever complained.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Good for you. (To get rid of her)
           How much do I owe you?
                         
                          NURSE
           (after a brief calculation)
           Seven hundred and eighty euros.
                         
          Georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the
          armchair and takes out eight one-hundred euro bills. The
          nurse is hopping mad.
                         
                          NURSE (CONT'D)
           I've never had anything like this
           happen to me before. Who do you
           think you are?! I've been doing
           this job for ten years. I don't
           need you to teach me how to do it.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Do you have twenty euros?
           53.
                         
                         
          The nurse takes out her purse angrily, looks inside.
                         
                          NURSE
           No.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Then take the eight hundred euros.
           You can go now.
                         
          The nurse pockets the money.
                         
                          NURSE
           You're a nasty old man. I feel
           sorry for you.
                         
          Georges has put back his wallet, turns to her again and looks
          at her.
                         
                          GEORGES
           I hope from the bottom of my heart
           that one day someone treats you the
           way you treat your patients, and
           that you too will have no way of
           defending yourself. Now get out.
                         
          She looks at him, at first doesn't know what to answer, then:
                         
                          NURSE
           Go fuck yourself, you old fart!
                         
          She leaves, slamming the door behind her. A few seconds
          later, we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut.
          Georges sits down in his armchair, looks straight ahead. Then
          he lights a cigarette, his hands shake, he smokes.
                         
          SCENE 50 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          He tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping
          cup. She won't loosen her lips.
                         
                          GEORGES
           ... Please, open your mouth... go
           on... open it... Anne! Please!...
           come on... stop that!...
                         
          He sits upright.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           If you don't drink, you'll die.
                         
          Indecipherable SOUND from ANNE.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Is that what you want?
           54.
                         
                         
          PAUSE. She looks at him. He bends over her again, presents
          the cup in front of her sealed lips.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come on, Anne, please.
                         
          She doesn't react. He opens her lips with his fingers and
          tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth.
          Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                          (ANGRILY)
           Goddammit!
                         
          He puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid,
          some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop
          it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the
          towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show
          his helplessness and his anger.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Anne! ... You can't force me to let
           you die of thirst. If you persist,
           I'll call Bertier and he'll put you
           in hospital. They can force-feed
           you there. Is that what you want?
                         
          BRIEF PAUSE.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           I promised to spare you that. But
           you must help me. I'm out of my
           depth.
                         
          He takes the cup again and puts it against her lips.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Please, Anne!
                         
          Her lips remain sealed. He presses the cup hard against them.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Drink that, now!
                         
          It hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little
          liquid.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           There!
                         
          She closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup.
           55.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
                         
           Good.
                         
          Then she spits it all out like a fountain. After a moment of
          bewilderment, he slaps her.
                         
          SILENCE. He's frightened by his own gesture. Then he puts
          down the cup and sits on the chair beside the bed. They don't
          look at each other.
                         
          LONG PAUSE.

          SCENE 51 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The various paintings hanging in the apartment. Without their
          frames. Like views on various realities.
                         
          SILENCE. Sometimes, the REMOTE sound of TRAFFIC in the
          distance.
                         
          SCENE 52 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Living room.
                         
          Georges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper. SILENCE.
          Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS.
                         
          Georges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into
          the hallway and goes to the front door.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Who's there?
                         
                          EVA'S VOICE
           It's me.
           56.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           Eva?
                         
                          EVA'S VOICE
           (a bit irritated) Yes.
                         
          Georges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Just a minute.
                         
          He goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in
          his pocket. He goes into the dining room, also closes the
          door leading to the bedroom. He comes back. He is about to go
          toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant,
          opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby,
          flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens
          the front door.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Hello.
                         
          A brief kiss hello.
                         
                          EVA
           Hello. What was going on?
                         
                          GEORGES
           I was in the toilet. Sorry.
                         
          He closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction
          of the living room.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Come in.
                         
          Eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. He shakes
          his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back
          in the direction of the living room, as if to say: "You
          understand, huh?". Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him
          into the living room.
                         
          He closes the door.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Why this unannounced visit? Where
           have you come from?
                         
                          EVA
           What's going on with Mom?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Nothing. What should be going on?
           57.
                         
                         
                          EVA
           Well... (gesture toward the
                          BEDROOM)
                         
                          GEORGES
           Don't you want to sit down first?
                         
          Eva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down.
          Georges does the same.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           So why are you in Paris?
                         
                          EVA
           What's going on with Mom? Why don't
           you answer the phone? After our
           last conversation, I left four
           messages on your answering machine.
           Why don't you call back?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Sorry. I didn't listen to it.
           Forgive me.
                         
                          EVA
           Don't you realize we're worried?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Your worries are no use to me.
                         
          Eva glares at him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           No, don't get me wrong. I'm not
           criticizing you. I just don't have
           the time to deal with your worries,
           that's all.
                         
                          EVA
           Dad...
                         
                          GEORGES
           No. Let's stop this conversation
           right there. I'm taking care of
           your mother. It's a full-time job.
           And I'm not saying that to
           complain, just to explain why I
           didn't answer your phone calls and
           why I don't want to have any
           pointless discussions on the
           subject. Your mother is just as
           could have been expected: bad the
           whole time.
                          (MORE)
           58.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           She is turning more and more into a
           helpless child, and it's sad and
           humiliating, for her and for me.
           And she doesn't want to be seen in
           that state either. Even the last
           time you visited, she didn't want
           you to come. You two have your own
           life. Nothing wrong with that. But
           let us have our life too. Even
           though it's a lousy one. OK?
                         
                          EVA
           Dad, what's the matter?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Nothing's the matter; your visit
           caught me by surprise. And I'm
           annoyed that you show up here to
           check that everything's OK. Who do
           you think you are?
                         
          PAUSE. Eva is speechless.
                         
                          EVA
           I...
                         
          Then she gets up and makes to go to the door.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Stay here, will you!
                         
          She stops short, looks at him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           (softly, but insistently)
           Please!
                         
          She hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room.
                         
          WE HEAR HER PASS IN THE HALLWAY TO GO INTO THE BEDROOM AND
          HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE DOOR.
                         
           EVA (O.S.)
           Mom? ... Mom??
                         
          Georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. She
          seems upset by the situation, as one would expect.
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
           Tell me, what's going on? Have you
           gone crazy?
                         
                          GEORGES
           Please, sit down.
           59.
                         
                         
                          EVA
           I don't want to sit down. What's
           going on here?
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (QUIETLY)
           Nothing's going on. I want to spare
           us all a pointless drama. I presume
           your mother is asleep. She mostly
           sleeps the whole day. And then she
           wakes up at night. If you really
           want to, we'll go and see her in a
           little while. Now, sit down. OK?
                         
          They look at each other.
                         
          Reluctantly, Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down.
          PAUSE. Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice:
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           We do our speech exercises every
           day, or we sing together. Most of
           the time, I wake up around 5. At
           that time, she's still awake. Then
           we change her incontinence pad. I
           rub cream on her to avoid sores.
           Then, around 7, I try to persuade
           her to eat and drink. Sometimes it
           works, sometimes not. Sometimes she
           tells me things from her childhood,
           then for hours she calls for help,
           and then an instant later she's
           giggling away to herself, or
           crying. Nothing of any of that is
           worth showing to anyone.
                         
          SILENCE. Eva looks down. Finally, she says:
                         
                          EVA
                          (SOFTLY)
           You can't stop me from seeing her.
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (ALSO SOFTLY)
           No.
                         
          They remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up. Georges
          follows her into the hallway.
                         
          He unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom.
                         
          The bright light from outside filters through the blinds.
           60.
                         
                         
          Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne. Finally, she
          caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. Anne opens her eyes.
          Looks at her. No movement.
                         
                          EVA
           It's me, Mom.
                         
          Anne emits a FURIOUS SOUND.
                         
                          EVA (CONT'D)
                          (HELPLESS)
           Can I do something for you? Mom...
                         
                          ANNE
           Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom...
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          Georges has remained by the door. After a while, they both
          leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the
          living room.
                         
          Georges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling
          hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down.
                         
          Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and
          looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing.
                         
          After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva,
          vexed, blows her nose.
                         
          Shortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in
          his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.
                         
                          GEORGES
           The tea isn't very hot any more.
                         
          Eva turns toward him.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           But it does make you feel better.
                         
          After a short PAUSE, Eva comes toward the table. Sits down.
          He fills her cup.
                         
                          EVA
           Thanks.
                         
          She takes the cup, drinks. Replaces it. Still can't bring
          herself to look at him.
           61.
                         
                         
                          GEORGES
           It was silly of me to lock the
           door. I'm sorry. You took me by
           surprise, that's all. I'm sorry.
                         
          She nods her head, indicating she understands. Finally she
          looks at him:
                         
                          EVA
           What's going to happen now?
                         
                          GEORGES
           (with a little ironic laugh)
           What's going to happen now? The
           nurse comes twice a week, and every
           two weeks Dr. Bertier and the
           hairdresser come. That's what you
           want to know, right?
           Things will go on as they have done
           up until now. They'll go from bad
           to worse. Things will go on, and
           then one day it will all be over.
                         
          Brief PAUSE.
                         
                          EVA
           You can't go on like this, Dad.
                         
                          GEORGES
           Can't I? What do you suggest?
                         
                          EVA
           Can't we have a serious talk, you
           and me?
                         
                          GEORGES
           What do you call "a serious talk"?
           What do you want to suggest? Do you
           want to have Mom live with you? Do
           you want to pack her off to a care
           home? Do you? What do you want? Go
           on, talk to me "seriously"!
                         
          Eva looks at him.
                         
          SCENE 53 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Georges is seated on the bed beside Anne, who is still
          bedridden.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ANNE
           (in a rush)... short... short
           dress... only I... only I... all
           long... it was... (with a small
           gesture to imitate a bell): ding...
           dong...
                         
                          GEORGES
                          (SMILING)
           Yes, it swung to and fro.
                         
                          ANNE
           (still rushed) ... yes... to ...
           fro ... you... very serious... like
           that... (she imitates a serious
           countenance, continues in a low
           voice): like that... serious...
                         
                          GEORGES
           (unable to keep from laughing a
           little) Yes. I think I was pretty
           uptight.
                         
                          ANNE
           (smiling) yes... up... tight...
                         
          PAUSE. Anne puts her hand on Georges'.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           ... it was n...nice...
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          SCENE 54 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
                         
                         BATHROOM
                         
          Georges is shaving. Suddenly we hear, coming from the
          bedroom,
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE
           (loud) Help... Help... Help...
           Help... Help...
                         
          Georges wipes his face and, to the sound of Anne's cries,
          crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom.
                         
          Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself.
                         
          Georges goes over to her bed.
                         
                          GEORGES
           (trying to calm her like a sick
           child) What is it?..
                          (MORE)
           63.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           Are you in pain?... What's the
           matter?... Is your pad full?
                         
          He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then
          replaces it.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           No... So what's hurting you?
                         
          He sits down beside her on the bed. Takes her hand.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           It's all right... it's all right ...
           I'm here... everything's fine...
           we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a
           story... but you must be quiet, I
           can't talk too loud, it wears me
           out... Here we go: when I was
           little... well, I wasn't as little
           as all that... it was toward the
           end of primary school, so I was
           about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a
           holiday camp. They thought it would
           do me good to spend the summer with
           kids my own age... We were lodged
           in an old castle in the midst of a
           magnificent wooded landscape... I
           think it was in the Auvergne... I
           don't know... in any case it was
           the opposite of what I'd
           expected... We had to get up at 6
           and go for a morning swim. Not far
           from the castle, there was a pond
           fed by an icy mountain stream. We
           entered it running, in a double
           file. You know, I was never very
           sporty. They had a program to keep
           us on the go all day, probably to
           nip any potential pubescent
           impulses in the bud ... But the
           worst thing was the food. The third
           day after our arrival, there was
           rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice
           pudding. We sat at long tables in a
           huge hall. I didn't want to eat the
           stuff and the housemaster said to
           me: You won't get up until you've
           cleared your plate. So after the
           meal everybody left the room, and I
           remained seated, in tears. I had
           made a secret pact with Mom. I was
           to send her a postcard every week.
                          (MORE)
           64.
                         
                          GEORGES (CONT'D)
           If I was pleased with the place I
           was to draw some flowers on it, or
           if not, some stars. She kept the
           card; it was covered all over in
           stars. After three hours, I was
           allowed to leave the table. I went
           up to my room, got into bed and had
           a fever of 42 degrees. It was
           diphtheria. They took me to the
           nearest hospital where I was put in
           an isolation ward, which meant that
           Mom, when she came to visit me,
           could only wave at me through a
           window. At some point I lost that
           postcard. It's a pity.
                         
          Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still
          holds her hand.
                         
          LONG SILENCE.
                         
          Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his
          pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from
          Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to
          move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it
          with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's
          movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without
          removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          SCENE 55 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Hallway.
                         
          The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city
          clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut
          flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it
          in the closet.
                         
          The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them
          in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water.
          He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water.
          We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE
          HAS STOPPED RINGING.
                         
          SCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall
          closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some
          out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its
          hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up
          again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He
          takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again.
           65.
                         
                         
          Looks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is
          about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress.
                         
          He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the
          wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down
          into it.
                         
          SCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of
          the bedroom.
                         
          SCENE 58 - INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
          with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for
          reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible.
          Suddenly, Georges starts.
                         
          At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between
          the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it.
          For a long time.
                         
          Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the
          kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.
                         
          On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the
          wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen,
          carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm.
          Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
          over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway.
                         
          Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times.
          The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up,
          flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-
          well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an
          exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He
          cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans
          against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.
                         
          SCENE 59 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen
          table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing:
                         
          ... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second
          time already, through the light well. This time I caught it.
          In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again.
          I'm going to ...
                         
          SCENE 60 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY
           66.
                         
                         
          Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at
          the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running
          water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES.
                         
          After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen.
                         
          He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the
          dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices
          his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:
                         
                          ANNE
           I'm almost done.
                         
          Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly.
                         
                          ANNE'S VOICE
           You can put your shoes on if you
           want.
                         
          Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her,
          goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet
          and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work.
          She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears
          for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has
          got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is
          tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out
          again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it
          on.
                         
                          ANNE
           Thanks.
                         
          They head for the front door.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Aren't you taking a coat?
                         
          Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from
          the hook and they leave the apartment.
                         
          SCENE 61 - INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM
                         - DAY
                         
          Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is
          shining. It is fairly bright.
                         
          Hallway.
                         
          SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes
          into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.
          Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes
          into the bedroom.
           67.
                         
                         
          Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies
          only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes
          through the partition door into the dining room.
                         
          There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living
          room.
                         
          There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano
          stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she
          heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the
          table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,
          turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear
          STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the
          armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.

EXT. CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT

CREDIT SEQUENCE.

As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime
pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting
like blood through the veins of a body --
impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing
is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the
modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,
putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:


POV - EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

Now the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision
blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We
hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,
but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.
We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside
someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on
the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He
lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
accident only minutes after impact.

His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are
swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and
approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back
toward consciousness, slips again.

The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,
LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,
speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her
face clearly now, close above him.

Sharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see down
into her   to a place of real caring. She stares into our
eyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there
are more   SIRENS converging in b.g.

                          SHARON
            Can you hear me?
                   (shouting, off)
            This one's conscious!

                          VOICE (O.S.)
            Paramedics on the way!

We are slipping away again. Sharon holds us with her
eyes, and she grips our hand.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                          2.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can
             you feel that?

She holds on tight.     We see that our hand, held in her
own, is bloody.

                           SHARON
             That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on
             -- as hard as you can.

We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the
sights and sounds around us grow more clear.

                           SHARON
             It's over, and I've got you, and
             you're safe. You're safe now.
             You got that? Don't let go.
             Don't let me go.

But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of
night sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TO
LIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black night
begins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAY

We PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW.
The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with
some very rough edges.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years
since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner,
ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD
monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows
behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car,
driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the
bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.

                           SHARON
             That car is older than they are.

                           ROBBY
             '67 Chevy Impala.

                           SHARON
             That's what I said.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       3.

CONTINUED:

                           ROBBY
             Needs a servicing.

                             SHARON
             Don't we all.

Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon
has said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking
her head.

                           SHARON
             Get it together, officer.

As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple
who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking
his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair.
Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a
depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her
thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and
startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive
on.

                            ROBBY
             Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my
             coffee again! You didn't like his
             hair, or what?

                        SHARON
          I love Elvis hair. They were
          going two damn miles an hour.

But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.

                        ROBBY
          Let's roll to this -- fight in
          progress.

As Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIREN
and speeds around the car in front of them.


EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

At the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is
carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for
him.

Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH
LAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his
face. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but
there is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed
and stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up
his pace to catch up to the old man.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                     4.

CONTINUED:

People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open
and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,
or -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- a
threatening or taunting look. These he also meets
openly, without a trace of fear. The man has been
through some kind of fire, and it has left him different
from us. Outside the usual boundaries.

Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him.
Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious,
but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.

                           CATCH
             Y'know... since we're both walking
             the same way, I could take one of
             those bags for you. That way, I
             do some upper body work while I'm
             walking along. Helps my back.
             What d'you say?

The Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.

                           CATCH
             Right now your mind's making
             pictures of me robbing your
             groceires, but, y'know, nine times
             out of ten, people do the right
             thing.

The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he
soon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The old
man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.

                           OLD MAN
             It's the dog food that makes it so
             heavy.

Catch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates,
then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.

                           CATCH
             I guess it's worth it... for a
             good dog.

Catch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Man
nods and starts trudging again. As they walk on
together, Catch reaches for that second bag. The man
relents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catch
carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a
bit for his upper body work.

                                                          5.

EXT. VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAY

This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a
chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight
boys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off
another by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and
resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and
professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him
into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the
young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.

                        KID
          Look at this bitch.    Whoo!   Benny,
          look at this!

Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, taking
this Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.
A crowd watches -- mostly teens.

                        KID
                 (to Sharon)
          You come in with me.    Hey, bitch.

Some of his bystanders friends howl at that.

                        KID
          You're going to arrest me, you
          come into the back seat with me.
          Come on!

He resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.

                         KID
          Come on.   We'll have a good time.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)

Sharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the
Kid keeps mouthing off.

                        SHARON
                 (to radio)
          Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to
          the jail with one male prisoner.

                        KID
          Take off your uniform. Take off
          my handcuffs, bitch, and come back
          here. I want one touch.

                        ROBBY
          Give it a rest!

Sharon is stone-faced through this.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           6.

CONTINUED:

                           KID
             If you're going to put me away,
             you gotta give me one sweet touch.


INT. JAIL BOOKING AREA - DAY

As Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking
counter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. The Kid is
looking at Sharon's hand on his arm.

                           KID
             That ain't the touch.   That ain't
             the touch I want.

They get him to the counter.

                           ROBBY
             As I remove your cuffs, I want you
             to put your hands here. Spread
             your legs. More.

As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move
toward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was
not only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the
stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she
moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his
face into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes down
on his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushes
over to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.

                            ROBBY
             That's it.   Back off, John, we got
             it.

Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance.


EXT. POLICE JAIL PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)

as Robby and Sharon walk to their car. They are
interrupted by one of their lieutenants, SANDERMAN,
walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon. She
meets his look.

                           SANDERMAN
             You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?

She is straightforward, not rebellious.

                           SHARON
             I just dealt with the situation.
             The prisoner...

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          7.

CONTINUED:

                            SANDERMAN
             And you don't see a pattern here?
                    (pause)
             I want you to keep yourself way
             inside the line instead of walking
             on it. All right? Are you taking
             notes?

He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their
car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.

                           ROBBY
             You broke his nose.

                              SHARON
             He grabbed me.     End of story.

                           ROBBY
             And you were waiting for him. You
             were hoping. You were making
             long-range plans for his ass while
             he was mouthing off in the car --
             and you're supposed to be above
             that shit.

                           SHARON
             If you think I crossed the line,
             put it in the report.

                           ROBBY
             Pogo, stop the shit. What is it?
             You pissed off at me, too?

They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel.

                        SHARON
          Not you, Rob. You're a rare
          unthreatened male cop with a good
          marriage, and you like to eat
          where I eat -- so everything's
          code four.

She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches
over and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly at
him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep
breath.

                            ROBBY
          Come over    for dinner tonight.
          I'll call    Charlene. She'd like to
          see you.     It's been awhile. We'll
          talk about    it.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          8.

CONTINUED:

She STARTS the CAR again, more calm, starts to drive out
of the lot.

                           SHARON
             Thanks. But  she'll invite
             friends, try and fix me up. She's
             always trying to fix me up so she
             doesn't have to worry about you
             and me.

                           ROBBY
             She doesn't worry about that.

                           SHARON
             They all worry about that.

They both smile wryly, driving on.

                           SHARON
             You don't need to fix me, Robby,
             or fix me up. I don't want some
             guy to heart and soul me and then
             walk away 'cause he can't stand
             the cop thing -- or worse: he
             wants cop stories every night
             'cause it turns him on, and he has
             no idea who I am inside my head.
             Anyway, I'm busy tonight.

                           ROBBY
             Got some action, huh?    Well,
             that's promising.

                            SHARON
             Yeah.   Hot and heavy.

                                              IMMEDIATE CUT TO:


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into
crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN
DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds
filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with
THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and
RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in
the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING
RADIO.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       9.

CONTINUED:

In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored
object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling
rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.
He puts it in his pocket, walks on.

Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-
THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.
There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for
trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,
walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He
stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,
shouting over the music.

                          CATCH
             Hey! You want to turn that volume
             down? What's your point?

The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC
in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare
death at Catch.

                           DRIVER (MAN)
             What did you say?

                           CATCH
             What's the point of blasting your
             music through the whole zip code?
             Don't you realize there are kids
             trying to sleep in these
             apartments -- old people, sick
             people?

They can hardly believe this.

                           DRIVER
             You better watch your mouth,
             asshole.

Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,
haunted eyes.

                            CATCH
             Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill
             me?

Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something
else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One
of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.

                            MAN #2
             Guy's nuts.   Let's go.

The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the
DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring
at Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.

                                                       10.

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

Catch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a
slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the
corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's
door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.

Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little
caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a
little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her
son is TOMMY.

                         CANDACE
          Hi.

                         CATCH
          Hi.   Your keys are in the...

He gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them,
more friendly now.

                        CANDACE
          Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.
          God. I was trying to carry Tommy
          and all these bags. He was so
          tired. Of course, as soon as I
          put him down he had all this
          energy...

While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy,
who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to,
goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs
that layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to
the mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as
he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution
to say...

                        CANDACE
          Y'know, we were just baking
          nectarine bars because the peaches
          weren't ripe. Ever had a
          nectarine bar?

He smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already
retreating. His contact goes only so far -- and no
further.

                         CATCH
          Sorry.   Gotta be going.

And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his
apartment, unlocks it and steps in.

                                                      11.

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,
lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,
never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a
drawer.

In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer.

He walks back into the living room. He sits on the
floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still
soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking
a bit numb -- and lost.


EXT./INT. DRY CLEANERS SHOP - DAY

Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger
in a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where
alterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman
is just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at
Sharon, a real talker.

                         MRS. VANDER
          Sherry!

                        SHARON
          Hi, Mrs. Vander. You're looking
          good.

                        MRS. VANDER
          Oh, you just wait. I splurged.

She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.

                        MRS. VANDER
          It's for the church and the party.
          It's just a little too long.

                         SHARON
          Looks great.

                         MRS. VANDER
          Y'know, I cried over the
          invitation -- just imagine me in
          church.
                  (laughs)
          It'll be so good to spend time
          with you.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                           12.

CONTINUED:

Sharon forces a smile -- but is mystified. Mrs. Vander
is walking to the counter and pausing to say...

                           MRS.   VANDER
             You know Dan and I   renewed our
             vows last year. I    bet that's
             where your mom got   the idea.

                           SHARON
             Their vows?

                           MRS. VANDER
             Your mom and dad -- the
             ceremony...

Mrs. Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on,
sympathetic and embarrassed.

                           MRS. VANDER
             Oh, well... y'know, I just got
             that invitation a few... just now,
             so I'm sure you'll...

                           SHARON
             Oh, yeah. We've had... there's
             been some problems with the mail
             in our building, so... I'll
             probably get it today.

They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's
been left out.

                           SHARON
             So, I guess I'll see you.

                           MRS. VANDER
          Sure, honey.     I'll see you there.

Sharon leaves -- Mrs. Vander staring after her, feeling
bad. As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,
replaced by an old pain and darkness.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Robby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with
a sign marked "POGUE CONSTRUCTION." Sharon exits the car
and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both
carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her
brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with
each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod.
She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly.
We can sense the strain.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          13.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             I didn't see his truck, so...

                              LARRY
             He's not here.

                              SHARON
             How you doing?

She touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly
gesture, a reaching out. He doesn't respond, only
shrugs.

                              LARRY
             I'm okay.

                           SHARON
             Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big
             now.

                              LARRY
             Growin' fast.

                           SHARON
             Is he looking more like you now --
             or did he get lucky?

She has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief,
wry smile.

                            LARRY
             He's got Kathy's looks and brains
             and my strong back. You should
             feel his grip.
                    (pause)
             You just passing by?

She looks about.

                           SHARON
             Place is coming along nice. The
             octagon window. Dad's signature.

But Larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her
mind.

                           SHARON
             Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to
             hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about
             what's happening.

He turns back to his work now as they speak,
uncomfortable.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           14.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             What's happening?

                           SHARON
                    (hurt)
             So you really weren't going to
             tell me? Nobody was going to tell
             me? Mom and Dad renewing their
             vows, the church, the party. Mrs.
             Vander is all excited. She bought
             a new dress. It's blue.

                           LARRY
             We're workin' on Dad. We think
             you should be there. We told him.

                             SHARON
             Mom told him?

                           LARRY
             We mentioned it.

                           SHARON
             He's holding out, hah?

                           LARRY
             You want to come?

                           SHARON
             It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's
             over ten years, and he won't let
             go of it.

                           LARRY
             You two were always head to head.

                        SHARON
          For good reason. Remember?

                        LARRY
          Let's just leave it.

She stares, then...

                        SHARON
          You're still scared of him.

Pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns
to her.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           15.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             I don't think it's a good idea you
             coming around here in uniform.
             People see it, they think we're in
             trouble here.

                           SHARON
             Nice seeing you, too.

She walks away.     He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes
back to work.


ON STREET

As Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van
approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls
out...

                           SHARON
             Two more minutes.

And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking
now.


EXT. VAN - DAY

The van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife.
Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old.
Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's
side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child.
Kathy smiles, too.

                         KATHY
            Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie
            Sharon.

                          SHARON
            Hey, Champ, my God, look how big.

She has a special affection for the boy -- who is
subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She
takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality.

                          LARRY JR.
            Hi.

                         SHARON
            Ow! You hurt my hand with that
            grip. Whew.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         16.

CONTINUED:

She shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon
reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move.
He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately.

                           KATHY
             We're bringing Larry his lunch.
             Hey, it's good to see you. It's
             been awhile. What?

Sharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear.

                           KATHY
             Oh, I went boom into a low shelf
             -- chasing after him of course.
                    (nodding to the child)
             How're you doing?

Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look
-- and connect.

                           SHARON
             I'm semi-okay. I heard about
             the... ceremony and the party.

                             KATHY
                     (embarrassed)
             Oh. I hope you'll be there.
                     (pause)
             Really.

Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.       She pats
Kathy's arm.

                             SHARON
             Take it easy.    You too, Champ.

The boy offers his little hand to shake again.

                            SHARON
             Oh, no. You're not breaking my
             fingers again.

They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car
and Robby.


EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY)

We WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park
and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing
bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis
practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a
lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one
of the boys, he fires it at the wall.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       17.

CONTINUED:

One of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall
toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this
rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too,
playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a
POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a
bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic.
Catch glances up and sees...


CATCH'S POV

Sharon is in the car beside Robby.


ON CATCH

Stunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why.
He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The
POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and
that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like
lightning. It comes as a quick --


FLASHBACK - EXT. FREEWAY - ACCIDENT SITE    - CATCH'S POV

-- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him,
this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him.


BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

The police car is now converging with other squads just
half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the
boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch
him go, wondering.


EXT. CLOSED STORE - DAY

A police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- as
now Robby   and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it.
Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a
shotgun.    This is RAY JULIETTE.

                           RAY
             Break-in alarm. One suspect in --
             nobody out. Take the back.

And they are moving.


EXT. BACK OF CLOSED STORE - DAY

Robby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we
hear more POLICE UNITS CONVERGING in front.

                                                      18.

ANGLE - STREET

As Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby
moving around the building to the back. He is still
amazed at the sight of her. He decides to follow her,
keeping her in sight, driven.


ON SHARON, ROBBY

They are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man
is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs
from them.

                         ROBBY
          Freeze!

The man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close
behind her. Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as
she runs.

                        SHARON
                 (to radio)
          Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect
          fleeing south on Pico Place, young
          man, green jacket. No visible
          weapon...
                 (to Robby)
          Robby!

                        ROBBY
          Right behind you!
                 (to man)
          Stop and lie down with your
          arms... shit.

The man has jumped a fence.   Sharon follows.

                         ROBBY
          Careful!

                         SHARON
          I see him!

She goes over the fence, then Robby.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

The man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind
glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following.

                        ROBBY
          Citizen on your right!   Hey!

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     19.

CONTINUED:

But Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns
suddenly, pointing a handgun!

                              ROBBY
             Gun!

And Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but
not in time. The man is aiming at her and about to fire
when he is tackled by Catch.

Catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of
the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant,
pointing her gun at him...

                             SHARON
             Freeze!    Right there!

Catch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts
his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at
Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off.

                              ROBBY
             Hey!     Wait!

Two other cops (Ray Juliette and SANCHEZ) rush toward the
suspect on the ground.

                              RAY
             You got him?

                              ROBBY
             He was armed.

                              RAY
             Jesus.

                           ROBBY
             Citizen took him down.

                              RAY
             No shit!?

Sharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted.
More cops are converging. Ray Juliette and Sanchez move
toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon
and the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and
Sharon glance at each other, during...


ON CATCH

as the cops reach him.

                           RAY
             What happened here?

                           CATCH
             I... just saw it and... I saw the
             gun, so...


ON SHARON

                           ROBBY
             You all right, Pogo?

She is shaken, speaks softly.

                            SHARON
             I was dead.   Y'know.

She glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him
from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then
their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks
to her sergeant.

                             SHARON
             He had me.    I was dead.


ON CATCH

He is shaken, too.    Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks
his I.D.

                           CATCH
             I was just walking by.      I live
             near here.

Ray nods, handing the I.D. to Sanchez.

                           SANCHEZ
             Sergeant's going to want to talk
             to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a
             statement.

                           RAY
             Don't worry about it. That's just
             procedure. Look -- we appreciate
             what you did. No bullshit. Let
             us buy you a drink tonight, all
             right? You know where the Rib
             House is?

Catch glances at Sharon again, and he nods.

                                                       21.

EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)

Catch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is
carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well-
kept home. He is taking out a key as he walks to the
covered portico.


INT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY

ELANORA CHU, 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and
intelligence in her eyes. She is in a wheelchair, at a
writing table where she carefully translates an English
text into Chinese characters.

She glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads
for the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her
or into the living room at all.

                        CATCH
          I got you nectarines because the
          peaches are hard as rocks.

                        ELANORA
          Your jacket's all dirty.

She rolls away from the table in her motorized chair --
and as they speak across the house, she performs a
ritual...

                        CATCH (O.S.)
          I tackled a guy.

Elanora is moving about the living room, picking up
framed photographs and turning them face down. We don't
see what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning
them all in a routine way, used to this.

                        ELANORA
          Why would you 'tackle' a guy?!

                        CATCH (O.S.)
          Why do you think?


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Catch is at the cupboards, putting away groceries as
Elanora rolls into the kitchen, her CHAIR HUMMING.

                        CATCH
          He had the ball. He was going for
          a touchdown.

                        ELANORA
          Can you be serious?

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        22.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
                    (as he works)
             What day is today?

                            ELANORA
             Wednesday.

                            CATCH
             No.

They are not smiling at their little jokes, but they have
an ease with each other and the deep love of dear
friends. He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see
some nervousness in him as he says...

                           CATCH
             Met somebody today.

Mrs. Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the
bags to help.

                           ELANORA
             Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had
             the broccolini today. Thank you.

                            CATCH
             A woman.

Elanora is more interested and curious now, still helping
with the groceries and being casual.

                           ELANORA
             You didn't tackle her, too, did
             you?

                            CATCH
             No.

                            ELANORA
             Good, Catch.

                           CATCH
             She's a police officer.

                           ELANORA
                    (stops; worried)
             Are you in trouble?

Catch goes on working, a depth in his eyes.

                            CATCH
             No.   No trouble.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          23.

CONTINUED:

Elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly.     We see
her own depth of feeling.

                           ELANORA
             Well... that's a good thing.

He is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts,
his struggle.

                           CATCH
             I saw her once a long time ago.

Elanora stares a moment.      This has meaning for her.

                            ELANORA
             Where?

He doesn't answer.      He's nervous about this.

                           CATCH
             She looks the same.

Now she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and
continues his work in silence.


INT. RIB HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

It's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO
a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including
Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers.
They're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too.
They are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at
it and says...

                            COP
             Beautiful.

... And Sanchez says proudly.

                            SANCHEZ
             Yeah. My wife's got him in
             agility class.

                            RAY
             No shit.

Ray is handed the photo, and we see that they're talking
about Sanchez's dog, the name "REX" printed on the photo.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         24.

CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who
             the first person was to name a dog
             'Fido,' and what the hell does it
             mean?

                           SHARON
             I like how you're always asking
             the big questions, Ray.

There is some laughter.     Ray is a smart-ass and a flirt.

                           RAY
             I got a big question for you, Pogo
             -- but I can only ask it when
             we're alone.

She moves some of the change on the table, sliding it
toward Ray.

                           SHARON
             Here -- use this -- call your wife
             and ask her instead.

                           SANCHEZ
             I happen to know Ray's wife is
             busy tonight.

They laugh and drink and Ray asks her...

                           RAY
             Why doesn't your partner ever come
             out with us?

                           SHARON
             Robby's a family man.

                           RAY
             I'm a family man.

                        SHARON
          Yeah, but his family actually
          likes him.

More laughter. Sharon's eyes do a quick roam of the bar.
Ray catches this.

                        RAY
          That Lambert -- I guess he's not
          showing either.

She shrugs this off like it's not important and starts to
slide out of the booth.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          25.

CONTINUED:

                           RAY
             Where are you going?

                            SHARON
             The head.   Do you mind?

                           SANCHEZ
             She's just gonna freshen up her
             makeup.

                           RAY
             You're wearing makeup?

She leaves the booth with a wry frown.

                           SHARON
             That reminds me, Ray. You still
             have that eye-liner you borrowed
             from me?

She grins, leaving the laughter behind her.


ANGLE - DOOR

Catch has entered the bar. He is watching Sharon leave
the booth and walk to the rest rooms. He looks back at
the raucous booth and hesitates. He sits at a small
table near the door.


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring
into the mirror. No smile now. We see into her mind for
a second.


FLASHBACK - MAN

Pointing the gun at her face today.


BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)

in the mirror and see how shaken she still is.


ON CATCH

A waitress is leaving his table, and he looks back at
Sharon's booth and sees that she still isn't there. He
starts to turn, and then freezes as he hears...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         26.

CONTINUED:

                              SHARON (O.S.)
             There you are.

She has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him.      He
is surprised, face to face now.

                           SHARON
             We thought you wouldn't show.    Why
             you sitting here?

He shrugs.

                           CATCH
             I don't talk to a lot of people.
             Would you...?

He half rises and gestures to the other chair. She
glances back at her booth, then sits. She's nervous,
too.

                           SHARON
             I didn't have a chance to thank
             you. I'm Sharon Pogue.

She puts out her hand. He stares at that hand for just
half a beat before taking it. They shake. The feel of
her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident,
but he covers this.

                           SHARON
             You look familiar.

                           CATCH
             I guess I live on the beat you
             patrol.

Her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough.

                           SHARON
             Why would you do that -- jump a
             man with a gun?

                           CATCH
                    (shrugs)
             He was going to shoot you.

                           SHARON
             He could've shot you. You have a
             death wish? You a bungee jumper?

                          CATCH
             No. I didn't have time to think
             about it.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          27.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             What d'you think about it now?

                           CATCH
             I figure... it was worth the risk.

                           SHARON
             For someone you don't even know?

                           CATCH
             Yeah -- and for what you do. I
             think cops are great. Out there,
             trying to keep it safe. You know?
             Tough job. Firemen are
             everybody's heroes. Kids wave at
             firemen. People should wave at
             cops. Did you ever think about
             how many people are walking around
             this town because you saved them?

                           SHARON
             I never thought about it.

                           CATCH
             ... because you helped them or
             because you arrested somebody who
             would've hurt them or because you
             just... did your job?

                           SHARON
             Now I'm walking around this town
             because of you. Ever think about
             that? Maybe you should be a cop.

                        CATCH
          I don't know... I look pretty dumb
          in a hat...

He has made her smile.

                        CATCH
          ... and I don't drive and, like I
          said, I don't talk to many people.
          Am I talking too much? I am. You
          go ahead.

                         SHARON
          Okay. What d'you do? You
          employed around here? Oh, God.
          Sorry. Every time I try to talk
          to somebody, it comes out like an
          interrogation.

                                                (CONTINUED)

             Where do you want to be ten years
             from now?

                             SHARON
             What?

                           CATCH
             Somebody taught that to me. Kind
             of a shortcut. You ask somebody,
             what are your plans for
             tomorrow -- what're your dreams
             for ten years from now. It's
             supposed to get things started.

                             SHARON
             Does it work?

                           CATCH
             I never tried it.

                             SHARON
             Bullshit.

                           CATCH
             No. Really. I just remembered it
             -- God is my witness.

                             SHARON
             Not in here.    It's mostly cops.

Now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've
seen from Catch. It's open and real and she is charmed
by it.

                           SHARON
             You have a nice smile.

She's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she
says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for
both of them. Sharon looks up, questioning, and the
waitress nods toward the booth. Catch and Sharon see the
cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. There is
a hint of teasing in their grins. And now Sharon is more
self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink
and turning back to Catch.

                           SHARON
             So... what were we talking about?
             Oh, yeah, you were giving me some
             line about starting a
             conversation.

             The shortcut.

                             SHARON
             Okay.    I'll play.

They clink glasses and drink.         Then...

                           SHARON
             Tomorrow I've got a night watch
             shift. If the weather clears, in
             the morning I'll go hiking. If it
             rains, I'll go to the gym -- and
             the laundromat. Ten years from
             now... I want to be living in some
             mountainous place.

                              CATCH
             Tibet?

                           SHARON
             Could be Tibet. Could be
             Colorado. Your turn.

But now Ray Juliette is approaching the table.

                           RAY
             Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to
             yourself. Come on over, Lambert,
             join the group. We'll buy you
             dinner, give you a medal for
             saving Pogo's ass.

Sharon drains her shot and stands.

                           SHARON
             Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray.
             I'm taking off.

                              CATCH
             Oh.     I'll... walk you to your car.

Catch stands and turns to Ray.

                           CATCH
             Thanks for the drink.

                           RAY
             Least we could do. We don't like
             her very much -- but we don't want
             to lose her.

Sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops.        Ray smiles
and shakes hands with Catch as a good-bye.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          30.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Take care.

And Catch and Sharon leave.


EXT. BAR - NIGHT

As Catch and Sharon exit the building, walk toward her
car.

                           SHARON
             It's not a great neighborhood.
             Maybe I should walk you to your
             car.

                           CATCH
             I don't have a car.

They walk on, silent a moment.      This doesn't come easy
for her.

                           SHARON
             Want a ride home?

                           CATCH
             Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk.

                           SHARON
             It's starting to rain.   Don't be a
             hero.

He hesitates, nervous about it, but then...

                          CATCH
             Yeah. If it's no trouble.
             Thanks.

They walk to her car.

                           SHARON
             Okay... ten years from now, what
             d'you want to be doing?

They walk side by side a moment.      He shrugs.   Then -- in
his open way...

                          CATCH
          I don't know.    This is pretty
          good.

She glances at him, taking this in, then fumbles a bit
with her car keys, and he asks -- nervously again...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        31.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Can you drive okay?

She gets a little defensive.

                        SHARON
          I'm not drunk. You think I'm
          drunk? I'm not. You'll know I'm
          drunk when I'm throwing up, and I
          never throw up, so don't worry
          about it.

He nods, looks at her dead-on a moment.

                        CATCH
          The only time I worry is when
          people tell me not to worry.

                        SHARON
          Get in the car, will you?


INT. CAR - NIGHT

As they get in and she STARTS the ENGINE.

                        CATCH
          I'm on Lundy Street, just off
          Pico.

They drive a while. She notices his anxiety.     He grips
the armrest when she speeds up.

                        SHARON
          I'm good at this.

                        CATCH
          Streets are wet.

                        SHARON
          Are you one of those people who
          drive ten miles an hour in the
          rain? I hate that.

                           CATCH
          I never drive.

She glances at him, and he notices her glance.

                        CATCH
          I'll be alright.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           32.

CONTINUED:

He's forcing himself to relax. He takes a deep breath,
sitting back in his seat. He watches her as she drives.
After a moment...

                           CATCH
             Y'know, I can picture you in
             Colorado.

                            SHARON
             Oh yeah?   What am I doing there?

                           CATCH
             Driving around... pissed off.

She smiles in spite of herself, slows down.

                           SHARON
             I'm not pissed off at you.

                           CATCH
             Give me some time.

Now she laughs. She drives, not to his building, but to
her own street. She parks, takes a deep breath. This
sounds a bit hard-bitten because she's using her
toughness to cover.

                            SHARON
             Those guys  in the bar are my
             friends --  sort of. We work
             together,  we tell jokes and we
             bullshit,  but I can't say to
             them...

She halts.

                            CATCH
             What?

She says this clipped and fast and even tougher:

                       SHARON
         Every time I close my eyes, I see
         that goddamn gun pointing at me
         and I don't know why I'm telling
         you unless it's because you were
         there and because I had three
         drinks, but I'm not ready to go
         inside and close my eyes and I
         don't want to go to your place and
         I don't want to keep driving
         around, so what the hell do we do?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          33.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             Whew. I feel like we're boxing,
             and you've got me on the ropes.
                    (pause)
             We'll do whatever you want.

                            SHARON
             What I want  is to know how you
             happened to  be walking by that
             parking lot  at that minute. What
             if you hadn' t been there?

For a moment, she shows her fear.

                           CATCH
             I guess we were supposed to meet.

They stare a while, then she opens her door.

                           SHARON
             If you want -- you can come in for
             a minute.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As they walk in, she moves into the kitchen.

                             SHARON
             Want a drink?

                             CATCH
             No thanks.

She pours one for herself while he looks about. It's a
stiff drink. Now that he's here, her I-don't-want-to-
make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on. She flops on the
sofa, watches him.

                           SHARON
             Sit down or something.

                           CATCH
             I'm circling awhile.

He's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the
intimate details.

                            SHARON
             You're not supposed to look
             around. I didn't have time to
             straighten up.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           34.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             So... it's more real this way.

                           SHARON
             It's rude.

He turns to her.

                           CATCH
             Now that I'm in here, you seem mad
             about it.

                           SHARON
             I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm
             mad. I don't usually let somebody
             in here, but here you are. That's
             all. Let's talk about something
             stupid.

                           CATCH
             You first.

She smiles in spite of herself.

                           SHARON
             Okay -- one thing I don't believe
             is that 'supposed to' business.
             We were 'supposed to' meet. That
             sounds a little fringy to me, like
             something you might hear on public
             access TV. You believe that?

                           CATCH
             Some people say we each give off a
             particular odor -- that can only
             be detected by one other person's
             brain.

                           SHARON
             So, we... smell each other?   Who
             says that?

                           CATCH
             I have no idea.
                    (as they smile)
             I'm more in the destiny school,
             we-met-in-another-life school. Do
             you believe that? Do you think
             when we die -- we come back in
             another form?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          35.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             You mean like   a duck? No. I
             think dead is   dead. I've been
             thinking about   it all day -- and I
             don't want to   think about it
             anymore.

He looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out
of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down.
He puts the glass on the table.

                           SHARON
             Why'd you do that?

                            CATCH
             See?   Now you're thinking about
             me.

She gets a half smile, assessing him. Her look is
direct, and the attraction is there. He feels it, too,
and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of
snowcapped mountains.

                             CATCH
          Let me guess.       Colorado.

                        SHARON
          It's Austria, but I can't picture
          myself in Austria. I'm not good
          with languages, so I couldn't
          qualify for the departments over
          there.

She rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun
off her ankle. She takes the cuffs off her belt, the
mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket,
puts them all in a desk drawer. She takes off her jacket
and throws it over a chair. Disarmed, she turns to him.
Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce
in her struggle. He sees this.

                           SHARON
             Thanks for... coming up here.

                           CATCH
             Does that mean I'm going?

                             SHARON
                      (flustered)
             No.    You don't have to.    I...

                              CATCH
             You okay now?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                     36.

CONTINUED:

Her eyes grow a bit hard, defensive.

                             SHARON
             Oh.    You're here as a medic.

                           CATCH
             Is this the mad part?

She smiles in spite of herself -- again. He has gotten
to her. She wants to fall into this guy, but she's
pumping those brakes. They are standing close together.

                           SHARON
             Maybe going is a good idea.

                           CATCH
             Can I come back some time?

                             SHARON
             Why?

                           CATCH
                    (shrugs)
             Must be the smell.

That makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with
her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the
back of his neck. Her touch is electric to him. She is
going in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare a
moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and
lets loose his own longing. It is a hungry and
passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks
off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. She is
staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken,
getting the words out just above a whisper.

                             CATCH
             I better go.

She doesn't know what to say. The moment hangs. He
leaves. Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her,
and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot. She
lost control. With a stranger.

                             SHARON
             Oh, God.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Catch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions,
staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the
path of a car. The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the
scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps
paralyze Catch, and he sees --

                                                         37.

FLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE

Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving.


BACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)

This sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one
comes.


FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS

coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory,
and all of this is exploded --


BACK TO SCENE    (PRESENT)

by the angry DRIVER shouting at him.


                        DRIVER
          What the hell do you think you're
          doing?!

Catch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle
of the street. The Driver exits his car and comes toward
him, raging.

                        DRIVER
          Are you crazy?!

Catch isn't even aware of him. The man gawks at this --
and now Catch walks off. It is raining. The streets are
wet.


ANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

As Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken --
but when he passes a parked car with the window half
open, rain getting in, he hesitates. He can't just walk
on. He looks about. He tests the lock. He opens the
door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on.

But a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and
calls out...

                           MAN
          Hey!    Hey!   What did you do?

Catch stops and turns in the rain.     The Man hurries
toward him, upset, angry.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                               38.

CONTINUED:

                              MAN
             That's my car!     What the hell were
             you doing?

                             CATCH
             Nothing.    I just...

The Man shoves him.

                             MAN
             I saw you!    What did you take out
             of there?!

                            CATCH
             No, I rolled up the window.       It's
             rain...

The Man gets in his face, shaky...

                           MAN
             You take my phone?!       Hah?!

He shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion
explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's
jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly
slap, slap, slapping him, saying...

                              CATCH
             Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up!

The Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's
eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness.

                              CATCH
             I helped you.
                    (pause)
             I helped you.

Catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away,
hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled.
He gets five steps away and turns. The Man steps back --
but Catch only says...

                              CATCH
             I'm sorry.

And he walks on.        The Man watches him go.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NEXT DAY

Candace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow,
RATTLING ELEVATOR with her son.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                       39.

CONTINUED:

The elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on
a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a
long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving.

                             CATCH
             Oh.   Sorry.

He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
elevator so the woman and little boy can enter.

                             CANDACE
             Shopping day?

He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he
gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step
inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face
"follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy.
We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries
his new possessions to his apartment.


EXT. OLDER HOUSE - LATE DAY

A well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of
nearly 60 is tending the flowers. She hears someone
approaching the gate in the wooden fence. She looks up.
Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break.
The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an
old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness
in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her
daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug
tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the
garden.

                           SHARON
             It's looking great, Mom.

                           MOTHER
                    (pleased)
             Thanks, honey. It's the best year
             ever for the impatiens. The very
             best.

There is a beat of awkward silence.

                             MOTHER
             Let's go in.


INT. POGUE HOME - DAY

As they enter.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          40.

CONTINUED:

It's a bit dark inside, older furniture, lots of keepsake
clutter and photos. Sharon is restless in here -- bad
memories.

                           SHARON
             Looks the same. Still smells like
             cigarettes. I thought he quit.

                           MOTHER
             He's down to six a day.

                           SHARON
             Your hair looks nice.

Her Mother touches her hair, self-consciously. She can't
help glancing at her daughter in all that gear --
bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and
that gun.

                              MOTHER
             Are you well?

Sharon steps close to the mantel. There is a photo of
her there, graduating from the police academy, a
professional, not a family shot. She is surprised.

                           SHARON
             I guess I'm well. Is this always
             here?

                            MOTHER
             Yes.   It's always there.

                           SHARON
             Did Larry tell you I came by where
             he's working? Is that why you
             called me?

                           MOTHER
             I called because we want to invite
             you to our renewal of vows. It's
             three weeks from Saturday.

                              SHARON
             Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to
             invite you.

                              MOTHER
             The family.

Sharon takes that in, still looking about.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          41.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             How come you're renewing your
             vows?

                           MOTHER
             It's sort of... a fresh start.

                            SHARON
             Your idea?

                           MOTHER
             No. Both of us. It's a way of...
             having the marriage blessed.

                           SHARON
             Wasn't it blessed before?

Her Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them.

                           MOTHER
             Sherry... of course it was
             blessed. You just...

                           SHARON
             I just what, Mom?

                           MOTHER
             You just think about the bad, and
             you never remember the good. I
             wish you remembered the good.

Sharon stares deeply at her.

                           SHARON
             Sorry.  I wish I did, too.
                    (then, almost
                     like a child)
             Does he? Remember any good about
             me?

                           MOTHER
             Of course. He doesn't hate you.
             He just... still feels hurt.

                             SHARON
             Hurt?    I hurt him?

                       MOTHER
         Being arrested like that.
         Somebody doesn't forget that.

                      SHARON
         Oh? How come you forgot what he
         did?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        42.

CONTINUED:

                           MOTHER
             It wasn't as bad -- you always
             make it sound worse. And it
             hasn't been that way for years.

                        SHARON
          I'm glad it hasn't been that way.
          That means it worked, Mom. That
          was the point. That's why I did
          it. Christ. Why do I get
          punished for it?

                        MOTHER
          Honey, nobody's punishing you.
          We're inviting you. Will you
          come?

                        SHARON
          Of course I'll come.

                        MOTHER
          We didn't think you'd want to.

                          SHARON
          Why not?

Now her Mother shows a trace of fear.     She says gently...

                        MOTHER
          We don't want any trouble... on
          that day. Please.

                           SHARON
             Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't
             want any trouble -- ever. I'll
             come to the ceremony. I won't
             come to argue, and I won't come in
             uniform.

They each get a small, sad smile.

                           MOTHER
             It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's.

                           SHARON
             I'd like you to send me an
             invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's
             a beautiful invitation.

Her Mother starts to leave the room.

                              MOTHER
             I'll show you.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        43.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Mom. I'd like to get one... in
             the mail... from my family. Okay?

                           MOTHER
             Yes.

Sharon goes to the door, then stops and turns, letting
her guard down all the way to say...

                           SHARON
             Tell Dad... thanks.

And she leaves.


EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Sharon is climbing the   outdoor staircase to her
apartment, tired after   her shift, drained a bit   by her
visit home. When she    reaches her door she sees   that a
long-stemmed rose has   been masking-taped to her   door.
Written on the masking   tape is: "Catch Lambert"    and a
phone number.

She pauses, staring at this, gets a little grin.


INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

Sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the
bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo
albums from her girlhood. In a vase on her bed table is
Catch's rose.

Sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within
the family that has shut her out. She closes the book,
angry at herself for nearly crying. She sits up and
catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and
pulls out the tape with Catch's phone number on it.

She's very conflicted    about this. She puts the tape
down, but it sticks to    her fingers. She tears it off and
tries to throw it onto    the table, but it hangsoff her
thumb. She sighs and     steels herself and dialsthe
number.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT

He has bought a shelf unit that "needs some assembly" and
he's at work with a screwdriver, his new chair and table
nearby, the phone on the floor. PHONE RINGS, and he
picks it up.

                                                          44.

FULL SHOT

As we INTERCUT the call:

                          SHARON
            Do you have a machine?

                           CATCH
            What?

                          SHARON
            Do you have an answering machine?

                           CATCH
            Yes.

                          SHARON
            Will you hang up please, and I'll
            call your machine.

                           CATCH
            Why?

She hangs up. He stares at the phone a moment,
bewildered. He hangs up, and his PHONE RINGS. He lets
it ring. His MACHINE comes on with no recording, only a
BEEP.

                          SHARON
            Hi. Maybe we can... have
            breakfast or something. I get up
            early and run in Ballard Park.
            There's a Denny's across from the
            park. Like eight or so. If
            you're there, you're there.

She hangs up, sighs a heavy one.

                           SHARON
            Oh, God.

And she falls back on her bed.


INT. DENNY'S - MORNING

Catch walks in, glances at the clock. It's 7 A.M. He's
nervous -- and excited. He takes a seat where he can
watch the park, the runners. He waits.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING

She has tossed and turned all night. She is awake,
turning to look at her clock-radio. It is 7:14. She
raises a hand over it.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          45.

CONTINUED:

It changes to   7:15 and the RADIO COMES ON.    She slams her
hand down on   it, cutting it OFF. She lays    back and
heaves a sigh   that becomes a moan, sits up   again and
picks up the   phone, dials the number on the   tape.

                        SHARON
          Hi, don't pick up. Look, I didn't
          sleep much and anyway this is a
          bad idea. I was feeling funky
          last night and I'm all right now
          so let's just leave it where it's
          at. Bye. Oh, thanks for the...
          Bye.

She hangs up and lays back down and pounds her head into
the pillow and covers herself, even her head, with the
sheet.


INT. DENNY'S - MORNING

Catch is waiting, watching out the window.      It's 8:05,
until we...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. DENNY'S - MORNING

... and now it's 8:38, and Catch is still waiting and
watching.


INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - MORNING

She is still in bed, under the sheet. Someone begins
KNOCKING on her door and she sits up, bleary and
frustrated.

                                SHARON
             Damn it!

She stumbles out of the bedroom to her door.

                                SHARON
             What?!     Who?!

                                CATCH (O.S.)
             It's me.

                                SHARON
             Oh, Jesus.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          46.

CONTINUED:

She opens the door.    He wears a stern look.     She is not
apologetic.

                           SHARON
             I was just falling asleep.
             Finally.

                           CATCH
             We made a date.

                           SHARON
             It wasn't a 'date.'

                        CATCH
          Okay, an 'appointment.'     I keep my
          appointments.

She gives an exasperated moan and turns to stagger back
to bed. He closes the door and follows.

                          SHARON
          I called you.    I called you at
          seven.

                        CATCH
          I get up early. I walked there.
          I waited there.

                        SHARON
          Check your messages.

She heads for the bed, passing a     mirror, looking at her
rumpled self and groaning at the     sight.  She climbs into
bed and snuggles there and puts     the sheet over her head.
He is entering the bedroom. He      carries a Denny's take-
out bag.

                           SHARON
                    (under the sheet)
             I need more sleep. Come back in a
             month.

                           CATCH
             Come back? What makes you think
             I'd come back here?

The lump under the sheet says...

                           SHARON
             Then why are you here?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          47.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             I'm here to tell you that when you
             tell someone you're going to be
             somewhere then that someone
             rearranges his life and you should
             be more aware of that and a lot
             more considerate instead of
             just...

She has come out from under the sheet and is watching
him.

                           SHARON
             What's in the bag?

                            CATCH
             What?   None of your business.

                           SHARON
             Did you bring some coffee?

                           CATCH
             You think you deserve coffee?

                           SHARON
             What else did you bring?   Food?

                           CATCH
                    (opening the bag)
             You definitely don't deserve food.
             I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener,
             non-dairy...

                            SHARON
             Just black.   Black. Thanks.

She sits up. He hands her the coffee.         She sips,
relishing the sip, then studies him.

                           SHARON
             So what kind of life did you
             rearrange in order to get to
             Denny's? You never said one word
             about yourself last night. What
             d'you do?

                           CATCH
             What's the difference?

                           SHARON
             What's the difference?! You're
             standing in my bedroom. That's
             the difference. Who are you?

                           CATCH
             Somebody who keeps appointments.

                           SHARON
             You're ducking. Don't duck.
                    (then a thought)
             Oh, shit -- you're married, right?

Convinced -- she picks up one of the throw pillows from
the bed and tosses it at him.

                           CATCH
             I'm not.

                           SHARON
             I don't believe you.

                           CATCH
             You don't believe me?   Give me
             back the coffee.

                           SHARON
             No.

                           CATCH
             Give me the coffee.

She hands him the coffee. He hits her with the pillow
and hands her back the coffee. He has made her smile,
but she continues, half teasing now.

                           SHARON
             Oh, God. Oh, wait -- you're
             involved in some criminal
             activity, aren't you? Great --
             That's all I need.

                           CATCH
             My name is Catch Lambert. I don't
             work. I don't commit any crimes.
             I like being with you. We can
             start from here -- from now.

                          SHARON
             Bullshit. I'm... I let you in
             here. I'm not going to be some
             fool. I need the details.

                           CATCH
             And I need to start from here.

                           SHARON
             That's ridiculous. Why?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        49.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             That's the way it is.

                            SHARON
             Oh.   Your rules.

                            CATCH
             My rules.

                           SHARON
             Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don't
             really want to know you anyway.
             Goodbye.

He is conflicted -- but he won't relent. He walks to the
door. She stares, waiting. But he never turns around.
He walks out. She is mystified, exasperated. She hears
her FRONT DOOR CLOSE. She puts the coffee on her bed
table -- and finds herself staring at that damn rose.
She suddenly gets up and begins to dress hurriedly --
with a plan.


EXT. BOULEVARD - DAY

Sharon is driving, speeding a bit, getting to Catch's
building ahead of him.


EXT. CATCH'S BUILDING - DAY

He approaches his apartment building, unlocks the front
door, walks in the entrance area. Now we see, across the
street, Sharon exit her car and follow him.


EXT. BUILDING - DAY

The front door has locked automatically. Outside there
is a panel of buzzers and apartment numbers. Sharon hits
all the buttons. Somebody BUZZES her in.


INT. LOBBY - DAY

Sharon enters, looks at the elevators. It's not moving.
She goes to the stairs, listens, hears him TRUDGING UP
the stairway. She follows silently.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

As Catch reaches his apartment door, unlocks it, opens it
and walks in.

                                                          50.

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - DAY

Before he can close the DOOR behind him, it BANGS open
wider, startling him -- and Sharon is in the doorway,
staring hard at him.

                         SHARON
                 (sarcastic)
          Can I come in?

She walks in and closes the door and starts looking
around as he says...

                          CATCH
          Yeah.   Sure.   Come in.

Despite his recent "decorating" the apartment is still
nearly empty. No books, magazines, photographs, no
clutter of life. She glances into the equally sterile
kitchen.

                        SHARON
          You live here? Nobody lives here.
          This place is some kind of front,
          a scam, a drop -- or what?

                        CATCH
          This is what you told me about --
          right?

                          SHARON
          What?

                        CATCH
          Your interrogation.      Do I need a
          lawyer?

He has made her look at herself, and take a breath.

                        SHARON
          I just don't want to be jerked
          around.

                          CATCH
          I'm not.

                        SHARON
          Then tell me straight out.      Who
          are you?

He is silent, and she starts to leave.     Moment of truth.

                        CATCH
          What is it you're looking for?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          51.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             Your life.    I don't want any
             surprises.

                          CATCH
             This is it. I sleep here. I walk
             around town. That's all of it.

                           SHARON
             That's all of it?

                           CATCH
             Yeah. Except for you -- the way I
             feel about you.

                             SHARON
             Which is?

                             CATCH
             Surprising.    I thought it was
             impossible.    I thought I was...

                           SHARON
             You thought you were what?       Gay?

                            CATCH
             Dead.   In a way.

                           SHARON
             I'm supposed to understand that?

                           CATCH
             No. Did you ever wonder what
             'scratch' meant, when people say,
             'we'll start from scratch'? This
             is scratch. We can start from
             here.

She looks at him, looks at his empty place, his non-life,
and back at him again.

                             SHARON
             I don't know.    I just don't know.

She breaks off the stare and heads for the door.     He
watches her go.



EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (SAME DAY)

As Catch charges up the stairs to the wide porch of Mrs.
Chu's well-kept home, carrying a grocery bag, head full
of his thoughts.

                                                         52.

INT. MRS. CHU'S HOME - DAY

As Catch enters. She is watching TV. He does glance
into the living room briefly to throw her a quick hello
smile, before moving to the kitchen. She SNAPS OFF the
TV and begins turning the photos face down as she sends
her voice to the kitchen.

                        ELANORA
          I remember that. That was a
          smile.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

He is putting groceries away as she rolls into the room.
He doesn't look at her, tries to be casual, but his
thoughts are bubbling out.

                        CATCH
          You know the cop -- the woman cop?
          She... visited me.

Mrs. Chu registers surprise at this, but keeps it covered
and casual.

                         ELANORA
          Oh?   Where did she sit?

                        CATCH
          I have a chair now.

                        ELANORA
          You're... seeing her?

He darkens a bit as he works.

                        CATCH
          She has a lot of questions.    She
          wants to know everything.

                        ELANORA
          Of course she does. Everybody
          does.

                        CATCH
          We could start from today.    What's
          so wrong with that?

                        ELANORA
          Tell her.

The can in Catch's hand bangs on the cupboard, and he
stops, suddenly uptight.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        53.

CONTINUED:

                              CATCH
             Tell her what?

Mrs. Chu comes closer.

                           ELANORA
             Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody.
             It's been almost two years.

                              CATCH
                       (a warning)
             Nora...

                           ELANORA
             Every time I tell somebody, it
             gets a little bit easier. I'm not
             saying it goes...

His next warning is tough and absolute.

                              CATCH
             Nora!

She is silenced. The moment hangs. She rolls her chair
to him, takes a box of cookies out of his hand, opens the
box and eats one, defusing the moment.

                              ELANORA
             She nice?

He starts to work again.

                              CATCH
             She's tough.

                              ELANORA
             She pretty?

                           CATCH
             That doesn't matter.

                            ELANORA
                    (smiles)
             She is pretty.

                       CATCH
         She's sort of pissed-off at me.

                             ELANORA
         Apologize.

                             CATCH
         For what?

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          54.

CONTINUED:

                           ELANORA
             It doesn't matter. We like it
             when men apologize.

He stares at her a while.

                           CATCH
             I'm sorry I yelled at you.

She smiles and hands him the box.

                              ELANORA
             Have a cookie.     See?


INT. POLICE REPORT ROOM - NIGHT

Sharon is typing at the computer, dark and dogged in her
work.  Lieutenant Sanderman is watching her through the
glass wall of the watch commander's office. He comes out
of the office and moves to where Sharon is typing.

                              SANDERMAN
             Sharon...

                           SHARON
                    (typing)
             Lieutenant...

We can see the   computer screen now. Sharon is searching
for any prior   record of "Catch Lambert" -- arrests,
convictions.    She has several "Carl Lamberts" on the
screen, even a   "Casper," no Catch.

                           SANDERMAN
             Anything bothering you?

                            SHARON
             Why?   What'd I do?

                           SANDERMAN
             Nothing. I'm talking about your
             general attitude lately.

Sharon stops typing.     She can find nothing.    She clears
the screen, sighs.

                           SHARON
             My attitude's fine. End of a long
             day. I'm tired.

                           SANDERMAN
             Family matters getting to you?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       55.

                              SHARON
             Family?!

                           SANDERMAN
             Your brother, Larry...

                           SHARON
             What about Larry?

                           SANDERMAN
             You know Nester -- on the Culver
             City P.D.? He went out on a
             violent domestic dispute
             yesterday. A neighbor called it
             in. It got a little ugly. No
             arrest -- a warning.

This hits her hard.

                              SHARON
             Larry.     Oh Christ.

                           SANDERMAN
             Nester said it's not the first
             time.

Sharon is quiet a while, taking it in, shaken by it.

                           SHARON
             Thanks for telling me.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET (CULVER CITY) - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Sharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house. It
has a small yard with kids' toys strewn about and a tire-
swing. She walks up on the porch and RINGS the DOORBELL.
She hears VOICES inside, LARRY AND KATHY, a quick
murmuring, low-voice argument, can't make out the words.
In a moment, Larry opens the door.

                           LARRY
             Jesus, you're up early.

                           SHARON
             I wanted to catch you before you
             went to work.

                           LARRY
             I thought you were on late shifts.

                           SHARON
             I don't sleep much. Can I come
             in?

                                                        56.

INT. LARRY'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The place is messy.    A TV can be heard -- CARTOONS.

                          LARRY
          What's up?

                          SHARON
          Where's Kath?

                        LARRY
          She's busy with Larry Jr. right
          now.

Sharon nods, but then walks past him.


INT. CHILD'S ROOM - DAY

As Sharon walks into this toy-strewn room. Larry Jr. is
sitting on the floor, watching a small TV. Kathy is not
with him. Sharon kneels beside the boy a moment.

                          SHARON
          Hey, Champ.

But he stays focused on the TV, some darkness, some
unsayable worry in his eyes. She picks up a toy car,
speaks softly.

                        SHARON
          Y'know, they call this one a woody
          'cause it has wood on the sides.

                          LARRY JR.
          I know.

Now he looks at her with sad and bottomless eyes. She is
hurting for him. Larry is now in the doorway. Sharon
kisses the child's head and walks out, passing her
brother.

                        LARRY
          Why'd you come by?

                          SHARON
          To see Kathy.


INT. HALLWAY

As Sharon heads for the master bedroom, Larry takes her
arm.

                        LARRY
          She's not feeling good.

                                             (CONTINUED)

Sharon pulls away from her brother.

                           SHARON
             I'll just say hello.


INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Sharon walks in. Kathy is sitting on the bed, her face
badly bruised. They stare. Kathy speaks quietly, her
eyes filling.

                           KATHY
             Don't make it worse.

                              SHARON
             It gets worse?

                           KATHY
             He's okay now. He's torn up about
             it. Don't make him mad.

Sharon moves closer. She reaches out, touches Kathy with
a comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face
away.

                            SHARON
             When Larry and I were growing up,
             our mother said that all the time.
             'Don't make your father mad.'
                    (pause)
             Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?

                           KATHY
             He never would.

                            SHARON
             Oh.   Just you, huh?

Larry is in the doorway now, angry.

                           LARRY
             What d'you think you're doing in
             my house, Shar? In my home.

She walks out of the room and he follows her.


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

She turns on him.

                            SHARON
             You see a pattern here, bro?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         58.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             I lost my temper. Things got out
             of hand. It won't...

                           SHARON
             People always say that: 'I've got
             a temper.' Like it's an excuse.

                        LARRY
          I don't need a goddamn lecture.

She comes very close to him.

                       SHARON
         You want to hit someone?       Next
         time your 'temper' flares      up, Lar,
         and you just have to hit      somebody,
         you go home and hit your      father.

                       LARRY
         You blame everything on him.

                       SHARON
         I'm blaming you, you fucking
         coward.

He grabs her shirt hard.

                        LARRY
          You don't come in here...

He pushes her into the wall.

                        LARRY
          You don't come in here and call me
          names.

                         SHARON
          What do you call a man who uses
          his wife as a punching bag?
                  (pause)
          Coward.

He swings a slap at her. She blocks it and punches him
hard in the face, and he crashes down on the floor.
Kathy comes running, calling out...

                           KATHY
             Don't hurt her, Lar...!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       59.

CONTINUED:

Kathy sees that it's Larry on his ass. The little boy
comes out of his room. There is a surprised moment.
Then Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his
room. Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding.
Sharon goes close to him, rigid with fury.

                           SHARON
             I know how it feels, 'cause I
             remember. I remember standing
             between you and Dad and taking the
             blows for you -- and for what?!
             You turned out to be just like
             him, you bastard.
                    (pause)
             And so did I.

And she leaves the house and SLAMS the DOOR.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is just returning home after her shift, very tired,
drained. She absently turns ON the TV, the STEREO. She
notices a blinking light on her MESSAGE MACHINE and hits
the button.

                           LARRY (V.O.)
             I bet you feel real proud of
             yourself, Shar, knocking me down
             in front of my family. You know
             what I've got in my hand? I've
             got a Polaroid picture of my
             busted-up face, and I'm thinking
             of sending it to your department,
             to your lieutenant. I'm going to
             turn you in to the police, Shar,
             and see how you like it.

The message ends.     She stands there a moment.

                           SHARON
                    (quietly)
             Oh, God. Oh, shit.

She sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her
thoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her.
In a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a
drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with Catch's number
on it -- but it is all stuck to itself. She hesitates,
then starts to pick it apart when a KNOCK at the door
makes her jump. She wonders, then, somehow, she knows.
She walks to the door.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           60.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             It's you, right?

She unlocks   and opens the door, stares at Catch, very
vulnerable,   on the very edge, her pain and fear over
Larry just   under the surface. Catch holds a box of
cookies as   an offering.

                            SHARON
             Can you just shut up?    Just shut
             up and listen.

                           CATCH
             I didn't say anything.

                           SHARON
             I don't want to talk. I don't
             care if you have to play some game
             and pretend you're a... 'angel of
             mercy' or... whatever. I don't
             care, but I don't want to hear
             about it. All right? I don't
             want to hear anything.

She steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and
turns to him.

                           SHARON
             It's a bad night.

He sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes
through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head
on his chest. He embraces her fully, and the effect on
him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and
longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit.
She sighs. In a moment...

                           SHARON
             This is good... but I'm too tired
             to stand up anymore.

He walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then
slowly, gently, he "disarms" her. He lifts her leg,
takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the
table. He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from
the middle of her back. He reaches into her pants pocket
and removes the Mace. From her shirt pocket he takes her
I.D. shield. He has her lie down on the couch now, their
faces close, eyes locked. They linger...

                           SHARON
             You want to kiss me?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                       61.

CONTINUED:

He looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. He comes
toward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch,
she says, softly...

                           SHARON
             Kiss me someplace I've never been
             kissed.

He's not sure what to do. He begins to look her over --
as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. He starts
slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Her
shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he
starts to move there, but checks her with a look. She
shakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. He
takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft
flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her
eyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, and
then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside
of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her
knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them
to... No. He stops. She looks at him, a deep look, soft
voice.

                           SHARON
             Why do you stop? You always stop.

She has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the
deep pain. He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes
a moment. Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on
his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the
pillow. He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her
eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. Our TRUMPET
MUSIC slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a
while, and then --

                                           SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Just after dawn. Catch has slept on the couch. He is
beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the
windows. The dreamy TRUMPET FADES OUT. Catch's eyes
clear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly
shaken by --


FLASHBACK - CATCH'S POV

-- a sliver of memory. But in this one, he is driving.
We see his hands on the wheel. Then his POV looks to the
side and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside
him, attractive, about his age. Her name is Annie. She
is saying something to him. We don't hear the words.
When the FLASHBACK ENDS --

                                                        62.

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

Catch sits up on the couch, jolted.   He gets another
sudden --


FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS

glaring through his windshield, blinding him. He gasps,
sitting there on the couch, but it's all over. He
stands, rattled, and he moves toward Sharon's bedroom.


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Sharon is peacefully asleep. He stands over her with
troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look.
He bends close to her face. He feels her breath on him.
He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and
very gently brushes her cheek. She stirs. He does it
again. She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. He
smiles at her.

                          CATCH
          New day.


EXT. BOULEVARD - DAY

Sharon is driving Catch home. They are now on a main
boulevard of stores, office buildings. They stop at a
light. Both are surprised by a voice calling out from
the pedestrians crossing the street.

                          PINDELLA (O.S.)
          Catch?

They look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the
middle of the crosswalk to face their car. He is in his
forties, tall, with grey-blond hair. This is RICHARD
PINDELLA. He has a small smile and wave for Catch.
Sharon is curious, looking at Catch. Catch throws the
man a dark look and then turns away, ignoring him,
nervous, intense.

                          PINDELLA
          Catch?

                        CATCH
                 (to Sharon)
          Drive, will you?

Pindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him,
wondering.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                         63.

CONTINUED:

                             CATCH
             Drive!

The light changes. Pindella hurries to the curb as the
cars surge forward. Sharon drives slowly, checking the
mirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the
office building on the corner.

                        CATCH
          Will you get off this street?

She makes a turn, glancing at Catch.

                             SHARON
          What?       You owe him money?

But his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer.
Then...

                        CATCH
          If you take a right and stop -- we
          can walk from here. I'd rather
          walk.

He is nervous, being in the car -- and glad to leave it
when she pulls over. She watches this, wondering.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Sharon exits the car and locks it, staring at Catch.

                        SHARON
          If you're in trouble...

                             CATCH
             I'm not.

                           SHARON
             If you're in trouble with him,
             maybe I can help.

                           CATCH
             Forget about him. Somebody I used
             to know. I don't want to know him
             anymore. That's all. Forget
             about it. Walk with me.

She hesitates,    then falls in   beside him as he walks on.
They walk along    in silence,   the neighborhood growing more
seedy, tougher    as they go.    Catch is relaxing now, trying
to push it all    away. Sharon    looks around her.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           64.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             This is not a great place to walk.

                           CATCH
             I like it here. It's fine.

                            SHARON
             I work here.   It's not fine.

                           CATCH
             What's the problem?

                           SHARON
             Besides the shootings, break-ins,
             rapes, cart thefts? We've got a
             loose dog raiding garbage cans,
             knocking 'em over. Can't catch
             him. Got somebody blowing a
             trumpet between midnight and
             three. Can't find him.

As someone approaches them, Catch makes eye contact and
smiles a small, friendly smile-in-passing. He gets a
brief smile in return. He and Sharon amble on. He does
it again.

                           SHARON
             You know everybody here?

He nods to another YOUNG MAN he's never met...

                           CATCH
             How's it goin'?

                           YOUNG MAN
             Goin' uphill, man.

Catch and Sharon smile.

                           CATCH
                    (to Sharon)
             You try it.

                            SHARON
             Try what?

                          CATCH
             Go ahead. We need this.
             Everybody.

She has misgivings. A young woman is bustling along.
Sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and
a nod -- but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles
on.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             65.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             I feel like a jerk. I feel like a
             smiley face.

Catch smiles, Sharon frowns, but when an OLD MAN passes,
she gives a small smile. The Man lights up.

                              OLD MAN
             Mornin'.

Catch looks at her. She tries to shrug it off, but can't
quite hide her pleasure. Now Catch is pausing as a woman
is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car.

Catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy
wave that makes her smile. Sharon smiles, too. As the
girl's MOTHER is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks
back at Catch for more fun. He does that quick finger
trick -- trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl
giggles But the Mother is impatient.

                              MOM
             Go on.

The girl gets in. The Mother is about to close the door.
She frowns, mean-eyed.

                              MOM
             Move your arm!

The girl slides in further,         and the Mother slams the
door. The girl follows her          mother with hurt eyes as she
walks around to the driver's         side. Catch has paused to
watch this, his eyes gentle         on the girl. The Mother is
about to enter the car when         she sees Catch staring.

                           MOM
             What are you staring at?

                           CATCH
             She feels bad 'cause you yelled at
             her.

                          MOM
             What?! Who the hell do you think
             you are?

Sharon is uncomfortable.       Catch persists, never flinching
at the woman's anger.

                        CATCH
          She just needs you to smile at
          her.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           66.

CONTINUED:

                           MOM
             It's none of your business!

                           CATCH
             Why not smile at her?   What's it
             cost?

                           MOM
             Who the hell are you to talk to
             me?!

Catch's anger is like flint in his eyes.         It surprises
Sharon. She's upset by this.

                           CATCH
             You're so damn impatient.

                           WOMAN
             Get away from me!

                           CATCH
             You're so busy being pissed off,
             and time is going by.

                           WOMAN
             What?!

                           CATCH
             It's not her fault.

The Woman gets into the car and slams the door.

                           WOMAN
             I'm calling the police!

                            CATCH
             No.  I'm calling the police.
                    (turns to Sharon)
             Hey -- police.

The Woman speeds her car away.       Sharon gets in Catch's
face.

                           SHARON
             Jesus Christ, Catch.

                           CATCH
             Maybe she'll think about it now.

                       SHARON
         You had no right to do that. God!
         You think you know everything?!
         Who the hell are you, some expert
         on raising kids?! The
         neighborhood angel?! Jesus!

                       CATCH
         No. No, I just... some people are
         walking around blind...

                       SHARON
         That's not your problem!

                       CATCH
         Don't tell me what my problem is!

                       SHARON
         Okay, fine -- you tell me what it
         is!

                       CATCH
         Maybe it's not my problem. Maybe
         it's your problem. Maybe you're
         going around blind.

                           SHARON
             Blind to what?!

                        CATCH
          Blind to what's going on around
          you. Blind to what people need.
          We're supposed to take care of
          each other. We're supposed to
          keep each other safe. That's the
          way it should be -- if you're not
          going around blind, like that
          woman...

                           SHARON
             Or like me, right? What about
             you? How come you can see?

That stops him, the darkness rising.    He looks about,
trying to contain it.

                        CATCH
          I think I'll... walk the rest of
          the way on my own.

                           SHARON
          Yeah.    Fine.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                         68.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             I'll call you later -- about the
             hiking.

                             SHARON
             I'll be out.

She turns and walks away.      He is still angry, but sorry
to see her go.

                             CATCH
             Shar... wait.    Hey!

But she   keeps walking, and he watches her walk away.
Then he   walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound
through   it, walking quickly. He is passing an alley,
when he   hears a CRASH. He looks in...


EXT. ALLEY - DAY

He sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage
can. He and the dog stare. Catch walks into the alley,
approaches the big dog, squats down to look the animal in
the eye, and begins petting it. The big mutt is now
leaning into the petting, and Catch's eyes go deep -- and
slowly find their way to a sad smile.


EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Sharon and Robby    are patrolling in their unit. Robby is
driving. Sharon     is watching out the window with a deep-
eyed look, a bit    down because of her argument with Catch.
She is staring as    she rolls along.


SHARON'S POV

She is watching the people on the street, NOTICING, for
once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing
without connecting.


ON SHARON

watching.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

We've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like
this, all blinds open.

CONTINUED:

We START in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is
now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. Some brightly-
painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer.

In the living room there are two chairs now, and more
lamps and tables. Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the
alley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch --
whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a
mountain scene. He holds the picture in one place, then
moves it to another, wondering. His fight with Sharon
still colors his mood, but he's working through it.

                           CATCH
             Do we go for... symmetry? Or...
             more off-center. Japanese.

He glances at the dog as he moves the picture.

                           CATCH
             Are you into this? Bob?

The dog watches him.


EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - EVENING

It is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just
off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on
Larry's street and walking to the door. She knocks --
and takes a step back. Larry opens the door, already
angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the
blow.

                           LARRY
             I don't want you around here.

                           SHARON
             Let's go talk in the yard.

They stare. She starts walking back into his darkening
front yard, looking over her shoulder. She walks to a
tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. He goes
back inside, but leaves the door open. In a moment he
reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him.


ON SHARON AND LARRY

As they meet by the tire swing.    His eyes burn her, hate
and pain.

                           SHARON
             You took a swing at me.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          70.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             You asked for it -- calling me a
             coward. You knew I'd swing. You
             think I look bad now? Look at
             this.

He has a Polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of
her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face.

                           LARRY
             Nice, huh? Beautiful. The
             cops'll love this, right?
             Evidence. Don't you guys love
             evidence?

He puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more.

                           LARRY
             You wanted me to swing.

She looks away.     She nods, speaks softly.

                           SHARON
             I'm sorry I hit you so hard.

                           LARRY
             But you're not sorry you hit me.

                           SHARON
             Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's
             face?!

                        LARRY
          That's not your business! Nobody
          called you, right? She didn't ask
          for you to come here. This is my
          family. You don't get it, 'cause
          you've got no family. Nobody. So
          you try to run everybody else's
          life. Jesus Christ -- get your
          own life. That's the goddam
          problem. Get your own goddamn
          life.

Their stare holds, but she is giving way.

                        SHARON
          Okay. I'm sorry I came here.       I'm
          sorry I hit you. Okay?

                           LARRY
          Okay what?

This is very hard for her.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         71.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Don't go to my department, all
             right?

                           LARRY
             Why the hell not?

                           SHARON
             Larry...

                           LARRY
             Why not?!

                           SHARON
             Because the job's all I got.

                        LARRY
          That's what I said, right?    No
          life.

She nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper.

                        SHARON
          That's what you said.

He makes her wait, thinking it over.

                        LARRY
          And you won't come around here.
          You won't call. Ever.

In a moment Sharon nods.

                           LARRY
             And I don't want you to come to
             Mom and Dad's celebration...

Her eyes snap to his, surprised.

                           LARRY
             Not the church. Not the party.
             Stay away. I don't want you
             around. I don't want to see you,
             Shar.

After another moment, she nods again -- and he snatches
the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against
her chest and walks away. The photo falls to the ground.
Larry says without turning...

                              LARRY
             Go get a life.

... and she snaps.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          72.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             I got a life!

The words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's
not crying. Larry stops and turns.

                           SHARON
             How the hell would you know about
             my life?!

                             LARRY
             I know.

                        SHARON
          You know nothing about me, because
          you don't want to know. The
          family doesn't want to know me.
          Well, too bad. Sharon's got a
          life. Sharon's got a boyfriend.
          Sharon's going hiking in the
          morning with her boyfriend. She's
          not sitting alone miserable like
          you want. Too bad!

She reaches down, snatches the Polaroid photo off the
ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as
hard as it is possible to slam it.


EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY

Moving through the panorama are two small figures on a
hiking trail, traveling uphill on a ridge.


ON SHARON, CATCH

Sharon is pounding along, barely out of breath. She
studies the beautiful view, and it helps her. It lifts
her. Catch is falling behind, breathing heavily.

                           CATCH
             Hey. Hey!   Can you wait up a
             minute?!

She waits.     He catches up.

                           SHARON
             I thought you walked all over the
             city.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          73.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
                    (gasping)
             The city is flat. Okay? Can we
             stop here? Can we examine the
             view? Have a Milky Way? I've
             burned every calorie I ever had.

But she walks on.

                           SHARON
             My favorite lunch spot is another
             half mile.

                            CATCH
             Up?!

She smiles and walks on, and he follows, calling out.

                           CATCH
             I'm not one of those competitive
             guys, you know!


EXT. POND - DAY (BIT LATER)

Sharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges
up and collapses near a stream-fed pond. She hands him a
sandwich, but he shakes his head.

                           CATCH
             No thanks. I can't eat and have a
             heart attack at the same time.

She smiles again and takes a bite and stares off, and
soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her, and
Catch notices.

                           CATCH
             As soon as you get happy, you get
             sad.

                            SHARON
             I'm okay.   Everything's code four.

                           CATCH
             Everything's what?

                           SHARON
             Everything's fine.

                           CATCH
             Fine? This isn't fine. I know
             fine. This is something else.
             Something happened yesterday.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

                            SHARON
             Yesterday -- you mean you want to
             hear about it?

                           CATCH
             Sure I do.

                           SHARON
             No kidding. Why? You never talk
             about yesterday.

                           CATCH
             All my days are the same.

He keeps staring, waiting. She is chewing a sandwich,
looking at him. Finally, she begins -- with no emotion.

                           SHARON
             Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we
             rolled on a 415. Juliette and
             Sanchez had these four guys
             against a wall, but they were
             H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It
             got pretty jumpy, but we got them
             in the car with a couple of
             bruises and Robby got a sprained
             wrist, so I did the rest of the
             shift with a rookie who lost it
             over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old
             woman who'd been dead maybe six,
             seven days, and I usually do all
             right but the smell got to me, and
             I can still smell her. Then we
             arrested a prostitute working out
             of her home, and I carried her
             little girl out to the social
             worker, and the kid was holding on
             real tight and making my shoulder
             wet and I wanted to punch her
             rock-head mother, and then shift
             ended and I had a nice visit with
             my brother Larry.

He is staring at her.     He takes her hands, holds them.

                           CATCH
                    (softly)
             I'm sorry. That would make
             anybody sad.

                           SHARON
             Sorry you asked?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          75.

CONTINUED:

                            CATCH
             No.   No, you can always tell me.

She stares a moment, then speaks with an irony he doesn't
pick up on.

                           SHARON
             Well... I feel better now.    You
             feel better?

                            CATCH
             I feel fine.   Great.

He takes off his T-shirt and begins stripping off his
shorts, his underwear!

                           SHARON
             What are you doing?!

She is surprised, smiling, as he plunges into the pond,
her darkness dissipating.

                           SHARON
             Catch! There's no swimming here!
             And you can't be naked in a state
             park!

He dives under and surfaces again.

                           CATCH
             Take the day off, Pogo!

                           SHARON
             What if a park ranger comes?!

He dives and surfaces once more.       We STAY CLOSE ON him.

                           CATCH
             Take your badge off for once.
             Don't be such a damn Marine about
             everything. Just...

He stops because she isn't there. He looks about. Then
suddenly he sees her, poised on a boulder right above
him, in her underwear about to dive! He yelps and gets
out of her way, and she dives off the rock in classic,
near-professional form, a beautiful, sleek dive. She
hits the water just right and surfaces, and they splash
and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed
play.

CONTINUED:

At one point she jumps at him to dunk him, and he catches
her. They are in chest-deep water and their faces are
close. They pause -- then she goes in for a kiss, but he
pulls his head back, avoiding that kiss and says...

                           CATCH
             Someplace I've never been kissed.

She smiles, staring, then slowly reaches her hands to his
face, gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on
the closed lids, but she changes her mind and instead
puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his
face. Then she moves away. He opens his eyes. She
walks to the shore, moves to her clothes and starts
getting dried and dressed, giving him a soft look.

Catch comes to the shore    to dry himself, but as he
dresses, Sharon glances    at his body -- and the scarring
on his chest and arms.     He is troubled about this,
avoiding her eyes. Then     he makes a decision.

                            CATCH
             They tell me I was in an accident.
             Long time ago.

                           SHARON
             Looks like a bad one.

                           CATCH
             I don't remember it.    I...

She waits -- but he says no more. She continues        to
dress, sliding her shorts over her wet underwear       -- but
before she puts her shirt on, she turns her back       to take
off her wet bra. He glances at her. She looks         over and
catches him glancing. They both smile softly,
ironically, as they finish dressing.

                           SHARON
             We should be thinking about lunch.
             We have to pack up.

                           CATCH
             So soon?

                            SHARON
             Some of us have to work.
                    (teasing)
             You ever work?

                          CATCH
         Yeah.     I worked.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            77.

CONTINUED:

                            SHARON
             Oh?   You remember that?   Working?

She smiles and walks off toward the food. He stares
after her, his smile fading into thoughtfulness, memory,
as he dresses.


EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

Catch is standing outside, looking in through the large
window, searching. His eyes settle on a man, and he
stares. The man, about his age, is having coffee and
reading the paper. Catch is staring deeply, mustering
his courage. He walks into the place.


INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

Catch hesitates, then walks over and stands beside this
man until he -- JACK MOLINA -- looks up. Jack beams with
recognition and surprise.

                           JACK
             Catch -- Jesus!

Catch is held back, smiling a bit, but on thin ice here,
dipping into his past.

                          JACK
             How are you? Sit down. Been
             years. You been out of town?

                        CATCH
                 (sitting)
          I've been around.

Jack's smile clouds as memory kicks in.

                        JACK
          Oh, man, I'm really sorry about
          what happened. I never got a
          chance to say...

Catch, with a steady look, says...

                        CATCH
          We don't need to go there.

Jack nods a moment.

                           JACK
             Okay. All right. So... what
             d'you want, a coffee?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         78.

CONTINUED:

                            CATCH
             I want my old job back.
                    (pause)
             What d'you think?

                           JACK
             You been workin'?

                           CATCH
             No, but I'm up to speed.

                           JACK
                    (thinks)
             Well, it's not good with Randal
             anymore.

                           CATCH
             No?

                           JACK
             No, he's out of it, but Danny
             Coley's got something going.
             Wanna go see 'im?

Catch stares, nods.

                           CATCH
             Finish your coffee.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER SAME DAY)

In a seedy parking lot, tough part of town, Robby and
Sharon are arresting two teenage girls. One of them is
leaning on the car as Sharon searches her. Robby stands
back with the other (cuffed) girl. Robby is staring at
Sharon through this moment -- noting the difference in
her, still very professional -- but softer. The girl is
upset, near tears. Sharon is gentle in her search.

                           SHARON
             I have to check these jacket
             pockets. What's your name --
             Allison?

The girl nods, not trusting her voice.

                           SHARON
             I need to unsnap this, Allison.
             I'm checking your waistband. You
             got to Whitney School?

                           ALLISON
             St. Mark's.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        79.

CONTINUED:

Sharon is searching, Robby is noting all this, his eyes
appreciating the difference.

                           SHARON
             Lift your arms higher. Got a good
             basketball team at St. Mark's.
             You play basketball?


EXT. STREET - NIGHT (LATER THAT NIGHT)

Sharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling
down a residential street of apartment buildings. A
parked car is BLASTING MUSIC, and Robby halts beside it.
Sharon starts making dancing moves to the MUSIC, sitting
there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves,
kidding it. Then Robby HITS the HORN to get the driver's
attention in the parked car. Robby makes a gesture to
lower the volume, and the man SNAPS OFF his TAPE. Robby
rolls on, glancing at Sharon. She wears a small smile,
checking their beat.

                        ROBBY
          What's going on, Pogo?    You're not
          happy or anything?

                        SHARON
          Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is
          shit, but I'm dating this great
          dead guy.

She smiles at Robby's look.

                            SHARON
             He says before I came along, he
             thought he was dead. Sounds
             better when he says it --
                     (stops abruptly)
             Listen.

                           ROBBY
             What?

                           SHARON
             Shhh.   Sh!

Robby stops the unit, rolling the windows down.     They
hear the FARAWAY SOUND of...

                           SHARON
             The trumpet player.

Robby pulls over.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        80.

CONTINUED:

                           ROBBY
             This time we got his ass.

They exit the car and stand in the street, looking up,
scanning the dark buildings -- but the sound is hard to
track, a FAINT BALLAD on a skillful HORN.

                             SHARON
             Wow.

                             ROBBY
             Got 'im?

                           SHARON
             Look at that moon.

They stare at the full moon. In a moment, we hear the
sound of ROARING CARS, their TIRES SCREECHING as they
turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off
the other and force it to stop. The two male drivers are
screaming at each other. Robby shakes his head.

                           ROBBY
             Full moon, man. Hey!

They run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to
confront each other. One big guy carries a baseball bat.
Robby heads off one DRIVER while Sharon intercepts the
BAT-MAN.

                           DRIVER
             This guy's crazy!

                           BAT-MAN
             This asshole side-swiped me!

                           SHARON
             Are you McGuire?

                             BAT-MAN
             What?!

                             SHARON
             Mark McGuire?

                             BAT-MAN
             No.

                           SHARON
             Then put that bat away.   Put it in
             your trunk. Now.

The man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                            81.

CONTINUED:

                           DRIVER
             I never touched his car.

                        BAT-MAN
          You lying bastard!

The man charges, bat in hand, and Sharon makes a flying
tackle, bringing him down hard on the street -- and we
immediately...

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

as she lies on the bed, on her stomach, her top off, and
Catch straddles her, massaging her back and shoulder
which are sore from her tackle.

                              SHARON
          Ow.     Ow!

                              CATCH
         Sorry.

                          SHARON
         No.     That's good. Deeper.

                       CATCH
                (as he works)
         How heavy was this guy?

                              SHARON
         Like a truck.

                          CATCH
         God.     Tractor-trailer?

                              SHARON
         Pickup.        Ow.   Ow! That's really
         good.

She begins to moan as he digs out the pain. He is
fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to
keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her
naked back, and she is moaning -- so he stops and takes a
breath.

                           CATCH
             I better... More oil.

He reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands,
noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop, a very
pretty invitation.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             82.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             This is pretty.

                           SHARON
             Don't get oil on it.

                           CATCH
             Renewal of vows -- that's great.
             Is this your parents?

                          SHARON
             Yes. Just put it down.   I'm not
             going.

                           CATCH
             Why not?

She doesn't answer. He puts it down, comes back to the
slow rubbing of her shoulders, her neck. In a moment...

                           SHARON
             If I go, my brother'll hurt    me
             with the department. I got     mad
             and knocked him down. All     they
             need is a complaint. Just     leave
             it alone and keep rubbing.     Okay?

She moans in pleasure as he rubs, trying to push all
other thoughts away.

                           CATCH
             So... he says you can't go?

                           SHARON
             Can't you rub without talking?
                    (then)
             It's been bad with my family a
             long time, so the hell with it
             anyway. If they don't want me
             there, I don't want to be there.
             All right?

                           CATCH
             All right.
                    (then, as he works)
             Bad how?

                           SHARON
             Oh, Jesus!

But we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and,
for once, she shares it.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                          83.

CONTINUED:

                             SHARON
             My father used to knock us around,
             all of us. But I'm the one who
             called the cops -- finally.
                     (pause)
             They say I turned against the
             family.

Catch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking
at Sharon with more tenderness than ever. In a moment...

                           CATCH
             But... they invited you.

                           SHARON
             You don't know anything about it.
             So forget it.

                           CATCH
             Well... I know about family.

                            SHARON
             Oh, yeah?   What about it?

                           CATCH
             It's... a door you don't close.

                           SHARON
             I didn't close the door.

                           CATCH
             You're closing it now. Right?
             Family invites you, you go.
             Family shows up, you welcome them
             in. That's family.

                          SHARON
             Oh, sure. What if they don't
             deserve it?

                           CATCH
             Then you forgive.

                           SHARON
             You have all the answers.

                           CATCH
             No. I just... It seems like a
             chance, doesn't it? A chance to
             make things right. I'd take it.
             Then you tried -- y'know? And
             it's up to them.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       84.

CONTINUED:

Sharon is considering his words, but she's also deep in
her old pain, defensive, challenging.

                           SHARON
             You close with your family?

That hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now,
looking a little lost. He doesn't answer.

                          SHARON
          See?    So why should I listen to
          you?

But as he works her back in silence, we see her facing
her pain and thinking through it.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

Just after dawn. Catch is on the couch, stirring in his
sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what
he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings.
We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes
snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't
stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he
catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down.
In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom.


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

He comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is
asleep. He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark
thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes
going deep. In a moment he begins to raise a hand to
brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he
stops before touching her. Instead, he brings his face
close to her and lightly kisses her.

She stirs. He kisses her again. She opens her eyes.
They stare at each other. She raises a limp hand and
touches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, for
another kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth,
very tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kiss
again, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the
bed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his
elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once,
hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she
is a salvation, and there is a moment when they both
pause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are
doing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and
begin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as
we slowly...

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

                                                        85.

INT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

The night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody
place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a
lot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy
blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small
dance floor. We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE
AT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who
mostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes
meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there.

The music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head
back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a
more up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and
pulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and
follows.

This number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch
Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more   free
out there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and   she
laughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting   wild
and playful, and it's something to see. We LINGER ON    the
joy and abandon. She's earned it. They go a little
crazy, happy crazy, and in a while we...

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


SAME - HOURS LATER

The blues club is emptying out. It's late. The band is
finishing what seems to be its last number, for the last
of thinning crowd -- including a tired, happy Sharon and
Catch who applaud the end of the number. Catch stares at
her.

                        CATCH
          What's your favorite song?

He rises -- as if to go to the band with a request.     She
smiles, spent.

                        SHARON
          Catch, I'm beat. So are they.   I
          think they're finished.

                         CATCH
          One more.   It's a surprise.

She watches as he leaves her, walks to the bandstand.     He
talks to the leader who is the PIANO PLAYER.


SHARON'S POV

From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano,
Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's
tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder.

                                                       86.

ON CATCH

As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but
excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player.

                             CATCH
            Thanks, Danny.

                          DANNY (PIANO PLAYER)
            Gonna be good having you back,
            Catch.

Catch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit
at Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering
the horn. He puts it to his lips.


ON SHARON

Mouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder -
- and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and
rendering a ballad, like the haunting "ANGEL EYES."

Sharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper
look, not only because he is so good, but because he is
showing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more
than he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he
opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the
music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as
Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and
at this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

We keep the sound of CATCH'S TRUMPET going as he and
Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms
around each other. In a moment, he stops. He can't go
another step. He has to kiss her. He holds her face and
comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her
say softly.

                          SHARON
            Where I've never been kissed.

He stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and
walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less
boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses
her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest
moment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and
prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the
revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS
once as they break, staring.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        87.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Oh, God.

We WIDEN to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20
feet away. Ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to
say...

                           RAY
             Are you in danger there?

                           SHARON
             Go away.

                           RAY
             I was talking to him, Pogo.

                        CATCH
          No thanks, Ray. Everything's code
          four. Go away.

Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the
police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment. She
gestures behind them at the jazz club.

                        SHARON
          See that place? He's going to be
          playing there every weekend.

Catch notes the pride with which she says this.

                        RAY
                 (impressed; to Catch)
          Oh, yeah? What d'you play?

                        SHARON
          It's music, Ray. You wouldn't
          like it.

She waves and walks off with Catch, arms around each
other. The cops watch them go.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Sharon is asleep, alone in the tousled bed.


INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Catch is dressed, putting a leash on Bob, glancing into
the bedroom at Sharon.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                     88.

CONTINUED:

There is love in his look, and then a passing question,
too, a residue of fear now that their relationship has
begun in full -- but it all ends up in a soft smile for
her as he walks Bob to the door. He hesitates at the
door -- then walks into the kitchen and slides open that
drawer of toys, stares at them.


INT. BEDROOM - MORNING (MINUTES LATER)

Sharon is waking, sleepy. She rises, finds a robe and
slips it on, calling out softly for Catch.


INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Sharon sees that Catch and Bob are gone. She drifts to
the window, looks at the day, looks down at the street --
and she sees them.


SHARON'S POV

She sees Catch and Bob on their way into the park across
the street from the building.


ON SHARON

She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress.


EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (MINUTES LATER)

Catch is walking Bob in the park, but is also checking
for someone, studying the playground. He begins walking
toward the swings.


ANGLE - SANDBOX

Tommy, Catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a
metal truck. Catch walks up to Tommy, carrying a bulging
plastic bag -- but Tommy's attention is on Bob, and pets
the big, friendly dog.


ANGLE - CANDACE

She sits on a bench nearby, watching this, smiling a bit.

                                                     89.

ON CATCH, TOMMY

Catch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills
out the contents of the bag -- action figures,
superheroes, soldiers. Tommy goes wide-eyed at the
array. Catch is pleased by the boy's reaction. Catch
keeps a layer of emotion covered here.

                         CATCH
           You like these?

                         TOMMY
           Yeah!

                         CATCH
           Well... They're for you. We can
           pretend it's your birthday.

Tommy stares at him, then back at the toys in delight.
Candace is walking toward them, and Catch turns to her.

                         CATCH
           I hope you don't mind.

                         TOMMY
           They're for me, Mom!

Her look of surprise questions him.

                        CATCH
           Yeah. I've... kind of been saving
           them up.

                         CANDACE
           For Tommy?

He nods. She kneels close to her boy, the toys, pleased
but not quite knowing what to say.

                         CANDACE
           Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.

Catch nods, grins at Tommy who is already at play with
the figures.


ANGLE - SHARON

She has entered the park and witnessed this from a
distance. She is angling toward the playground.


ON CATCH

He watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's
almost too much for him. He touches the boy and rises,
smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off.

                                                           90.

ON SHARON

She hurries her steps to intersect with Catch.


ON CANDACE, TOMMY

                          CANDACE
            Wow, Tommy -- Look at them all.
            Did you say thank you?

Now Tommy looks up. Catch is moving away with Bob,
walking home. Tommy stands up, Candace calls out to stop
Catch.

                             CANDACE
            Excuse me!


ON CATCH

But he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping
through, not darkness, some old joy welling up. We see,
in b.g., Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. We
now have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is
moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path
now. A BIKER is coming on. All in one moment Catch
hears the WHIZZ of the BIKE, Tommy calling out "Thank
you," and Candace shouting "Be careful!" And Catch goes
cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike
path, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure
to be safe. Catch and the biker fall hard. Sharon stops
-- holding her breath. Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and
Candace comes running.

Catch is rising, a little sore and soiled.        The biker is
angry.

                          BIKER
            Goddammit -- I saw the kid.
            Jesus. I wasn't even close.

But Catch is walking     away with that frozen, numb look,
all shut down by his     fear and his memory as Bob trots
along beside him and     the Biker comes after him and Tommy
and Candace watch him     go and Sharon hurries her steps to
catch up. The Biker      reaches Catch first.

                             BIKER
            Wait a minute!     Hey!

But Catch won't turn to him, walking on -- and the man
gets in front of him, raging.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          91.

CONTINUED:

                           BIKER
             Why the hell did you cause a
             wreck?! I told you -- I saw the
             kid, you idiot. I was...

Pain and darkness build in Catch's eyes until he says in
a quiet, choked voice, right into the Biker's face...

                           CATCH
             One more word, and your life will
             change forever.

The man stops talking, looking at the dead certainty in
Catch's eyes. He wants to say more, to save face, but
Catch's look holds him like a fist. Sharon has stopped,
frozen, watching. The Biker turns away and walks back to
his downed bike as Catch moves on. Sharon can hardly
believe all of this, following Catch again.


ON CATCH, SHARON

                               SHARON
             Catch!   Catch!

It takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he
quickly turns and sees her approaching.

                           SHARON
             Are you all right? Your elbow's
             bleeding. I...

But he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in.

                               SHARON
             What's wrong?

He walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she
catches up again.

                           SHARON
             Where are you going? Catch --
             you're scaring me. Please...

But he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way,
faces him.

                           SHARON
             Please, Catch, don't... Can't you
             talk to me?!

He turns and walks off, heading for the street.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                               92.

CONTINUED:

                               SHARON
             Please.   Wait.     I... Catch!

He has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of
the cars, but desperate to get away. She watches this,
frozen, as HORNS BLARE. He has to stop in the middle of
the street to wait a moment, and he stands there,
stricken.


ON CATCH

As the traffic moves around him and the dog -- a HORN
BLARES, BRAKES SCREECH, and he thrown into a storm of...


FLASHBACKS

That come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces
of memory outside any order: He is driving, Annie smiles
at him, headlights blind him, Annie screams, the little
boy in Annie's arms grins at him, BRAKES SCREAM, Annie
says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the
headlights blind him again and BRAKES SCREAM again, and:


BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

Catch stands there shaken and shut down.


ON SHARON

Watching him, shocked and frightened for him. She sees
the traffic let up, and Catch crosses and walks toward
home. She watches him go.


EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY (LATER)

As Robby and Sharon's police unit moves along with
traffic. In a moment they pull over and park beside an
office building. It is the same building the man entered
shouting, "Catch!" Sharon watches the building's
entrance. After a while...

                           ROBBY
             Are you going to tell me why we're
             sitting outside this building
             again?

                          SHARON
            Watching for somebody.       Tall guy.
            40s. Grey-blond hair.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           93.

CONTINUED:

                           ROBBY
             What's it about?

                              SHARON
             It's personal.

                           ROBBY
             Fine -- what am I supposed to do?

                           SHARON
          Chill.

She watches the building, studying the people who come
and go.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - DAY

Catch is at home, still shaken by what happened to him in
the park. He reaches for the PHONE, punches in a number.
It RINGS and Elanora Chu picks up. Catch is deep in his
pain.

                           ELANORA (V.O.)
          Hello?

                           CATCH
                    (softly)
          Hi.

                        ELANORA (V.O.)
          Hi! How are you? Have you been
          out in this great afternoon?
          Brenda took me for a walk.

She senses the silence on the other end and quiets a bit.

                        ELANORA (V.O.)
          Anything wrong?

                        CATCH
          I've been... remembering.

She is quiet for a moment.

                        ELANORA (V.O.)
          Catch... This is good.

                           CATCH
          It's awful.

                           ELANORA (V.O.)
          No.     No, there's good to remember.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                         94.

CONTINUED:

He doesn't speak, shakes his head.

                              ELANORA (V.O.)
             Catch?

                              CATCH
             I'll call you.

He hangs up, staring at his thoughts.


EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

Sharon is still staking out the office building. Robby
is fidgeting. She just keeps watching. When Robby
begins to speak, she puts up a hand to stop him, going
very still, staring out the window at the man who Catch
was afraid of, Richard Pindella. The man enters the
building. Sharon gets out of the car, intense...

                           SHARON
             Give me fifteen.

And she hurries after the man.


INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

As Sharon enters, sees the man at the elevators. He gets
into an elevator, and she just misses him. She watches
the elevator indicator. It stops at two. She hurries up
the stairs.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

As Sharon bangs into a hallway through the stairway door.
She looks one way, looks the other way down the long
hall, and sees the man just entering a door. She walks
to that door. It is marked "private." She knocks and
walks in.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

She enters a comfortable office, many shelves, books,
couch and chairs, big desk. She hears the man's voice
from an anteroom. He's coming toward her.

                           PINDELLA (O.S.)
             Excuse me -- that's a private
             entrance...

He sees her now, sees the uniform.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                           95.

CONTINUED:

                           PINDELLA
             Oh... is there a problem?

He's calm, gentle in the eyes. She stares a moment,
trying to keep her emotions undercover.

                             SHARON
             I'm not sure.    Who am I speaking
             to?

                           PINDELLA
             I'm Dr. Pindella.

She takes her time, afraid.

                           SHARON
             What kind of doctor?

                             PINDELLA
             What is this?

                           SHARON
             Do you know a Catch Lambert?

                             PINDELLA
             Oh.   Yes!   Is he in trouble?

                           SHARON
             I... need to talk to you.

He glances at his watch, worried for Catch.

                           PINDELLA
             Well, I have a patient in five
             minutes. But I can...

                             SHARON
             Are you a...?

                           PINDELLA
             I'm a psychiatrist.

                           SHARON
             And Mr. Lambert...

                           PINDELLA
             My relationship with Mr. Lambert
             is confidential.

She's dying inside -- but covering, lying, forcing her
way into this.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                           PINDELLA
             Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert
             but I can't tell you anything that
             isn't public record.

                           SHARON
             In general. In general.   He's
             your patient, and he...

                           PINDELLA
             He's not my patient. He walked
             away from treatment. That was...
             nearly a year ago.

                           SHARON
             Why did he walk away?

                           PINDELLA
             I can't discuss that, but if you
             know how to reach him, I would
             appreciate being able to talk to
             him.

                        SHARON
                 (desperate)
          You can help by just   telling me
          what's in the public   record.
          It'll take me half a   day to do a
          search. Can you tell    me? Just...

She is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions
coming through. Pindella sees this. She sits on the
edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly.

                        SHARON
          Can you please tell me what's in
          the record?

He stares a moment, sympathetic -- and realizing...

                        PINDELLA
          You were with him -- in the car.
          Your uniform threw me. Are you
          his friend?

She looks at him, nods.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               97.

CONTINUED:

                              SHARON
             More.

He takes that in, leans back on the desk.

                           PINDELLA
             I can tell you he was in an
             accident, hospitalized, referred
             to me as an outpatient...

                              SHARON
             What accident?

                           PINDELLA
             A bus... a city bus hit his
             vehicle. That was a couple of
             years ago. It was... an awful
             thing. His family was in the van.
             His wife and child. His wife's
             parents...

                           SHARON
             A bus... and a van. Where?        On...
             the freeway?

Something is pulling at her memory. Her vision turns
inward, and she stops breathing for a moment --
remembering. She was there. And here we get a...


FLASHBACK - CARNAGE

A glimpse of the carnage -- what she saw, first on the
scene -- with Catch lying there. All the while Pindella
is speaking.

                           PINDELLA (V.O.)
             I think so. Yes. Near Santa
             Monica.  On the freeway. He was
             severely injured but... thrown
             clear.  The others were trapped in
             the van.


BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)

still in shock, looks at Pindella again.

                            SHARON
             Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't
             remember.

                              PINDELLA
             Remember?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          98.

CONTINUED:

                            SHARON
                     (quietly)
             Yes.   I was there. I was there.

Pindella stares, then...

                           PINDELLA
             His wife's mother survived, but...
             she was paralyzed.

She takes a moment, absorbing this.

                            PINDELLA
             Elanora Chu.   She's still in town,
             I believe.

                           SHARON
             Does he... still see her?

                            PINDELLA
             He used to. I don't know.
                    (pause)
             I'm glad to see... he has someone
             else who cares about him. I know
             he's running from this. He left
             all his friends, his home, his
             whole life.

                           SHARON
             He says... he doesn't remember the
             accident.

                           PINDELLA
             He lost a lot of memory. I tried
             to help him with that. He
             resisted. Walked away.

She stares.

                           SHARON
             I think he remembers me.

Very subdued now, she asks...

                           SHARON
             How does he live?

                        PINDELLA
          He received a large settlement
          from the city, but he...barely
          touches it. He was a professional
          musician.

She stares at him and nods.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          99.

CONTINUED:

                          SHARON
             Trumpet.

As he says that, we hear our TRUMPET MUSIC begin -- a
fast and furious MUTED TRUMPET, incredible RIFFS, and we
use this to carry us, as we...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Sharon is in the report room, using the computer,
hunting. We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen. She
is searching the police records to find the accident.
The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She
suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then
we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We MOVE THROUGH Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its
stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS.
We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply,
sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is
looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises
and goes to the phone, punches in a number.


INT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard,
sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up --
as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the
incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven
way, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE
breaks through, he stops suddenly. He waits. His
MACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS. We INTERCUT the call as
Sharon's voice comes on, subdued.

                           SHARON
             Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?

But he sits there, waiting, listening.

                           SHARON
             Why don't we... meet tomorrow?
             I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet
             me there? Westwood and Cole.
             About two o'clock. Okay?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           100.

CONTINUED:

He sits there. He slowly puts the horn down. He reaches
for the phone now -- but she hangs up before he picks up
the call.

                                                 CUT TO:


EXT. WESTWOOD STREET - CORNER - NEXT DAY

Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village
not far from Santa Monica. He is waiting, glancing over
the passing crowds for Sharon. He sees her. She is off
duty, out of uniform. He watches her until she spots
him. She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and
sadness in her smile. They walk to each other and stop
and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking
slowly, and he walks beside her. There is a strain
lingering between them.

                           CATCH
             Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday.
             I...

                            SHARON
             That's okay.

                           CATCH
             It's hard to explain, but it's...
             I'm okay now.

                           SHARON
             You don't have to explain.

He glances at her, wondering, walking along.

                           CATCH
             So... why'd we meet here?

                           SHARON
             So you're the trumpet player who
             was waking people up -- on my
             beat.

They walk along in silence a moment.

                           CATCH
             I used to practice late...
             outside. On my roof.

                           SHARON
             On your roof? That's why we
             couldn't find you.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          101.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH
             I didn't know it bothered anybody
             until you mentioned it. You
             arresting me?

They smile nervous smiles. She walks on, leading him
somewhere. He looks about, beginning to show some
agitation, but covering it.

                        CATCH
          You going to tell me where we're
          going?
                 (as she doesn't
                  answer)
          That's okay. I mean... I'll go
          anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of
          death. The mall on a Saturday.
          Just about any...

He slows his steps, looking across the street and down
half a block...


HIS POV

We see an ivy-covered brick building there, with a sign
that is too far away for us to read.


ON CATCH AND SHARON

He looks quickly away from that building.       She sees his
growing agitation.

                        SHARON
          You can trust me, you know.

She takes his hand.

                        SHARON
          I've got you now. I'm holding on
          -- like before.

                        CATCH
          What d'you mean?

                           SHARON
             Like I held you before.   Like I
             did -- at the accident.

He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it
shakes her.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          102.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             What makes it so... unspeakable,
             Catch? What makes it like that?

He begins to shut down, to grow cold and numb and not
hear this.

                           SHARON
             Is it because you were driving?

He turns away, closing his eyes.

                           SHARON
             I read the reports, and it wasn't
             your fault. It wasn't. Is it
             because you survived and they
             didn't?

She puts her hand out for him again.

                           SHARON
             Catch. Please. Hold on, and
             we'll go in there together...

He does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a
few steps toward that building.

                           SHARON
             You can talk to them. You can say
             goodbye or I love you or
             whatever...

He pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of
rage over his pain.

                           CATCH
             This is wrong! It's wrong!   Why
             are you doing this?!

                            SHARON
             To help you.

                           CATCH
             I don't need your help! I don't
             need this. We don't need this --
             we're fine...

                           SHARON
             We're not. We're not fine, Catch.
             Nothing is fine -- no matter how
             much you pretend.

It is as if she's fighting for his life again -- and her
own.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          103.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             You pretend that nothing happened.
             You walk all over the city helping
             people, but you're dying inside.

                           CATCH
             I'm not dying! I'm not
             pretending! I don't remember! I
             don't remember any of it. So
             leave me alone! What good does it
             do? It's gone! And I'm all right
             this way! Why do you have to
             change it? I'm all right.

She points at the building across the street.

                           SHARON
             Then walk in there.

He can't even look at the place.

                           SHARON
             Walk in there, and I'll walk in
             with you. Walk in there and say
             it's real -- what happened is
             real. Your family died.

                           CATCH
             Don't talk about that!    Don't!

                       SHARON
                (breaking down)
         All right -- you talk about it!
         You tell me your family died and I
         say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and
         you say, I loved them... and I
         say, what an awful thing to lose a
         family...

                       CATCH
                (unravelling)
         Damn you, Shar. Damn you -- why
         won't you stop?!

                           SHARON
             So you can have a life!

                       CATCH
         I have a life! We could have a
         life. We could get up and go to
         work and come home to each other
         and never, never talk about
         before. We don't need to do that!
         Why do we need to do that?!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          104.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Because it happened! Because it's
             the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so
             sorry it happened, but...

                           CATCH
             Nothing happened! If we say it,
             then that's the truth, that can be
             the truth. Say it. Nothing
             happened. Say it, Shar.

                           SHARON
             Catch -- take my hand.    Please.

                             CATCH
             Say it!    I'm asking you to say it.

Her tears come, and she shakes her head.

                             SHARON
             I can't.

                             CATCH
             Why not?

                           SHARON
             Because I want it too much. I
             want everything with you. I want
             all of you -- not just the part
             that isn't hiding and running
             away...

                             CATCH
             Why are   you pushing so hard? Why
             does it   have to be your way? Why
             does it   have to be your truth?
             This is   who I am! This is the way
             I am!

                           SHARON
             Not anymore. It doesn't have to
             be this way anymore because you're
             not alone -- because we're the
             family now. We can be the
             family...

                           CATCH
             You like to push people, don't
             you? You just have to push and
             shove and make it right for you --
             for you. You push everybody,
             Shar. You even pushed your family
             away, didn't you?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            105.

He has stung her. The tears are in her throat.         She has
to take a moment, but she pushes through to say
quietly...

                           SHARON
             I just... want to say...

                           CATCH
             You already said it.   You said it
             all.

                           SHARON
             When you're ready, I'll be there
             for you. I just want to say that.

And she turns and walks away. He watches her go, angry,
scared and sorry for what he said. He takes a few steps
after her, wanting to call out and to stop her. We see
him almost call to her. He is coming apart, watching
her, needing her so much, but unable to call out.

He is shaky. He takes a glance at that building, then
away. He stares after Sharon -- but she's out of sight
now. He steels himself, then looks across the street
again at that building.

He is desperately afraid. He stares at the building a
long while. He begins to cross the street. He makes
fists to keep from shaking. He walks to the entrance.


EXT. BUILDING - DAY

This is the "Wellston Memorial Chapel and Mausoleum."
The sign is on one of the brick pillars. The iron gate
is open. He can't walk in there. He just can't. He
walks away quickly, as if escaping.


EXT. POLICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY

The new shift    of cops is heading for its cars -- Sharon
and Robby, Ray    and Sanchez, others. The mood is relaxed,
teasing talk,    but Sharon is way down. She tries to push
her mood away    and tough through it.

                           RAY
             Rib House after shift today?
             4:30?

                           ROBBY
             I think I'll head home.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                        106.

CONTINUED:

                            RAY
             Pogo?   Bring your friend.

                           SHARON
             No, I think I'll turn vegetarian.

                        RAY
          Gotta have that meat to keep your
          strength up.

                        SHARON
          How come it's not working for you?

There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile.
Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all
business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and
takes us into...


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her
crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. The
TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this. She looks
over at the phone.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a
few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing
RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor,
shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking
for something. The PHONE RINGS. He ignores it. He is
opening up each chart of music, shaking it out,
searching.

Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with
sorrow.

                         SHARON (V.O.)
          Catch.  Can you... pick up?
                 (pause)
          Will you call me?

He keeps searching, seeming to not even    listen. The
MACHINE CLICKS OFF. He shakes the next     music chart and
something falls out. He stares at this     piece of paper,
picks it up, slowly turns it over. It     is a picture of
himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in    crayon by a four
or five-year-old. Catch stares at this     with a depth that
goes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.

                                                       107.

EXT. STREET - NEXT DAY

Sharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall
parking lot, exiting their car. No rush. She's still
very downbeat. As they walk from the car, he keeps
glancing at her, concerned for her.

                         ROBBY
          Pogo...?

She puts up a hand to brush all the words away. She
can't talk about it. She pushes through it by doing the
work.

                        SHARON
          Which store is it?

                        ROBBY
          The little market there. They
          came through a back window last
          night. Mostly vandalism...

They walk on, but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk, a
little child, three years old or so, toddles out the door
of a shop. A SKATEBOARDER is rattling along, and Sharon
makes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently...

                         SHARON
          Whoa...

... and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes
by shouting...

                         SKATER
          Sorry!

And now the WORRIED MOTHER is emerging from the shop...

                        WORRIED MOTHER
          Oh, God, thank you. Billy!

She picks up her boy, walks back into the shop. Sharon
stands there -- as it all blooms inside of her, rocks
her, really, this little act, evoking Catch, who he is,
what he said and what he means to her. Robby is a few
steps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet,
looking around her now at the people walking among the
shops and cafes. She picks one. She catches the eyes.
She gives a brief smile. The smile is answered, shyly,
kindly, the person moves on.

                         ROBBY
          Pogo?

She doesn't move for a moment.    Then she turns to Robby.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          108.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             There's something I have to do.    I
             need an address and phone.

                           ROBBY
             What's the name?

                            SHARON
             Elanora Chu.

Robby looks at her, then nods, giving her this.

                            ROBBY
             Let's do it.

They walk back to the car.


EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

We see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the
front of Mrs. Chu's home. Robby waits in the unit.


EXT. CHU HOME - DAY

Sharon walks under that covered portico to the front
door, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her
a bit.

                            ELANORA (O.S.)
             Pogo?

Mrs. Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling
her wheelchair toward Sharon. She has a smile for her --
but with some reserve.

                           SHARON
             I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all
             about the...

                            ELANORA
             Elanora.

Sharon nods, very held back.        She gestures toward the
wheelchair self-consciously.

                           SHARON
             I'm sorry for... what happened.     I
             know about the accident.

                           ELANORA
                    (hopeful)
             He told you?!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           109.

CONTINUED:

                          SHARON
             No. I found out, and... I
             remembered. I was there.

                              ELANORA
             Oh.   Yes.

Sharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough
cover in place, over her emotions.

                           SHARON
             I guess he comes here a lot -- to
             talk to you.

                           ELANORA
             He shops for me. Twice a week.

                           SHARON
             Oh. And when he comes here -- he
             never mentions the past, never
             talks about the accident?

                              ELANORA
             No.

                           SHARON
             And you... let him do that?    All
             this time? Why?

                           ELANORA
             It's what he needs.

                           SHARON
             Walking all over the city like...

                              ELANORA
             Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man.

                           SHARON
             But... you let him get so lost.

Elanora is a bit defensive now.

                           ELANORA
             I let him find his own way through
             it. Why did you come here,
             Sharon?

                           SHARON
             Because... I want to know how to
             help him.

                           ELANORA
             You are helping him.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         110.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             I don't think so.

                              ELANORA
             Why not?

                           SHARON
             He... he was paying me back, I
             guess, for the accident, for
             helping him. That's why he
             felt... so close to me. But...

                           ELANORA
             Is that what you think?

                           SHARON
             But now he probably hates me.
             I...

                              ELANORA
             What happened?

                           SHARON
             I took him to the cemetery, and...

                              ELANORA
             The cemetery!

Elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head
in worry.

                           SHARON
             I thought it might help him...
             come back, you know? But he
             wouldn't even go in. He screamed
             at me.

                            ELANORA
                    (upset)
             What made you take him there?

                           SHARON
             For the truth...

                           ELANORA
             He knows the truth.

                           SHARON
             But he won't even say it, or...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          111.

CONTINUED:

                           ELANORA
             That's his way. That's his way
             through all this. He made a wall
             -- around that whole day, that
             night -- other things, too. He
             keeps them behind the wall -- his
             little boy, my daughter. He can't
             help it. The cemetery?! Do you
             know how hard it is for me to go
             to the cemetery? Can you imagine?

Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as
Mrs. Chu goes on.

                           ELANORA
             That's where it stares you in the
             face -- the loss. And it's too
             much sometimes.

Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.

                           ELANORA
             See? I'm still finding my way
             through it. And Catch -- it
             almost kills him to think about it
             or say it or drive a car or see
             the place where it happened or...
             go by the cemetery.

                           SHARON
             I was trying to help him... come
             back to some kind of life. I...

                           ELANORA
             But he was coming back. Do you
             realize how much he changed in the
             past weeks? His apartment, his
             life, his music is coming back.
             He fell in love! He even got a
             job, Sharon -- for you. For the
             two of you. Isn't that coming
             back? Why do you have to rush?
             Everybody has to rush these days.

Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed
now, realizing, admitting.

                           SHARON
             I was scared. I push so hard...
             when I'm scared.

                           ELANORA
             Scared of what?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           112.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Losing him. So I did. I lost
             him. He won't talk to me. I... I
             didn't know what I was doing.

Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away,
studying Sharon's misery.

                           ELANORA
             You were finding your way.    What
             else can we do? You think    I'm
             always sure what to say to   him,
             what not to say? I do what    I
             think is right and hope he   sees
             the love in it.

She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing
now, liking this girl.

                           ELANORA
             Look at you -- so worried now, so
             miserable. That's the love in it.

                           SHARON
             Did I... make it worse for him?

                           ELANORA
             I don't know. I really don't.
             But I think he'll see the love in
             what you did.

Sharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand
to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her
hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with
strength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad.
Elanora watches her go.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her
parents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with
Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to
go through with this.

We START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next
to that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about,
see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In
the b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.

                           SHARON
             I just came by to... wish you
             well. To... congratulate you and
             wish you well. Shit.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                        113.

CONTINUED:

She checks the mirror again, doesn't like the look,
starts undressing, comes back to the table with the gift
on it, wonders if she should add more decoration to the
box. She does, and as the trumpet plays on we --

                                           CUT TO:


SHARON

dressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then --

dressed differently, rewrapping it again and then --

SHARON

sitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap,
looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad.


EXT. STREET - DAY (SAME DAY)

Catch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the-
dog, no strolling gait. He is focused, deep-eyed, on a
mission of some kind. Our MUSIC CONTINUES over this and
on into...


EXT. STREET - DAY

The MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church,
parking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. There is
no one else outside the church. The ceremony has already
begun. She's planned it that way. She enters the church
as the MUSIC FADES OUT.


INT. CHURCH - DAY

As Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, but
perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the
ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue,
altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a
few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of
people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to
glance over.

                                                          114.

CONTINUED:

One of them is Kathy. They trade a brief, nervous nod.
Then Kathy whispers to her husband...

                           KATHY
             She came.

We see Larry grow tense and angry.

                           KATHY
             Don't say anything.   Think of your
             parents.

Larry doesn't look at Sharon. The little boy, looking
fine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to
look at his aunt.

Sharon and Larry, Jr. trade a look.     She winks, then
settles back in her pew, watches.


ON ALTAR

We get our first   look at Sharon's FATHER, Carl Pogue, 62.
Standing beside   his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken
with the moment,   both he and his wife emotional over
this. He wears    a hearing aid. The priest is speaking.


ON SHARON

watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and
the vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals.


EXT. STREET - DAY

The PRIEST'S VOICE from the church plays over this scene,
invoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass as
we watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his steps
now and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial
Chapel. He hesitates. We see the price he's paying and
the determination. He walks through the gate.


EXT. CHAPEL GROUNDS - DAY

He walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a
garden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains and
flowers. He is fighting his way through this, moving
closer to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone on
the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall
of this building, he is alone.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       115.

CONTINUED:

This is a wall   of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on
each vault is   a plaque -- a name. His breath shivers in
his body as he   struggles to lift his eyes. Slowly, his
gaze comes to   rest on a name: "LAMBERT."

As he stares, the PRIEST'S VOICE from Sharon's church
FADES OUT, and we are left with silence. Catch is
shaky,. He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name,
to them -- and he tries to speak, but can't. He tries
again -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper at
first.

                            CATCH
             Annie. Chet. I don't... want you
             to think I forgot about you. It's
             just that I... I couldn't find
             you.
                    (pause)
             I woke up, and you were gone.
             Everything was gone. It all
             just... disappeared. In one
             minute. I couldn't remember that
             minute. I lost it. It took me so
             long to find it. I think I found
             it all now. I used a calculator.
             I did. I figured it out. You
             know... we get about 1400 minutes
             a day and so I figured it out. I
             was 33 years old and three months
             and eight days, so it was... I've
             got it here...

He fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. His hand
is shaking as he reads a number off the paper.

                           CATCH
             It was minute number 17 million
             eight hundred ten thousand, two
             hundred... or so.

He puts the paper away.

                           CATCH
             That's the one I lost. And...
             when I lost that minute, I guess I
             tried to lose it all, all the
             memories -- because they hurt. I
             tried, but... I couldn't do it.

We --

                                                         116.

FLASHBACK - INT. VAN

to that minute and, for once, we go in order and     play out
each piece of it. We see Catch driving the van,      his wife
ANNIE beside him. His son Chet is in back with      his
grandparents, Elanora and her husband. The boy      is a bit
whiny, pouty.

We INTERCUT the flashback WITH --


CATCH

at the grave, struggling through this.

                          CATCH
            Chet... you weren't feeling so
            good, remember? It was your
            birthday, and you ate too much.

We see   Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, and
we get   present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch and
Annie   both say, "What's the matter? Hm? Aww." And then
Annie   looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we
CUT TO   Catch at the grave, his eyes filling.

                          CATCH
            And, Annie, you said... you
            said...

In the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again, and this
time we hear her say, softly...

                          ANNIE
            Slow down in the rain, all right?

We GO TO Catch at the grave, fighting tears.

                          CATCH
            And I don't know if I slowed down.
            I don't know. I hope I did,
            but... I didn't always listen. I'm
            sorry. I'm really sorry.

Back in the FLASHBACK, we see Annie reach around as
Elanora hands Chet to her. Then we're BACK at the grave
and INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking through
his tears and we also see this tender moment played out
in the van.

                          CATCH
            ... You put him on your lap, and
            he looked at me, and I made a
            face. Remember? I made you
            smile, Chet.

                                                           117.

CONTINUED:

                           CATCH (CONT'D)
             And then we all smiled, and it was
             a great minute. It was. I'm
             really glad... I found that
             minute. No matter what.

Catch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of that
minute now plays out, punishing him. It lasts only about
three seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenly
glaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel,
BRAKES SCREAMING, PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then it's over.
And Catch has been battered by the memory, and is
weeping, but has not looked away. He is still staring at
the name of his family, and he is able to say, in a
broken voice...

                           CATCH
             I won't forget... anymore.     I love
             you.

He steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, rests
it there. We STAY ON this, then in a moment, we...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CHURCH - DAY

The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in
the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are
up and milling about, many leaving the church. "See you
at the house." "See you at the party." Etc. A
PHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the
church. Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the
little boy...

                          PHOTOGRAPHER
             All right. The whole family in
             this one. Just...

Out of the milling crowd comes Sharon, taking a breath
and braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly.

                           SHARON
             Where do you want me?

The Photographer turns to her, wondering.

                           SHARON
             I'm the daughter.

                            PHOTOGRAPHER
             Oh!   Oh, well, how about...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            118.

CONTINUED:

We see the family shift so that Larry and his family are
on one side of the parents. Sharon follows the
Photographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside
her Mother. Her Father has not looked at her. The photo
is taken. Sharon now turns to her mom and dad. This is
difficult, the strain is thick in the air.

                           SHARON
             You both look so great.

                           MOTHER
                    (nervous)
             You, too.

                           SHARON
             I just wanted to...

The Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat,
not warm either. No smile.

                           FATHER
             You coming to the party?

                             SHARON
             Sure.

He nods, then turns to greet well-wishers. Sharon is
left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one
old couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs. Vander)
wearing her new blue dress, her HUSBAND beaming beside
her.

                             MRS. VANDER
             Sherry!    Look how nice you look.

                           HUSBAND
             Big police officer now.

                           SHARON
             Not so big.
                    (to Mrs. Vander)
             Nice dress.

Sharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up
with Larry and his family.


EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - DAY

As Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of
the church, calling ahead.

                             SHARON
             Larry...

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          119.

CONTINUED:

He starts to just walk on, ignoring her, but Kathy takes
the little boy and walks ahead, with a look at Larry, at
Sharon.


ON SHARON AND LARRY

They nod to a few passing guests. Then they're alone.
His nose is still bandaged, but less so, anger and
betrayal in his eyes.

                           LARRY
             How did you have the guts to walk
             into a church after breaking your
             word?

                           SHARON
             I have to be here. It's a chance
             to make things right, and I'm
             taking it.

                           LARRY
             Why even talk go me? You got what
             you wanted. You laugh about it?
             You tell your cop friends how
             you...

                        SHARON
          You think I talk about it?!    You
          think...

She stops herself, catching her rush toward the old
anger. She goes calmer, deeper, even sad.

                          SHARON
          Here, Lar.

She hands him something. It is the Polaroid photo. He
looks at it, surprised. They lock eyes. She speaks
softly.

                        SHARON
          I was invited. I'm here. I'm
          going to the party. You do what
          you want.

And she walks off toward the parking lot.


INT. POGUE HOME - DAY

We're in the midst of the party. We see Sharon drifting
a bit, a hello here and there. She feels out of place.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         120.

CONTINUED:

Though the home and yard are thick with people, there is
some tension, especially in the core group -- all who
know about the estrangement of Sharon. Now and then a
nervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, or
a hostile glance from Larry.

Sharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light,
camera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them put
their good wishes on tape. She smiles, then looks over
and sees her Father across the room. He is alone. She
steels herself and heads his way. He makes eye contact,
then averts his look. She is approaching him, about to
speak, when he walks up to some friends and starts joking
with them, leaving Sharon hurt, humiliated.

Her mother has seen this and comes to her, speaking
quietly, nervously.

                           MOTHER
             Don't make him talk about...
             anything today.

                           SHARON
             Mom, I was going to fix his tie.
             His tie is crooked.

She sighs, pushing through her hurt to say...

                           SHARON
             It was a nice ceremony.

                           MOTHER
                    (worried)
             Yes. We're running out of
             chicken, though. Nobody's eating
             the ham.

                           SHARON
             It's a great party, Mom.   You look
             happy.

Some joy is allowed to surface in her Mother's face.

                           SHARON
             Thirty-five years and still in
             love, huh?

Her Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.

                           MOTHER
             You think that's wrong, don't you?

                           SHARON
             Of course not...

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         121.

CONTINUED:

                           MOTHER
             I always... I feel like
             apologizing to you. But I love
             him.

                          SHARON
             I know.

                           MOTHER
             And then I feel like apologizing
             to him for loving you. I'm the
             one in the middle. I'm the only
             one in this family who knows how
             to forgive anybody.

And she walks away. Sharon's eyes follow her, surprised
and thoughtful. She watches her Mother approach her
Father and straighten his crooked tie. Then Kathy is
moving toward Sharon. Sharon turns to her and they both
speak quietly -- at the same time.

                           BOTH
             You look great.

Then they smile sad smiles.       Kathy gestures to her face,
the faded bruise.

                           KATHY
             Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.

They smile wryly again.

                           SHARON
             Sorry about that, but... I
             couldn't stand him doing that to
             you. I took it on...

                           KATHY
             Don't worry. I'm not your mother.
             If he tries it again, I'm gone.
             I'm out of there, me and Larry
             Junior. He knows that.

They stare, and Sharon gives her a hug, Kathy returns it.


ON LARRY

We see Larry, across the room, notice this hug. He keeps
his expression intact for the group he's in, but we see a
flare of anger in his eyes.

                                                          122.

ON SHARON

moving across the living room.

She sees Larry Jr. sitting alone and goes to him, sits
beside the child -- who looks sad.

                          SHARON
            What's up with you?

                          LARRY JR.
            They won't let me watch T.V.

                         SHARON
            Oh. Well... let's pretend this is
            T.V. It's a show about a party.

They look about the room.

                          SHARON
                   (as if it's a secret)
            That man... is really a super
            hero.

                            LARRY JR.
            Is not.

                          SHARON
            Is too. And so is she. Look.
            See? Red tights under her
            dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her
            a drink with something in it.

                            LARRY JR.
            With what?

                          SHARON
            With stuff to make her sleep.
            He's a bad guy.

The woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting
into it.

                            LARRY
            She drank it.

                         SHARON
            Watch. She'll fall down any
            minute.

The boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his
father. Larry puts the boy down near the door.

                          LARRY
            Hey, sport, you should go play
            outside.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       123.

CONTINUED:

He turns to Sharon.

                           LARRY
             Stay away from my family.

Then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without
humor, speaking loudly.

                           LARRY
             Hey, everybody, keep it down.
             Somebody might call the police.

There is some nervous laughter, people watching them now.
Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low.

                           SHARON
             What're you doing?

                           LARRY
                    (to crowd)
             Once the cops leave, we can really
             party.

The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns
back to Sharon.

                           LARRY
             Why don't you give everybody a
             break -- and go home?

In the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and
SHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon
looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother
nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support
there. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door.

She walks to the door, opens    it, starts to leave, starts
to close the door behind her,    and she stops, take takes a
breath, battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt
and anger. She looks at that     nearly-closed door. She
pushes it open and walks back    in.

We see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried
look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the
crowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads
toward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen,
avoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his
Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward
the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Sharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen,
leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow
them.

                                                          124.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Don't walk away. Okay?

He acts as if he just noticed her.

                              FATHER
             What?

She gestures toward his hearing aid.

                              SHARON
             Is it working?     Do you need to
             check it?

He absently touches the device.

                              FATHER
             It's fine.

                              SHARON
             Dad...

But the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on
out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother
looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very
frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper.

                           LARRY
             What the hell are you doing?!

                           MOTHER
             Sharon, please.

                           SHARON
             Please? Please what?! Will you
             stop protecting him? You were
             always protecting him! Don't talk
             to your father. Don't bother your
             father!

She turns to her dad.

                           SHARON
             I'm going to bother you for one
             minute, Dad. Okay? Can you
             handle that?

Larry advances on her.

                           LARRY
             Just get the hell out...

And she turns on him in a fury that halts him.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          125.

CONTINUED:

                        SHARON
          This isn't about you, Larry -- or
          you, either, Mom. This is between
          me and my father, so leave us
          alone for one goddam minute!

She turns back to her father.

                        SHARON
          How about you, Dad. Do you want
          me to leave?

                           FATHER
             Up to you.

                           SHARON
             Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome
             here?

                           FATHER
             Jesus -- you're here, aren't you?
             What d'you want?

                           SHARON
             I want to know!
                    (then, quieting)
             Do you want me here? Do you love
             me, Dad? I want to know.

The question's out, and she's totally exposed now -- and
the silence that follows breaks her heart. She nods
toward his hearing aid. Her voice is close to a whisper,
thick with tears.

                           SHARON
             Do you... need to... check that
             again?

                              FATHER
             I feel like...

He can't finish it.

                            SHARON
             What, Dad?   You feel like what?

                           FATHER
             I feel like I don't have a
             daughter anymore.

She takes the blow and doesn't crumble, only her eyes
show the depth of the pain. She speaks quietly, softly.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           126.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON
             Well... you do. It's a shame
             you're going to miss knowing her.
             You're going to miss all that.

And she leaves, brushing past Larry and her Mother.


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking   back tears.
The party goes on around her, oblivious.    She stops on
her way to the door because she sees the   video crew
moving, hunting the next guest -- and she   makes a
decision and walks toward them, stops in   the light, faces
the camera.

                           SHARON
             I'm next.

As they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch.       Sharon
speaks over a torrent of emotions.

                           SHARON
                    (to camera)
             Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations.

We see her family coming out of the kitchen and walking
into this, surprised, stopping still.

                           SHARON
             Y'know... being in this house
             reminds me of something.  I was
             about ten, I guess, and Larry and
             I were playing aliens -- remember,
             Lar? We're making a lot  of noise,
             and Dad comes home from work tired
             and pissed off...
                                                 CUT TO:

HER FATHER

watching this. Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring
hard, Kathy wondering. INTERCUT their reactions
during...


SHARON

                           SHARON
             We're yelling like mad, and Dad
             bursts into the room and says,
             what the hell are you doing? And
             I'm scared. I'm really scared.
                           (MORE)
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       127.

CONTINUED:

                           SHARON (CONT'D)
             And I say, we're playing alien
             invasion, Dad, and he says, oh,
             yeah, I'll show you a damn
             invasion, and he picks me up,
             picks me up off the floor and
             throws me on the couch. I hit
             that couch and bounce off, and he
             grabs Larry and throws him on the
             couch, and then... then he starts
             making these monster sounds, and
             he says, we came to earth to kick
             ass, and I run at him and jump on
             him and he tosses me on the couch
             and then Larry, and we're laughing
             so hard I almost wet myself, and
             he keeps tossing us and growling
             and beeping, and it was... it was
             great. It was great, and I'm
             never going to forget that.
             Never. And I miss that. I miss
             it. So I just... I wanted to tell
             you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks.
             That's all.
                    (pause)
             Bye.

She hands the microphone back and walks away as the
surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother,
Larry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door
and leaves.


EXT. POGUE HOUSE - DAY

Sharon exits    and starts to walk away. She sees Larry Jr.
look up from    his play. He smiles at her. She returns
the smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on. As
she reaches    the gate, she notices something across the
street that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and so
pleased.


HER POV

Catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now.


BACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT

as Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him
-- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her,
until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he
opens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on
tight, eyes closed.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                         128.

CONTINUED:

They break the embrace, still holding on, searching each
other's eyes.

                            CATCH
             Sorry, Shar.   For what I said.

                              SHARON
             Me, too.

In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house.

                              CATCH
             Was it bad?

                           SHARON
             They don't like me in there.

                           CATCH
             Then they don't deserve you in
             there.

She stares a moment more, still together.

                           SHARON
             That's a nice thing to say.

                           CATCH
             It's not a thing to say.   It's the
             truth.

She can only look away, not wanting to cry.

                           CATCH
             Why do you try so hard not to cry?

She stares at him again. Her throat fills with tears,
mouth is trembling a bit. She starts quietly, finally,
with nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much
as mourning.

                              SHARON
             It's not fair.

The tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the
old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. The
first time we've seen her cry.

                           SHARON
             It's not fair. Things got better
             for them because of what I did.
             Things got better, and I'd still
             do it. I'd do it all over again.
             And it's not fair they shut me
             out. It's not.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               129.

CONTINUED:

                            CATCH
             No.
                           SHARON
             It's not fair. I was     19, and I
             didn't know what else    to do. I
             didn't know how else    to stop it.
             It's not fair I don't    have a
             family anymore.

                            CATCH
             No.   It's not, Shar.    It's not.

He raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on
each cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and
closes her eyes. They remain that way awhile. In a
moment he lightly kisses her forehead. There is a depth
to his words...
                        CATCH
          We're the family, Pogo.

She opens her eyes, staring deep into       his. He has said
it all -- as it is and as it will be.        She smiles a bit
through her tears and nods. He puts        an arm around her
shoulder and holds her tight against       him as they walk to
her car. She puts an arm around his        waist.

They reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind
the wheel as Catch gets into the passenger seat.


INT. CAR - DAY

Sharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from
crying. She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't
move -- no longer sad, but drained now. He watches her.
In a moment, he gets out of the car.


EXT. CAR - FULL SHOT

Catch comes around to Sharon's window. She rolls the
window down, concerned, wondering what he's doing. Is he
leaving? But he reaches for her door and opens it and
says without a fuss...

                           CATCH
          I'll drive.

She stares a long moment,    realizing,    but also making no
fuss about it as she gets    out of the    car, walks around
and enters the passenger    side. They     close the car doors.
Catch STARTS the CAR and    drives them    away. Drives them
home.
                                                   FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

Abrupt medium close-up of Alvy Singer doing a comedy monologue.  He
wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark.

				ALVY         
		There's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly 
		women are at a Catskills mountain 
		resort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the 
		food at this place is really terrible." 
		The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and 
		such ... small portions." Well, that's 
		essentially how I feel about life.  Full 
		of loneliness and misery and suffering 
		and unhappiness, and it's all over much 
		too quickly.  The-the other important 
		joke for me is one that's, uh, usually 
		attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think 
		it appears originally in Freud's wit and 
		its relation to the unconscious.  And it 
		goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... 
		"I would never wanna belong to any club 
		that would have someone like me for a 
		member." That's the key joke of my adult 
		life in terms of my relationships with 
		women.  Tsch, you know, lately the 
		strangest things have been going 
		through my mind, 'cause I turned forty, 
		tsch, and I guess I'm going through a 
		life crisis or something, I don't know. 
		I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.  
		I'm not one o' those characters, you know. 
		Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's 
		about the worst you can say about me.  I, 
		uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get 
		older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the-
		the balding virile type, you know, as 
		opposed to say the, uh, distinguished 
		gray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm 
		neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' 
		those guys with saliva dribbling out of 
		his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria 
		with a shopping bag screaming about 
		socialism. 
			(Sighing) 
		Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't 
		get my mind around that.  You know, I-I 
		keep sifting the pieces of the relationship 
		through my mind and-and examining my life 
		and tryin' to figure out where did the 
		screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we 
		were... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and 
		... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a 
		morose type.  I'm not a depressive character.  
		I-I-I, uh, 
			(Laughing) 
		you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, 
		I guess.  I was brought up in Brooklyn 
		during World War II.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE-DAY

Alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his  mother in an old-fashioned, 
cluttered doctor's office.  The doctor stands near the sofa, holding a 
cigarette and listening.

				MOTHER 
			(To the doctor) 
		He's been depressed.  All off a sudden, 
		he can't do anything.

				DOCTOR 
			(Nodding) 
		Why are you depressed, Alvy?
 
				MOTHER 
			(Nudging Alvy) 
		Tell Dr. Flicker. 
			(Young Alvy sits, his head down.  His 
			mother answers for him) 
		It's something he read.

				DOCTOR 
			(Puffing on his cigarette and 
			nodding) 
		Something he read, huh?  

				ALVY 
			(His head still down) 
		The universe is expanding.

				DOCTOR 
		The universe is expanding?

				ALVY 
			(Looking up at the doctor) 
		Well, the universe is everything, and if 
		it's expanding, someday it will break apart 
		and that would be the end of everything!

Disgusted, his mother looks at him.

				MOTHER 
			(shouting) 
		What is that your business? 
			(she turns back to the doctor) 
		He stopped doing his homework.

				ALVY 
		What's the point?

				MOTHER 
			(Excited, gesturing with her hands) 
		What has the universe got to do with it?  
		You're here in Brooklyn!  Brooklyn is not 
		expanding!

				DOCTOR 
			(Heartily, looking down at Alvy) 
		It won't be expanding for billions of years 
		yet, Alvy.  And we've gotta try to enjoy 
		ourselves while we're here.  Uh?

He laughs.

Fall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it. 
A line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window 
of the house a band shakes a dust mop.

		My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood 
		memories, but I swear I was brought up 
		underneath the roller-

INT. HOUSE

Alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while 
his father sits on the sofa reading the paper.  The house shakes with every 
move of the roller coaster.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		-coaster in the Coney Island section of 
		Brooklyn.  Maybe that accounts for my 
		personality, which is a little nervous, I 
		think.

CUT TO:

Young Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men 
representing the Army, the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman 
in a skirted bathing suit.  They all turn and run toward the foreground.  The 
girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss.  The sign over the 
concession reads "Steve's Famous Clam Bar.  Ice Cold Beer, "and the roller 
coaster is moving in full gear in the background.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		You know, I have a hyperactive imagination.  
		My mind tends to jump around a little, and 
		have some trouble between fantasy and reality.

								CUT TO:

Full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other 
as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		My father ran the bumper-car concession. 
			(Alvy as a child moves into the frame 
			driving a bumper car.  He stops as other 
			cars bombard him.  His father continues 
			to direct the traffic) 
		There-there he is and there I am.  But I-I-I-I 
		used to get my aggression out through those 
		cars all the time.

Alvy backs up his car off screen.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY

The camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the 
blackboard.  The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures. 
While Alvy speaks, one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard.
- "2 X 10 = 20 " and other arithmetic formulas.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		I remember the staff at our public 
		school.  You know, we had a saying, uh, 
		that "Those who can't do, teach, and 
		those who can't teach, teach gym." And 
		...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't 
		do anything, I think, were assigned to 
		our school.  I must say-

								CUT TO:

A female teacher standing in front of an old-fashioned schoolroom.  The 
blackboard behind her reads "Transportation Administration. The camera pans 
her point of view: a group of young students sitting behind their desks.  Alvy 
as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student activity;
there is note-passing, ruler-tapping, nose-picking, gumchewing.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		I always felt my schoolmates were idiots.  
		Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little 
		face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss 
		Perfect all the time.  And-and Ivan 
		Ackerman, always the wrong answer.  Always. 

Ivan stands up behind his desk.

				IVAN 
		Seven and three is nine.

Alvy hits his forehead with his hand.  Another student glances over at him, 
reacting.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Even then I knew they were just jerks. 
			(The camera moves back to the teacher, 
			who is glaring out at her students) 
		In nineteen forty-two I had already dis-

As Alvy talks, the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl.  
She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to 
his seat.

				1ST GIRL 
			(Making noises) 
		Ugh, he kissed me, he kissed me.

				TEACHER 
			(Off screen) 
		That's the second time this month!  Step 
		up here!

As the teacher, really glaring now, speaks, Alvy rises from his seat and moves 
over to her.  Angry, she points with her band while the students turn their 
heads to watch what will happen next.

				ALVY 
		What'd I do?

				TEACHER 
		Step up here!

				ALVY 
		What'd I do?

				TEACHER 
		You should be ashamed of yourself.

The students, their heads still turned, look back at Alvy, now an adult, 
sitting in the last seat of the second row.

				ALVY (AS ADULT) 
			(First off screen, then onscreen as 
			camera moves over to the back of the 
			classroom) 
		Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual 
		curiosity.

				TEACHER 
			(The younger, Alvy standing next to her) 
		Six-year-old boys don't have girls on 
		their minds.

				ALVY (AS ADULT) 
			(Still sitting in the back of 
			the classroom) 
		I did. 

The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and 
speaks.

				1ST GIRL 
		For God's sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks 
		of a latency period.

				ALVY (AS ADULT) 
			(Gesturing) 
		Well, I never had a latency period.  I 
		can't help it.

				TEACHER
			(With young, Alvy still at her side) 
		Why couldn't you have been more like Donald? 
			(The camera pans over to Donald, 
			sitting up tall in his seat, then 
			back to the teacher) 
		Now, there was a model boy!

				ALVY (AS CHILD) 
			(Still standing next to the teacher) 
		Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.

				DONALD 
		I run a profitable dress company.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Right.  Sometimes I wonder where my 
		classmates are today.

The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, 
the teacher standing in the front of the room.  One at a time, the young 
students rise u from their desks and speak.

				1ST BOY 
		I'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

				2ND BOY 
		I sell tallises.

				3RD BOY 
		I used to be a heroin addict.  Now I'm a 
		methadone addict. 

				2ND GIRL 
			I'm into leather.

INT. ROOM

Close-up of a TV screen showing Alvy as an adult on a talk show.  He sits next 
to the show, host, Dick Cavett, a Navy man sits on his right.  Static is heard 
throughout the dialogue.

				ALVY 
		I lost track of most of my old schoolmates, 
		but I wound up a comedian.  They did not take 
		me in the Army.  I was, uh ... Interestingly 
		enough, I was-I was four-P.

Sounds of TV audience laughter and applause are heard.

				DICK CAVETT 
		Four-P?

				ALVY 
		Yes.  In-in-in-in the event of war, I'm a 
		hostage.

More audience laughter joined by Dick Cavett and the naval officer.

INT. THE HOUSE WHERE ALVY GREW UP

Alvy's  mother sits at the old-fashioned dining-room table peeling carrots and 
talking as she looks off screen.

				MOTHER 
		You always only saw the worst in people.  
		You never could get along with anyone at 
		school.  You were always outta step with the 
		world.  Even when you got famous, you still 
		distrusted the world.'

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET-DAY

A pretty Manhattan street with sidewalk trees, brownstones, a school; people 
mill about, some strolling and carrying bundles, others buried.  The screen 
shows the whole length of the sidewalk, a street, and part of the sidewalk 
beyond.  As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in 
the distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, 
as Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation.  They eventually move 
past the camera and off screen.  Traffic noise is heard in the background.

				ALVY 
		I distinctly heard it.  He muttered under 
		his breath, "Jew." 

				ROB 
		You're crazy!

				ALVY 
		No, I'm not.  We were walking off the 
		tennis court, and you know, he was there 
		and me and his wife, and he looked at her 
		and then they both looked at me, and under 
		his breath he said, "Jew."

				ROB 
		Alvy, you're a total paranoid.

				ALVY 
		Wh- How am I a paran-?  Well, I pick up on 
		those kind o' things.  You know, I was 
		having lunch with some guys from NBC, so 
		I said ... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" 
		and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" 
		Not, did you, didchoo eat?  Jew?  No, not 
		did you eat, but Jew eat?  Jew.  You get it?  
		Jew eat?

				ROB 
		Ah, Max, you, uh ...

				ALVY 
		Stop calling me Max.

				ROB 
		Why, Max?  It's a good name for you.  Max, 
		you see conspiracies in everything.

				ALVY 
		No, I don't!  You know, I was in a record 
		store.  Listen to this -so I know there's 
		this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and 
		he's lookin' at me in a funny way and 
		smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a 
		sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, 
		Wagner-so I know what he's really tryin' 
		to tell me very significantly Wagner. 

				ROB 
		Right, Max.  California, Max.

				ALVY 
		Ah.

				ROB 
		Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.

				ALVY 
		Forget it, Max.

				ROB 
		-we move to sunny L.A. All of show business 
		is out there, Max.

				ALVY
		No, I cannot.  You keep bringing it up, but 
		I don't wanna live in a city where the only 
		cultural advantage is that you can make a 
		right turn on a red light.

				ROB
			(Checking his watch) 
		Right, Max, forget it.  Aren't you gonna be 
		late for meeting Annie?

				ALVY 
		I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman.  
		I think I have a few minutes left.  Right?

EXT. BEEKMAN THEATER-DAY

Alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him 
just inside the glass doors.  The sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, 
can be heard while he looks around waiting for, Annie. A man in a black leather
jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, Alvy.  He looks at him, 
then moves away.  He stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at Alvy
again.  Alvy looks away, then back at the man.  The man continues to stare. 
Alvy scratches his head, looking for Annie and trying not to notice the man. 
The man, still staring, walks back to Alvy.

				1ST MAN 
		Hey, you on television?

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head) 
		No. Yeah, once in a while.  You know, 
		like occasionally.

				1ST MAN 
		What's your name?

				ALVY 
			(Clearing his throat) 
		You wouldn't know it.  It doesn't matter.  
		What's the difference?

				1ST MAN 
		You were on ... uh, the ... uh, the Johnny 
		Carson, right?  

				ALVY 
		Once in a while, you know.  I mean, you 
		know, every now-

				1ST MAN 
		What's your name?

Alvy  is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks; more and more people 
move through the doors of the theater.

				ALVY 
			(Nervously) 
		I'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford. 

				1ST MAN 
			(Laughing) 
		Come on.

				ALVY
		Alvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks 
		very much ... for everything.

They shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm.  The man in turn looks over his 
shoulder and motions to another man. All excited now, he points to Alvy and 
calls out. Alvy looks impatient.

				1ST MAN 
		Hey!

				2ND MAN 
			(Off screen) 
		What?

				1ST MAN 
		This is Alvy Singer!

				ALVY 
		Fellas ... you know-Jesus!  Come on!

				1ST MAN 
			(Overlapping, ignoring Alvy) 
		This guy's on television!  Alvy
		Singer, right?  Am I right?

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping 1st man) 
		Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break.
		Jesus Christ!

				1ST MAN 
			(Still ignoring Alvy's protestations) 
		This guy's on television.

				ALVY 
		I need a large polo mallet!

				2ND MAN 
			(Moving into the screen) 
		Who's on television?

				1ST MAN
		This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.

				ALVY 
			(Annoyed) 
		Fellas, what is this-a meeting o' the 
		teamsters?  You know.. .

				2ND MAN 
			(Also ignoring Alvy) 
		What program?

				1ST MAN 
			(Holding out a matchbook) 
		Can I have your autograph?

				ALVY 
		You don't want my autograph.

				1ST MAN 
			(Overlapping, Alvy's  speech) 
		Yeah, I do.  It's for my girl friend.  
		Make it out to Ralph.

				ALVY 
			(Taking the matchbook and pen and 
			writing) 
		Your girl friend's name is Ralph?

				1ST MAN 
		It's for my brudder. 
			(To passersby) 
		Alvy Singer!  Hey!  This is Alvy-

				2ND MAN 
			(To Alvy, overlapping 1st man's speech) 
		You really Alvy Singer, the ... the 
		TV star?

Nodding his head yes, Alvy shoves 2nd man aside and moves to the curb of the 
sidewalk.  The two men follow, still talking over the traffic noise.

				1ST MAN 
		-Singer!

				2ND MAN 
		Alvy Singer over here!

A cab moves into the frame and stops by the curb.  Alvy moves over to it about 
to get in.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the two men and 
			stuttering) 
		I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas. 
			(As Alvy opens the cab door, the 
			two men still behind him, Annie 
			gets out) 
		Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of 
		the Panama Canal?

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping Alvy) 
		Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?  

Annie closes the cab door and she and Alvy move over to the ticket booth of 
the theater as they continue to talk.

				ALVY 
		Bad mood?  I'm standing with the cast of 
		"The Godfather."

				ANNIE 
		You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.

				ALVY 
		Deal!  I'm dealing with two guys named 
		Cheech!

				ANNIE 
		Okay. 
			(They move into the ticket line, 
			still talking.  A billboard next to 
			them reads "INGMAR BERGMAN'S 'FACE 
			TO FACE ,'LIV ULLMANN") 
		Please, I have a headache, all right?

				ALVY 
		Hey, you are in a bad mood.  You-you-
		you must be getting your period.

				ANNIE 
		I'm not getting my period.  Jesus, every 
		time anything out of the ordinary happens, 
		you think that I'm getting my period!

They move over to the ticket counter, people in front of them buying tickets 
and walking off screen.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		A li-little louder.  I think one of them 
		may have missed it! 
			(To the ticket clerk) 
		H'm, has the picture started yet?

				TICKET CLERK 
		It started two minutes ago.

				ALVY 
			(Hitting his hand on the counter) 
		That's it!  Forget it!  I-I can't go in.

				ANNIE 
		Two minutes, Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie)
		No, I'm sorry, I can't do it.  We-we've 
		blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I 
		can't go in in the middle.

				ANNIE 
		In the middle? 
			(Alvy nods his head yes and let's
			out an exasperated sigh) 
		We'll only miss the titles.  They're in 
		Swedish.

				ALVY 
		You wanna get coffee for two hours or 
		something?  We'll go next-

				ANNIE 
		Two hours?  No, u-uh, I'm going in.  
		I'm going in. 

She moves past the ticket clerk.

				ALVY 
			(Waving to Annie) 
		Go ahead.  Good-bye. 

Annie moves back to Alvy and takes his arm.

				ANNIE 
		Look, while we're talking we could be 
		inside, you know that?

				ALVY 
			(Watching people with tickets move 
			past them) 
		Hey, can we not stand here and argue in 
		front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.

				ANNIE 
		Alright.  All right, all right, so whatta 
		you wanna do?

				ALVY 
		I don't know now.  You-you wanna go to 
		another movie? 
			(Annie nods her head and shrugs 
			her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, 
			gesturing with his band, looks at 
			her) 
		So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, come on, we've seen it.  I'm not in 
		the mood to see a four-hour documentary 
		on Nazis.

				ALVY 
		Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't ... I-I-I've 
		gotta see a picture exactly from the start 
		to the finish, 'cause-'cause I'm anal.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing now) 
		H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.

INT. THEATER LOBBY.

A lined-up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater, Alvy and 
Annie among them.  A bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing
scene.

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Loudly to his companion right 
			behind Alvy and Annie) 
		We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.  
		It is not one of his best.  It lacks a 
		cohesive structure.  You know, you get 
		the feeling that he's not absolutely sure 
		what it is he wants to say.  'Course, I've 
		always felt he was essentially a-a technical 
		film maker.  Granted, La Strada was a great 
		film.  Great in its use of negative energy 
		more than anything else.  But that simple 
		cohesive core ... 

Alvy, reacting to the man's loud monologue, starts to get annoyed, while Annie 
begins to read her newspaper.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the man's speech) 
		I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.

				ANNIE 
			(Reading) 
		Well, stop listening to him.

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Overlapping Alvy and Annie) 
		You know, it must need to have had its 
		leading from one thought to another.  
		You know what I'm talking about?

				ALVY 
			(Sighing) 
		He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

				MAN IN LINE 
		Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or 
		Satyricon, I found it incredibly ... 
		indulgent.  You know, he really is.  He's 
		one of the most indulgent film makers.  He 
		really is-

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		Key word here is "indulgent."

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Overlapping) 
		-without getting ... well, let's put it 
		this way ...

				ALVY 
			(To Annie, who is still reading, 
			overlapping the man in line who is 
			still talking) 
		What are you depressed about?

				ANNIE 
		I missed my therapy.  I overslept.

				ALVY  
		How can you possibly oversleep?

				ANNIE 
		The alarm clock.

				ALVY 
			(Gasping) 
		You know what a hostile gesture that is 
		to me?

				ANNIE 
		I know-because of our sexual problem, 
		right?

				ALVY 
		Hey, you ... everybody in line at the 
		New Yorker has to know our rate of 
		intercourse?

				MAN IN LINE
		- It's like Samuel Beckett, you know-
		I admire the technique but he doesn't ... 
		he doesn't hit me on a gut level.

				ALVY 
			(To Annie) 
		I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.

The man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie talk.

				ANNIE 
		Stop it, Alvy!

				ALVY 
			(Wringing his hands) 
		Well, he's spitting on my neck!  You know, 
		he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

				MAN IN LINE 
		And then, the most important thing of all 
		is a comedian's vision.

				ANNIE 
		And you know something else?  You know, 
		you're so egocentric that if I miss my 
		therapy you can think of it in terms of 
		how it affects you!

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Lighting a cigarette while he talks) 
		Gal gun-shy is what it is.

				ALVY
			(Reacting again to the man in line) 
		Probably on their first date, right?

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Still going on) 
		It's a narrow view.

				ALVY
		Probably met by answering an ad in the 
		New York Review of Books.  "Thirtyish 
		academic wishes to meet woman who's 
		interested in Mozart, James Joyce and 
		sodomy." 
			(He sighs; then to Annie) 
		Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?

				ANNIE 
		Oh!

				ALVY  
		I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal 
		for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

				ANNIE 
		Okay, I'm very sorry.  My sexual problem!  
		Okay, my sexual problem!  Huh?

The man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away.

				ALVY 
		I never read that.  That was-that was 
		Henry James, right?  Novel, uh, the 
		sequel to Turn of the Screw?  My Sexual ...

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Even louder now) 
		It's the influence of television.  Yeah, 
		now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms 
		of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, 
		you understand?  A hot medium ... as opposed 
		to a ...

				ALVY 
			(More and more aggravated) 
		What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' 
		horse manure.

				MAN IN LINE     
		... as opposed to a print ...

Alvy steps forward, waving his hands in frustration, and stands facing the 
camera.

				ALVY 
			(Sighing and addressing the audience) 
		What do you do when you get stuck in a movie 
		line with a guy like this behind you?  I mean, 
		it's just maddening!

The man in line moves toward Alvy.  Both address the audience now.

				MAN IN LINE 
		Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion?  
		It's a free country!

				ALVY 
		I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta 
		give it so loud?  I mean, aren't you ashamed 
		to pontificate like that?  And-and the funny 
		part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't
		know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work!

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Wait a minute!  Really?  Really?  I happen to 
		teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media 
		and Culture"!  So I think that my insights 
		into Mr. McLuhan-well, have a great deal of 
		validity.

				ALVY 
		Oh, do yuh?

				MAN IN LINE 
		Yes.

				ALVY 
		Well, that's funny, because I happen to 
		have Mr. McLuhan right here.  So ... so, 
		here, just let me-I mean, all right.  Come 
		over here ... a second.

Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back 
of the crowded lobby.  He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and 
pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster.

				MAN IN LINE 
		Oh.

				ALVY 
			(To McLuban) 
		Tell him.

				MCLUHAN 
			(To the man in line) 
		I hear-I heard what you were saying.  
		You-you know nothing of my work.  You 
		mean my whole fallacy is wrong.  How you 
		ever got to teach a course in anything is 
		totally amazing.

				ALVY 
			(To the camera) 
		Boy, if life were only like this!

INT. BEDROOM-NIGHT 

Annie is sitting up in bed reading.

				ALVY 
			(Off screen) 
		Boy, those guys in the French Resistance 
		were really brave, you know?  Got to listen 
		to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

				ANNIE 
		M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself 
		how I'd stand up under torture.

				ALVY 
			(Off screen) 
		You?  You kiddin'? 
			(He moves into the frame, lying across 
			the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a 
			face) 
		If the Gestapo would take away your 
		Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em 
		everything.

				ANNIE 
		That movie makes me feel guilty.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.

He starts kissing Annie's arm.  She gets annoyed and continues to read.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, I ...

				ALVY 
		What-what-what-what's the matter?

				ANNIE 
		I-you know, I don't wanna.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie, reacting) 
		What-what-I don't ... It's not natural!  
		We're sleeping in a bed together.  You 
		know, it's been a long time.

				ANNIE 
		I know, well, it's just that-you know, I 
		mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, 
		so I have to rest my voice.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie again) 
		It's always some kind of an excuse.  It's- 
		You know, you used to think that I was 
		very sexy.  What ... When we first started 
		going out, we had sex constantly ... We're-
		we're probably listed in the Guinness Book 
		of World Records.

				ANNIE 
			(Patting Alvy's band solicitously) 
		I know.  Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll 
		pass, it's just that I'm going through a 
		phase, that's all.

				ALVY 
		M'm.

				ANNIE 
		I mean, you've been married before, you 
		know how things can get.  You were very 
		hot for Allison at first.

								CUT TO:


INT. BACK STAGE OF AUDITORIUM - NIGHT.

Allison, clipboard in band, walks about the wings, stopping to talk to various 
people.  Musicians, performers and technicians mill about, busy with activity. 
Allison wears a large "ADLAI" button, as do the people around her.  The sounds 
of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally, 
interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience.  Allison 
stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear "ADLAI" buttons.

				ALLISON 
			(Looking down at the clipboard) 
		Ma'am, you're on right after this man ... 
		about twenty minutes, something like that.

				WOMAN 
		Oh, thank you.

Alvy moves into the frame behind Allison.  He taps her on the shoulder; she 
turns to face him.

				ALVY 
			(Coughing) 
		Excuse ... excuse me, when do I go on?

				ALLISON 
			(Looking down at the clipboard) 
		Who are you?

				ALVY
		Alvy ... Alvy Singer.  I'm a comedian.

				ALLISON 
		Oh, comedian.  Yes.  Oh, uh ... you're 
		on next.

				ALVY 
			(Rubbing his hands together 
			nervously) 
		What do you mean, next?

				ALLISON 
			(Laughing) 
		Uh ... I mean you're on right after 
		this act.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		No, it can't be, because he's a comic.

				ALLISON 
		Yes.

				ALVY 
		So what are you telling me, you're 
		putting on two comics in a row?

				ALLISON 
		Why not?

				ALVY  
		No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't 
		... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.

				ALLISON 
		It's okay.

				ALVY 
		No, because they're-they're laughing, so 
			(He starts laughing nervously) 
		I-I-I'd rather not.  If you don't mind, 
		I prefer-

				ALLISON 
			(Overlapping) 
		Will you relax, please?  They're gonna 
		love you, I know.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		I prefer not to, because ... look, 
		they're laughing at him.  See, so what 
		are yuh telling me-

They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings.

				ALLISON 
			(Overlapping) 
		Yes.

				ALVY 
(Overlapping) 
		-that I've got to ... ah ... ah ... 
		They're gonna laugh at him for a couple 
		minutes, then I gotta go out there, I 
		gotta ... get laughs, too.  How much can 
		they laugh? 
			(Off screen) 
		They-they they're laughed out.

				ALLISON 
			(Off screen) 
		Do you feel all right?

As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of 
view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai
Stevenson.  The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in 
clusters around the room.

The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage.  Alvy is swinging
his hands nervously.

				COMEDIAN 
			(Off screen, onstage) 
		You know ...

Alvy starts looking Allison up and down; people in the background mill about.

				ALVY 
			(Above the chatter around him) 
		Look, what's your-what's your name?

				COMEDIAN 
			(Off screen)  
		... General Eisenhower is not ...

				ALLISON 
			(Looking out at the stage) 
		Allison.

				ALVY   
		Yeah?  Allison what?

				ALLISON 
			(Still looking off screen) 
		Portchnik.

				COMEDIAN     
		... a group from the ...

				ALVY
			(Coughing) 
		Thank you. I-I don't know why they would 
		have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... 
			(He clears his throat) 
		Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political 
		comedian at all.

The audience starts to laugh.

				ALVY 
		I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... 
		a woman in the Eisenhower Administration 
		... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to 
		me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I 
		was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what 
		Eisenhower has been doing to the country 
		for the last eight years. 

The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage.

INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM.

Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing.  There are books all over the room; 
a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits 
on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him.

				ALVY  
		H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with 
		this, because it-I can't get it off my 
		mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!

				ALLISON 
		Well, I'm getting tired of it.  I need 
		your attention.

Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, 
gesturing with his hands.

				ALVY 
		It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense.  
		He drove past the book depository and the 
		police said conclusively that it was an 
		exit wound.  So-how is it possible for 
		Oswald to have fired from two angles at 
		once?  It doesn't make sense.

				ALLISON 
		Alvy.

Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs.  He then snaps his 
fingers and starts walking again.

				ALVY 
		I'll tell you this!  He was not marksman 
		enough to hit a moving target at that 
		range.  But ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		if there was a second assassin ... it- 
		That's it!

Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up 
from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.

				ALLISON 
		We've been through this.

				ALVY 
		If they-they recovered the shells from 
		that rifle.

				ALLISON 
			(Moving back to the bed and 
			lighting a cigarette) 
		Okay.  All right, so whatta yuh saying, 
		now?  That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren 
		Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?

				ALVY 
		Well, why not?

				ALLISON 
		Yeah, Earl Warren?

				ALVY 
			(Moving toward the bed) 
		Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

				ALLISON 
		Lyndon Johnson?

				ALVY 
			(Propping one knee on the bed 
			and gesturing) 
		L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a 
		politician.  You know the ethics those 
		guys have?  It's like-uh, a notch 
		underneath child molester.

				ALLISON 
		Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head) 
		Tsch.

				ALLISON 
		The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar 
		Hoover and oil companies and the 
		Pentagon and the men's-room attendant 
		at the White House?

Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking 
again.

				ALVY 
		I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room 
		attendant.

				ALLISON 
		You're using this conspiracy theory as 
		an excuse to avoid sex with me.

				ALVY 
		Oh, my God! 
			(Then, to the camera) 
		She's right!  Why did I turn off Allison 
		Portchnik?  She was-she was beautiful.  She 
		was willing.  She was real ... intelligent. 
			(Sighing) 
		Is it the old Groucho Marx joke?  That-that 
		I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that 
		would have someone like me for a member?

EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach 
house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the 
house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters 
crawling on the floor.  Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of 
groceries sit on the counter.  There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator. 

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, now don't panic.  Please.

				ALVY 
		Look, I told you it was a ... mistake 
		to ever bring a live thing in the house.

				ANNIE
		Stop it!  Don't ... don't do that!  There.
 
The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor.  Annie, bolding out a wooden 
paddle, tries to shove them onto it.

				ALVY 
		Well, maybe we should just call the police.  
		Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.

				ANNIE 
		Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for 
		God's sake. 

				ALVY 
		If they're only babies, then you pick 
		'em up.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, all right.  All right!  It's all 
		right.  Here.

She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail.  Laughing, 
she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.

				ALVY 
		Don't give it to me.  Don't!

				ANNIE 
			(Hysterically) 
		Oooh!  Here!  Here!

				ALVY 
			(Pointing) 
		Look!  Look, one crawled behind the 
		refrigerator.  It'll turn up in our bed 
		at night. 
			(They move over to the refrigerator; 
			Alvy moves as close to the wall as 
			possible as Annie, covering her mouth 
			and laughing hysterically, teasingly 
			dangles a lobster in front of him) 
		Will you get outta here with that thing?  
		Jesus!

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing, to the lobster) 
		Get him!

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		Talk to him.  You speak shellfish! 
			(He moves over to the stove and 
			takes the lid of a large steamer 
			filled with boiling water) 
		Hey, look ... put it in the pot.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I can't!  I can't put him in the pot.  I 
		can't put a live thing in hot water.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		Gimme!  Gimme!  Let me do it!  What-what's 
		he think we're gonna do, take him to the 
		movies?

Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it 
gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) 
		Oh, God!  Here yuh go!  Oh, good, now 
		he'll think- 
			(She screams) 
		Aaaah!  Okay.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie) 
		Okay, it's in.  It's definitely in the pot!

				ANNIE 
		All right.  All right.  All right.

She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster.  Smiling, 
she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to 
push it from the wall.

				ALVY 
		Annie, there's a big lobster behind 
		the refrigerator.  I can't get it out.  
		This thing's heavy.  Maybe if I put a 
		little dish of butter sauce here with a 
		nutcracker, it will run out the other 
		side, you know what I mean?

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Yeah.  I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna 
		get my camera.

				ALVY 
		You know, I-I think ... if I could pry 
		this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 
		'cause they don't have legs.  They don't 
		run around.

Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. 
Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the 
chandelier.  Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink.  
Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.

				ANNIE 
		Great!  Great! 
			(Screaming) 
		Goddammit! 
			(Screaming) 
		Ooooh!  These are ... p-p-p-pick this 
		lobster up.  Hold it, please!

				ALVY 
		All right!  All right!  All right!  All 
		right!  Whatta yuh mean?  Are yuh gonna 
		take pictures now?

				ANNIE 
		It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll 
		be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely!

				ALVY 
			(Picking up the lobster Annie 
			placed on the counter earlier) 
		All right, here!  Oh, God, it's disgusting!

Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and 
making a face.

				ANNIE 
		Don't be a jerk.  One more, Alvy, please, 
		one more picture. 
			(Reluctantly Alvy picks up the 
			lobster again as Annie takes 
			another picture) 
		Oh, oh, good, good!

EXT. OCEAN FRONT-DUSK.

The camera pans Annie and Alvy as they walk along the shore.

				ALVY 
		So, so-well, here's what I wanna know.  
		W-what ... 
			(He clears his throat) 
		Am I your first big romance?

				ANNIE 
		Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh.  No.

				ALVY 
		Well, then, w-who was?

				ANNIE 
		Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, 
		from Chippewa Falls High School. 

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK OF DENNIS LEANING AGAINST A CAR - NIGHT

Behind him is a movie theater with "MARILYN MONROE, 'MISFITS' " on the marquee.
He looks at his watch as the younger Annie, in a beehive hairdo, moves into the
frame.  They kiss quickly and look at each other, smiling.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(Off screen) 
		Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid 
		probably, would meetcha in front of the 
		movie house on Saturday night.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked 
		like then.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(Off screen, laughing) 
		Oh, I can imagine.  P-p-probably the 
		wife of an astronaut.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		Then there was Jerry, the actor.

								CUT TO:

FLASHBACK OF BRICK-WALLED APARTMENT - NIGHT

The younger, Annie and Jerry lean against the wall. Jerry is running his band 
down Annie's bare arm. Annie and Alvy walk into the room, observing the younger
Annie, in jeans and T-shirt, with Jerry.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(Laughing) 
		Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		I look pretty.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but 
		that guy with you ...

				JERRY 
		Acting is like an exploration of the soul. 
		I-it's very religious.  Uh, like, uh, a 
		kind of liberating consciousness.  It's 
		like a visual poem.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		Is he kidding with that crap?

				YOUNGER ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, right.  Right, yeah, I think I 
		know exactly what you mean, when you 
		say "religious."

				ALVY 
			(Incredulous, to Annie) 
		You do?

				ANNIE 
			(Still watching) 
		Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.

				ALVY 
		Hey, that was last year.

				JERRY 
		It's like when I think of dying.  You 
		know how I would like to die?

				YOUNGER ANNIE 
		No, how?

				JERRY 
		I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Heavy!  Eaten by some squirrels.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, 
		and look at him, he's neat-looking and he 
		was emotional ... Y-hey, I don't think you 
		like emotion too much.

Jerry stops rubbing the younger Annie's arm and slides down to the floor as 
she raises her foot toward his chest.

				JERRY 
		Touch my heart ... with your foot. 

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		I-I may throw up!

								CUT BACK TO:

EXTERIOR.  BEACH-DUSK

It's now sunset, the water reflecting the last light.  The camera moves over 
the scene.  The off screen voices of Alvy and Annie are heard as they walk, the
camera always one step ahead of them.

				ANNIE 
		He was creepy.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I 
		came along. 

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, really?  Well, la-de-da!

				ALVY 
		La-de-da.  If I-if anyone had ever told 
		me that I would be taking out a girl who 
		used expressions like "la-de-da" . . .

				ANNIE 
		Oh, that's right.  That you really like 
		those New York girls. 

				ALVY 
		Well, no ... not just, not only.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I'd say so.  You married-

INT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT-NIGHT

A cocktail party is in progress, the rooms crowded with guests as Alvy and 
Robin make their way through the people.  A waiter, carrying a tray, walks 
past them.  Alvy reaches out to pick up a glass; Robin reaches over and picks 
it of the tray first.  There is much low-key chatter in the background.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		-two of them.

				ROBIN 
		There's Henry Drucker.  He has a chair 
		in history at Princeton.  Oh, the short 
		man is Hershel Kaminsky.  He has a chair 
		in philosophy at Cornell.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, two more chairs and they got a 
		dining-room set.

				ROBIN 
		Why are you so hostile?

				ALVY 
			(Sighing) 
		'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on 
		television.

				ROBIN 
			(Squinting) 
		Is that Paul Goodman?  No. And be nice 
		to the host because he's publishing my 
		book.  Hi, Doug!  Douglas Wyatt.  
		"A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart."

They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped 
in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them.

				ALVY 
			(Taking Robin's hand) 
		I'm so tired of spending evenings making 
		fake insights with people who work for 
		Dysentery.

				ROBIN 
		Commentary.

				ALVY 
		Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and 
		Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.

				ROBIN 
		No jokes-these are friends, okay?

INT. BEDROOM

Alvy sits on the foot of the bed watching the Knicks game on television.

				TV ANNOUNCER 
			(Off screen) 
		Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New 
		York Knicks.

Robin enters the room, slamming the door.

				ROBIN 
		Here you are.  There's people out there.

				ALVY 
		Hey, you wouldn't believe this.  Two 
		minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen 
		points, and now ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		they're ahead two points.

				ROBIN 
		Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group 
		of pituitary cases trying to stuff the 
		ball through a hoop?

				ALVY 
			(Looking at Robin) 
		What's fascinating is that it's physical.  
		You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, 
		they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant 
		and have no idea what's going on.  But on the 
		other hand ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

Alvy reaches over, pulls Robin down onto the bed.  He kisses her and moves 
farther up on the bed.

				ROBIN 
		Stop acting out.

She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy.

				ALVY 
		No, it'll be great!  It'll be great, 
		be-because all those Ph.D.'s are in 
		there, you know, like ... discussing 
		models of alienation and we'll be in 
		here quietly humping.

He pulls Robin toward him, caressing her as she pulls herself away.

				ROBIN 
		Alvy, don't!  You're using sex to 
		express hostility.

				ALVY 
		"'Why-why do you always r-reduce my 
		animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?' 
			(Clears his throat) 
		he said as he removed her brassiere..."

				ROBIN 
			(Pulling away again) 
		There are people out there from The New 
		Yorker magazine.  My God!  What would they 
		think?

She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress.  She turns and moves toward the 
door.

INT. APARTMENT-NIGHT

Robin and Alvy are in bed.  The room is in darkness.  Outside, a siren starts 
blaring.

				ROBIN 
		Oh, I'm sorry!

				ALVY 
		Don't get upset!

				ROBIN 
		Dammit!  I was so close.

She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side.  Alvy turns to her.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		Jesus, last night it was some guy honking 
		his car horn.  I mean, the city can't 
		close down.  You know, what-whatta yuh 
		gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the 
		airport, too?  No more flights so we can 
		have sex?

				ROBIN 
			(Reaching over for her eyeglasses 
			on the night table) 
		I'm too tense.  I need a Valium.  My 
		analyst says I should live in the country 
		and not in New York.

				ALVY 
		Well, I can't li- We can't have this 
		discussion all the time.  The country 
		makes me nervous.  There's ... You got 
		crickets and it-it's quiet ... there's 
		no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, 
		there's the screens with the dead moths 
		behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the 
		Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and 
		Terry-

				ROBIN 
			(Interrupting) 
		Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm 
		too tense.  Where's the goddamn Valium?

She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed.

				ALVY 
		Hey, come on, it's quiet now.  We can-we 
		can start again.

				ROBIN 
		I can't.

				ALVY
		What-

				ROBIN
		My head is throbbing.

				ALVY
		Oh, you got a headache!

				ROBIN
		I have a headache.

				ALVY
		Bad?

				ROBIN
		Oswald and ghosts.

				ALVY
		Jesus!

He begins to get out of bed.

				ROBIN 
		Where are you going?

				ALVY 
		Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a 
		series of cold showers.

EXT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM OF THE TENNIS CLUB.

Rob and Alvy, carrying tennis rackets, come through the door of the locker 
room to the lobby.  They are dressed in tennis whites.  They walk toward the 
indoor court.

				ROB
 			Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to 
		the showers-

				ALVY
		Right, right, so g-get back to what we 
		were discussing, the failure of the 
		country to get behind New York City is-is 
		anti-Semitism.

				ROB 
		Max, the city is terribly worried.

				ALVY 
		But the- I'm not discussing politics or 
		economics.  This is foreskin.

				ROB 
		No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient 
		out.  Every time some group disagrees with 
		you it's because of anti-Semitism.

				ALVY 
		Don't you see?  The rest of the country looks 
		upon New York like we're-we're left-wing 
		Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers.  
		I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I 
		live here.

				ROB 
		Max, if we lived in California, we could 
		play outdoors every day, in the sun.

				ALVY 
		Sun is bad for yuh.  Everything our parents 
		said was good is bad.  Sun, milk, red meat, 
		college ...

INT. TENNIS COURT

Annie and Janet, in tennis whites, stand on the court holding tennis rackets 
and balls.  They are chattering and giggling.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I know, but ooh- here he comes.  Okay. 

Rob and Alvy enter the court and walk over to the two women.  Rob kisses Janet 
and makes introduction.

				ROB 
		You know Alvy?

				JANET 
		Oh, hi, Alvy.

				ANNIE 
			(To Rob) 
		How are yuh?

				ROB 
			(To Alvy) 
		You know Annie?

				JANET 
		I'm sorry.  This is Annie Hall.

				ALVY 
		Hi.

				ANNIE 
		Hi.

Annie and Alvy shake hands.

				JANET 
			(Laughing) 
		Alvy.

				ROB 
			(Eager to begin) 
		Who's playing who here?  Alvy Well, uh ... 
		you and me against them?

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping Alvy) 
		Well ... so ... I can't play too good, 
		you know.

				JANET 
			(Laughing) 
		I've had four lessons!

The group, laughing and chatting, divide up-Rob and Annie moving to the other 
side of the net, Alvy and Janet standing where they are.  They start to play 
mixed doubles, each taking turns and playing well. At one point in the game, 
Annie starts to talk to Rob, then turns and sees a ball heading toward her.

				ALVY  
			(Hitting the halt back) 
		Holy gods!

INT. LOBBY

Alvy, dressed, puts things into a gym bag.  One knee is on the bench and his 
back is turned from the entrance. Annie walks toward the entrance door dressed 
in street clothes and carrying her tennis bag over her shoulder.  Seeing Alvy,
she stops and turns.

				ANNIE 
		Hi.  Hi, hi.

				ALVY 
			(Looking over his shoulder) 
		Hi.  Oh, hi.  Hi.

				ANNIE 
			(Hands clasped in front of her, 
			smiling) 
		Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly 
		toward the door.

				ALVY 
			(Clearing his throat) 
		You-you play ... very well.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah?  So do you.  Oh, God, whatta-
			(Making sounds and laughing) 
		whatta dumb thing to say, right?  I mean, 
		you say it, "You play well," and right 
		away ... I have to say well.  Oh, oh ... 
		God, Annie. 
			(She gestures with her hand) 
		Well ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da, 
		la-la.

She turns around and moves toward the door.

				ALVY 
			(Still looking over his shoulder) 
		Uh ... you-you wanna lift?

				ANNIE 
			(Turning and aiming her thumb over 
			her shoulder) 
		Oh, why-uh ... y-y-you gotta car?

				ALVY 
		No, um ... I was gonna take a cab.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, no, I have a car.

				ALVY 
		You have a car? 
			(Annie smiles, hands folded in 
			front of her) 
		So ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		I don't understand why ... if you have a 
		car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do 
		you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?

				ANNIE 
		I don't ... 
			(Laughing) 
		I don't ... Geez, I don't know, I've ... 
		I wa- This ... yeah, I got this VW out 
		there ... 
			(Laughing and gesturing toward 
			the door) 
		What a jerk, yeah.  Would you like a lift?

				ALVY 
			(Zipping up his bag) 
		Sure.  W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?

				ANNIE 
		Me?  Oh, downtown!

				ALVY 
		Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.

				ALVY 
		Uh, well, you just said you were going 
		downtown.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah, well, I'm, but I ...

Alvy picks up his bag and moves toward the door. As he turns his bag around, 
the handle of the tennis racket bits Annie between the legs.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		So sorry.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I mean, I can go uptown, too.  I live 
		uptown, but ... uh, what the hell, I mean, 
		it'd be nice having company, you know 
		I mean, I hate driving alone.

				ALVY 
			(Making sounds) 
		Yeah.

They walk out the door.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET- DAY

Alvy and Annie in the VW as Annie speeds down a city street near the East River.

				ALVY 
		So, how long do you know Janet?  Where 
		do you know her from?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, I'm in her acting class.

				ALVY 
		Oh - you're an actress.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I do commercials, sort of ...

She zooms down the wrong lane, cars swerving out of her way.  A horn blows.

				ALVY 
		I, uh ... well, you're not from New 
		York, right?

				ANNIE 
		No, Chippewa Falls.

				ALVY 
		Right! 
			(A pause) 
		Where?

				ANNIE 
		Wisconsin.

				ALVY 
			(Finally reacting) 
		Uh, you're driving a-

				ANNIE 
		Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- 
			(A car moves closer to the VW, 
			almost on top of it in the wrong 
			direction.  Annie swerves away at 
			the very last minute)
		-a very good driver. 
			(Alvy rubs his head nervously, 
			staring out the window as Annie 
			speeds along) 
		So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?

Annie looks down beside her, searching for the gum.

				ALVY
		No, no thanks.  Hey, don't-

				ANNIE
		Well, where is it?  I-

				ALVY 
		No, no, no, no, you just ... just watch 
		the road.  I'll get it-

				ANNIE 
		Okay.

They both fumble around in her pocketbook.  Alvy looks up to see the entire 
front of a truck in Annie's windshield.  She swerves just in time.

				ALVY 
		-for yuh.

				ANNIE 
		Okay, that's good.

Alvy continues to look for the gum while Annie zooms down the city streets.

				ANNIE 
		All right.

				ALVY 
		I'll getcha a piece.

				ANNIE	
		Yeah ... so, listen-you drive?

				ALVY
		Do I drive?  Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta 
		problem with driving.

				ANNIE	
		Oh, you do?

				ALVY	
		Yeah.  I got, uh, I got a license but I 
		have too much hostility.

				ANNIE	
		Oh, right.

				ALVY	
		Nice car.

				ANNIE 
			(A bit rapidly)   
		Huh?

				ALVY 
		You keep it nice. 
			(He pulls a half-eaten sandwich 
			out of her bag) 
		Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?

				ANNIE 
		Huh?  Oh, yeah.

EXT. STREET-DAY

Cars are parked on both sides of the street as the VW rounds the corner.

				ANNIE 
		I live over here.  Oh, my God!  Look!  
		There's a parking space!  

With brakes squealing, Annie turns the VW sharply into the parking spot.  
Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car.

				ALVY   
		That's okay, you ... we-we can walk to 
		the curb from here.

				ANNIE 
		Don't be funny.

				ALVY   
		You want your tennis stuff?

				ANNIE 
		Huh?  Oh ... yeah.

				ALVY   
		You want your gear?  Here you go.

Alvy reaches into the back of the car and takes out tennis equipment.  He 
hands her her things.  People pass by on the street.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Well...

				ALVY 
			(Sighing) 
		Well, thanks, thank you.  You-you're 
		a wonderful tennis player.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh.

Alvy shakes hands with Annie.

				ALVY 
		You're the worst driver I've ever seen 
		in my life . . . that's including any place 
		... the worst ... Europe, United ... any 
		place ... Asia.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah.

				ALVY 
		And I love what you're wearin'.

Alvy touches the tie Annie is wearing around her neck.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, you do?  Yeah?  Oh, well, it's uh 
		... this is, uh ... this tie is a present, 
		from Grammy Hall.

Annie flips the bottom of the tie.

				ALVY  
		Who?  Grammy?  Grammy Hall?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing and nodding her head) 
		Yeah, my grammy.

				ALVY 
		You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you 
		do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah, I know.

				ALVY 
		Your grammy!

				ANNIE 
		I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?

				ALVY 
		Jesus, my-my grammy ... n-never gave 
		gifts, you know.  She-she was	too busy 
		getting raped by Cossacks.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Well ...

				ALVY	
		Well ... thank you again.

				ANNIE	
		Oh, yeah, yeah.

				ALVY	
		I'll see yuh.

				ANNIE	
			(Overlapping, gesturing) 
		Hey, well, listen ... hey, you wanna
		come upstairs and, uh ... and have a 
		glass of wine and something?  Aw, no, 
		I mean ... I mean, you don't have to, 
		you're probably late and everything else ...

				ALVY 
		No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure. 

				ANNIE 
		You sure?

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		No, I got time. 

				ANNIE 
		Okay.

				ALVY 
		Sure, I got ... I got nothing, uh, 
		nothing till my analyst's appointment.

They move toward Annie's apartment building.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, you see an analyst?

				ALVY 
		Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years. 

				ANNIE 
		Fifteen years?

				ALVY 
		Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more 
		year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.

				ANNIE 
		Fifteen-aw, come on, you're . . . yeah, 
		really?

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT

Alvy, standing, looks around the apartment.  There are lots of books, framed 
photographs on the white wall.  A terrace can be seen from the window.  He 
picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen 
carrying two glasses.  She hands them to Alvy.

				ALVY 
		Sylvia Plath.

				ANNIE 
		M'hm...

				ALVY
		Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide 
		was misinterpreted as romantic, by the 
		college-girl mentality.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah.

				ALVY 
		Oh, sorry.

				ANNIE 
		Right.  Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, 
		some of her poems seem - neat, you know.

				ALVY
		Neat?

				ANNIE 
		Neat, yeah.

				ALVY 
		Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen 
		seventy-five, you know that "neat" went 
		out, I would say, at the turn of the 
		century. 
			(Annie laughs) 
		Who-who are-who are those photos on 
		the wall?

				ANNIE 
			(Moving over to the photographs) 
		Oh ... oh, well, you see now now, uh, 
		that's my dad, that's Father-and that's 
		my ... brother, Duane.

				ALVY 
		Duane?

				ANNIE
			(Pointing) 
		Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is 
		Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.

				ALVY   
		Well, who's Sadie?

				ANNIE  
		Sadie?  Oh, well, Sadie... 
			(Laughing) 
		Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through 
		Grammy's brother George.  Uh, George was 
		real sweet, you know, he had that thing.  
		What is that thing where you, uh, where 
		you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a 
		sentence, you know-what is it?  Uh ...

				ALVY 
		Uh, narcolepsy.

				ANNIE
		Narcolepsy, right, right.  Right.  So, 
		anyway, so ... 
			(Laughing) 
		George, uh, went to the union, see, to 
		get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the 
		union always gave George this big turkey 
		at Christmas time because he was ... 
			(Annie points her fingers to each 
			side of her head, indicating George 
			was a little crazy) 
		shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the 
		First World War. 
			(Laughing hysterically, she opens 
			a cabinet door and takes out a 
			bottle of wine) 
		Anyway, so, so ... 
			(Laughing through the speech) 
		George is standing in line, oh, just a sec 
		...uh, getting his free turkey, but the 
		thing is, he falls asleep and he never 
		wakes up. So, so...
			(Laughing) 
		so, he's dead ... 
			(Laughing) 
		he's dead.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  Well, 
		terrible, huh, wouldn't you say?  I 
		mean, that's pretty unfortunate.

Annie unscrews the bottle of wine, silent now after her speech.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, it's a great story, though, I 
		mean, I... I ... it really made my day.  
		Hey, I think I should get outta here, 
		you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, 
		you know ...

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, really?  Oh, well ... uh, uh, maybe, 
		uh, maybe, we, uh ...

				ALVY 
		... and ... uh, yeah, uh ... uh, you 
		know, I-I-I... 

They move outside to the terrace, Alvy still holding the glasses, Annie the 
wine.  They stand in front of the railing, Annie pouring the wine into the 
held-out glasses.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.

				ALVY
		No, I know, but ... but, you know, I'm 
		all perspired and everything.

				ANNIE 
		Well, didn't you take, uh ... uh, a 
		shower at the club?

				ALVY
		Me?  No, no, no, 'cause I never shower 
		in a public place.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Why not?

				ALVY 
		'Cause I don't like to get naked in front 
		of another man, you know-it's, uh ...

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, I see, I see.

				ALVY 
		You know, I don't like to show my body 
		to a man of my gender-

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I see.  I guess-

				ALVY	
		-'cause, uh, you never know what's 
		gonna happen.

				ANNIE	
			(Sipping her wine and laughing) 
		Fifteen years, huh?

				ALVY
		Fifteen years, yeah.

				ANNIE	
		Yeah.  Oh, God bless!

They	put their glasses together in a toast.

				ALVY
		God bless.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Well, uh ... 
			(Pausing) 
		You're what Grammy Hall would call a 
		real Jew.

				ALVY  
			(Clearing his throat) 
		Oh, thank you.

				ANNIE
			(Smiling) 
		Yeah, well ... you-She hates Jews.  She 
		thinks that they just make money, but let 
		me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, 
		is she ever.  I'm tellin' yuh.

				ALVY 
			(pointing toward the apartment 
			after a short pause) 
		So, did you do shoot the photographs 
		in there or what?

				ANNIE
			(Nodding, her hand on her hip) 
		Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

Annie's thoughts pop on the screen as she talks: I dabble?  Listen to me-what 
a jerk!

				ALVY 
		They're ... they're... they're wonderful, 
		you know.  They have ... they have, uh 
		... a ... a quality.
	
As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl

				ANNIE
		Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take 
		a serious photography course soon.

Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo

				ALVY 
		Photography's interesting, 'cause, you 
		know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, 
		uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have 
		not emerged yet.

And Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked?

				ANNIE 
		Aesthetic criteria?  You mean, whether 
		it's, uh, good photo or not?

I'm not smart enough for him.  Hang in there

				ALVY 
		The-the medium enters in as a condition 
		of the art form itself.  That's-

I don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow

				ANNIE 
		Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, 
		it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you 
		know.  I mean, I just try to uh, feel 
		it, you know?  I try to get a sense of 
		it and not think about it so much.

God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others

				ALVY 
		Still, still we- You need a set of 
		aesthetic guide lines to put it in 
		social perspective, I think.

Christ, I sound like FM radio.  Relax

They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping.  The sounds of 
distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace.  Annie, laughing, 
speaks first.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I don't know.  I mean, I guess-I 
		guess you must be sorta late, huh?

				ALVY 
		You know, I gotta get there and begin 
		whining soon ... otherwise I- Hey ... 
		well, are you busy Friday night?

				ANNIE 
		Me?  Oh, uh.         
			(Laughing) 
		No.

				ALVY 
			(Putting his band on his forehead) 
		Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have 
		something.  Well, what about Saturday 
		night?

				ANNIE 
			(Nodding) 
		Oh ... nothing.  Not-no, no!

				ALVY 
		Oh, you ... you're very popular, I can see.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I know.

				ALVY 
		Gee, boy, what do you have?  You have 
		plague?

				ANNIE	
		Well, I mean, I meet a lot of ... jerks, 
		you know-

				ALVY
		Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.

				ANNIE	
			(Overlapping) 
		-what I mean?

				ALVY	
		I think that's, uh-

				ANNIE
			(Interrupting) 
		But I'm thinking about getting some 
		cats, you know, and then they ... Oh, 
		wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean 
			(Laughing) 
		oh, shoot!  No, Saturday night I'm 
		gonna-
			(Laughing) 
		gonna sing.  Yeah.

				ALVY
		You're gonna sing?  Do you sing?  Well, 
		no, it isn't
			(Overlapping) 
		No kidding? 
			(Overlapping) 
		-this is my first time.  Oh, really?  Where?  
		I'd like to come. 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, no, no, no, no, no!  No, I'm interested!

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning 
		sort of at club.  I don't-

				ALVY
			(Overlapping) 
		No, so help me.

				ANNIE
			(Overlapping) 
		-it's my first time.

				ALVY
		That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what 
		that's like.  Listen-

				ANNIE
			(Interrupting) 
		Yeah.

				ALVY
			(Overlapping) 
		-you're gonna like night clubs, they're 
		really a lotta fun.

INT. NIGHT CLUB-NIGHT

Annie stands on center stage with a microphone, a pianist behind her.  A 
Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness.  There 
are the typical sounds and movements of a nightclub audience: low conversation,
curling smoke, breaking glass, microphone bum, moving chairs, waiters 
clattering trays, a ringing phone as Annie sings "It Had to Be You.

EXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT.

Alvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk. 

				ANNIE 
		I was awful.  I'm so ashamed!  I can't 
		sing. 

				ALVY 
		Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad 
		restless.

				ANNIE 
		Whatta you mean, a tad restless?  Oh, 
		my God, I mean, they hated me.

				ALVY 
		No, they didn't.  You have a wonderful 
		voice.

				ANNIE 
		No, I'm gonna quit!

				ALVY
		No, I'm not gonna letcha.  You have a 
		great voice.

				ANNIE
		Really, do you think so, really?

				ALVY
		Yeah!

				ANNIE
		Yeah?

				ALVY
		It's terrific.

				ANNIE
			(Overlapping) 
		Yeah, you know something?  I never even 
		took a lesson, either.

They stop in the middle of the sidewalk.  Alvy turns Annie around to face him.

				ALVY 
		Hey, listen, listen.

				ANNIE
 			What?

				ALVY
		Gimme a kiss.

				ANNIE
 			Really?

				ALVY
		Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna 
		go home later, right?

				ANNIE
		Yeah.

				ALVY
		And-and uh, there's gonna be all that 
		tension.  You know, we never kissed before 
		and I'll never know when to make the right 
		move or anything.  So we'll kiss now we'll 
		get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?  

				ANNIE
  			Oh, all right.

				ALVY 
		And we'll digest our food better.

				ANNIE
 			Okay.

				ALVY 
		Okay?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

They kiss.

				ALVY 
		So now we can digest our food.  

They turn and start walking again.  

				ANNIE 
		We can digest our-

				ALVY 
		Okay. Yeah.

INT. DELI-NIGHT

Annie and Alvy sit down in a booth.  The deli is fairly well lit and crowded. 
Conversation, plates clattering, can be heard over the dialogue.  The waiter 
comes over to them to take their order.

				ALVY 
			(To the waiter) 
		I'm gonna have a corned beef.

				ANNIE 
			(To the waiter) 
		Yeah ... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a 
		pastrami on white bread with, uh, 
		mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. 
			(Alvy involuntarily makes a face 
			as the waiter leaves) 
		Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you 
		and, uh, were you depressed about that?

				ALVY 
		Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't 
		cure.

				ANNIE 
		Oh.  And your first wife was Allison?

				ALVY 
		My first... Yes, she was nice, but you 
		know, uh, it was my fault.  I was just... 
		I was too crazy.

				ANNIE 
		Oh.

INT. DARKENED BEDROOM-NIGHT

Alvy and Annie in bed together.

				ANNIE
		M'm, that was so nice.  That was nice.

				ALVY
		As Balzac said ...

				ANNIE
 			H'm?

				ALVY
  			"There goes another novel." 
			(They laugh) 
		Jesus, you were great.

				ANNIE
 			Oh, yeah?

				ALVY
 			Yeah.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.

				ANNIE
		No. 
			(She turns and looks at Alvy, 
			then laughs) 
		You're a wreck.

				ALVY
 			Really.  I mean it.  I-I'll never play 
		the piano again.

				ANNIE
 				(Lighting a joint and laughing) 
		You're really nuts.  I don't know, you 
		really thought it was good?  Tell me.

				ALVY
		Good?  I was-

				ANNIE
			(Overlapping) 
		No.

				ALVY
		No, that was the most fun I've ever 
		had without laughing.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Here, you want some?

				ALVY
		No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any 
		major hallucinogenics because I took 
		a puff like five years ago at a party and

				ANNIE
 			Yeah?

				ALVY
 			-tried to take my pants off over my 
		head ... 
			(Annie laughs)
		...  my ear.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I don't know, I don't really.  I 
		don't do it very often, you know, just 
		sort of, er ... relaxes me at first.

				ALVY 
		M'hm. 
			(He pushes himself up from the 
			bed and looks down at Annie)
		You're not gonna believe this, but-

				ANNIE
 			What?  What?

								CUT TO:


INT. BOOKSTORE-DAY

Annie and Alvy browsing in crowded bookstore.  Alvy, carrying two books, 
"Death and Western Thought" and "The Denial of Death", moves over to where 
Annie is looking.

				ALVY
		Hey?

				ANNIE
 			H'm?

				ALVY
 			I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I 
		think, because I-I think you should 
		read them.  You know, instead of that 
		cat book.

				ANNIE
 				(Looking at the books Alvy 
			is bolding) 
		That's, uh ... 
			(Laughing) 
		that's pretty serious stuff there.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, 
		I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, 
		I think.  Big-

				ANNIE
 				(Overlapping) 
		Yeah?

				ALVY
 			-big subject with me, yeah.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah?

They move over to the cashier line.

				ALVY
			(Gesturing) 
		I've a very pessimistic view of life.  
		You should know this about me if we're 
		gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that 
		life is-is divided up into the horrible 
		and the miserable.

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY
		Those are the two categories ...

				ANNIE 
		M'hm.

				ALVY    
		... you know, they're- The-the horrible 
		would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal 
		cases, you know?

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY    
		And blind people, crippled ...

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				ALVY
    			I don't-don't know how they get through 
		life.  It's amazing to me.

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY
 			You know, and the miserable is everyone 
		else.  That's-that's all.  So-so when 
		you go through life you should be thankful 
		that you're miserable, because that's- 
		You're very lucky ... to be ... 
			(Overlapping Annie's laughter) 
		... to be miserable.

				ANNIE
 			U-huh.

EXT. PARK-DAY

It's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park.  People are sitting on benches, 
others strolling, some walking dogs.  One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons.
Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before
them.  An older man and woman walk into view.

				ALVY
		Look, look at that guy.

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY
		There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. 
		When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, 
		you know? 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		He's the latest! just came back from 
		the gin-rummy farm last night. He 
		placed third.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		M'hm.  Yeah.  Yeah.

The camera shows them sitting side by side relaxed on a bench.

				ALVY 
			(Watching two men approach, one 
			lighting a cigar) 
		Look at these guys.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY   
		Oh, that's hilarious.  They're back 
		from Fire Island.  They're ... they're 
		sort of giving it a chance-you know what 
		I mean?

				ANNIE
   			Oh! Italian, right?

				ALVY 
  			Yeah, he's the Mafia.  Linen Supply Business 
		or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Oh, yeah.

				ALVY 
		No, I'm serious. 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		I just got my mustache wet.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah?

				ALVY 
			(As another man walks by) 
		And there's the winner of the Truman 
		Capote look-alike contest.

EXT. STREET-NIGHT

Alvy and Annie walk almost in silhouette along the dock, the New York City 
skyline in the background.  Alvy has his arm around Annie and they walk slowly.
No one else is around.

				ANNIE	
		You see, like you and I ...

				ALVY	
		You are extremely sexy.

				ANNIE	
		No, I'm not.

				ALVY	
		Unbelievably sexy.  Yes, you are.  
		Because ... you know what you are?  
		You're-you're polymorphously perverse.

				ANNIE	
		Well, what does-what does that mean?  
		I don't know what that is.

				ALVY 
		Uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional 
		in bed because you got -you get pleasure 
		in every part of your body when I touch you.

				ANNIE 
		Ooooh!

They stop walking.  Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him.  The 
South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background.

				ALVY 
		You know what I mean?  Like the tip 
		o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth 
		or your kneecaps ... you get excited.

				ANNIE 
		Come on. 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah.  You know what?  You know, I 
		like you, I really mean it.  I really do 
		like you.

				ALVY
		You- Do you love me?

				ANNIE
		Do I love you?

				ALVY
		That's the key question.

				ANNIE
		Yeah.

				ALVY
		I know you've only known me a short 
		while.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I certainly ... I think that's 
		very- Yeah, yeah ... 
			(Laughing) 
		yeah.  Do you love me?

				ALVY
 			I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word 
		for what...

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY
		- I ... I love you. 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you. 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
			(Putting his arms around her neck) 
		Don't you think I do?

				ANNIE
 			I dunno.

They kiss as a foghorn sounds in the distance.

INT. ALVY'S APARTMENT

Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is 
filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures.  They both carry 
cartons.

				ALVY
 			Whatta you mean?  You're not gonna give 
		up your own apartment, are you?

				ANNIE
			(Putting down the carton) 
		Of course.

				ALVY
		Yeah, bu-bu-but why?

				ANNIE
		Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, 
		that's why.

				ALVY
		Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.

				ANNIE
		I have a tiny apartment.

				ALVY
     			Yeah, I know it's small.

				ANNIE 
			(Picking up the suitcases and 
			walking into the bedroom) 
		That's right, and it's got bad plumbing 
		and bugs.

				ALVY
			(Picking up some pictures and 
			following Annie into the bedroom) 
		All right, granted, it has bad plumbing 
		and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a 
		negative thing.  You know, bugs are-are-uh, 
		entomology is a ... 
			(Annie, reacting, tosses the 
			suitcases and some loose clothing 
			onto the bed.  She sits down on the 
			edge, looking away. Alvy walks in, 
			pictures and carton in band, still 
			talking) 
		... rapidly growing field.

				ANNIE
		You don't want me to live with you?

				ALVY 
		How- I don't want you to live with me?  
		How- Whose idea was it?

				ANNIE 
		Mine.

				ALVY 
		Ye-ah.  Was it ... It was yours actually, 
		but, uh, I approved it immediately.

				ANNIE 
		I guess you think that I talked you into 
		something, huh?
			(putting pictures on the mantel) 
		
				ALVY
		No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, 
		we sleep together, we eat together.  Jesus, 
		you don't want it to be like we're married, 
		do yuh?

He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in.  He 
starts tossing books off screen.

				ANNIE
			(Looking up at Alvy) 
		How is it any different?

				ALVY  
			(Gesturing) 
		It's different 'cause you keep your own 
		apartment. 
			(Holding a book, he starts walking 
			around the room) 
		Because you know it's there, we don't 
		have to go to it, we don't have to deal 
		with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating 
		life raft ... that we know that we're not 
		married.

He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat.

				ANNIE  
			(Still sitting on the bed) 
		That little apartment is four hundred 
		dollars a month, Alvy.

				ALVY   
			(Looking at Annie) 
		That place is four hundred dollars a month?

				ANNIE  
		Yes, it is.  

				ALVY 
			(Whistling) 
		It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs.  Jesus, 
		I'll-My accountant will write it off as a 
		tax deduction, I'll pay for it.

				ANNIE 
			(Shaking her head) 
		You don't think I'm smart enough to be 
		serious about.

				ALVY  
		Hey, don't be ridiculous.

Alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie.

				ANNIE  
		Then why are you always pushing me to take 
		those college courses like I was dumb or 
		something?

				ALVY  
			(Putting his hand to his forehead) 
		'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing.  
		You meet a lotta interesting professors.  
		You know, it's stimulating.

EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY

Annie and Alvy, in Annie's VW, driving to their summerhouse.  The camera moves 
with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage.  There 
is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet.  Classical music plays in the 
background.

								CUT TO:

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

Annie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing 
through a school catalogue.  Alvy lies in bed reading.

				ANNIE 
			(Reading) 
		Does this sound like a good course?  
		Uh, "Modern American Poetry"?  Uh, or, 
		uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh, 
		take "Introduction to the Novel."

				ALVY 
		Just don't take any course where they 
		make you read Beowulf.

				ANNIE 
		What? 
			(Laughing) 
		Hey, listen, what-what do you think?  Do 
		you think we should, uh, go to that-that 
		party in Southampton tonight? 

Alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder.

				ALVY 
		No, don't be silly.  What-what do we need 
		other people for? 
			(He puts his arms around her neck, 
			kissing her, Annie making muffled 
			sounds) 
		You know, we should-we should just turn 
		out the lights, you know, and play hide 
		and seek or something.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Well, okay.  Well, listen, I'm gonna get 
		a cigarette, okay?

				ALVY 
			(Yelling out to her as she leaves 
			the room) 
		Yeah, grass, right?  The illusion that 
		it will make a white woman more like 
		Billie Holiday.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		Well, have you ever made love high?

				ALVY
		Me, no.  You ... I-I-you know, if I 
		have grass or alcohol or anything I 
		get unbearably wonderful.  I get too, 
		too wonderful for words.  You know, 
		I don't-I don't know why you have to, 
		uh, get high every time we make love.

				ANNIE 
			(Moving back into the room and 
			lighting a joint) 
		It relaxes me.

				ALVY 
		Oh, you-you have to be artificially 
		relaxed before we can go to bed?

				ANNIE 
			(Closing the door) 
		Well, what's the difference, anyway?

				ALVY 
		Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium 
		pentothal.  You can sleep through it.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, come on, look who's talking.  You've 
		been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. 
			(She gets into bed and takes a 
			puff of marijuana) 
		You should smoke some o' this.  You'd be 
		off the couch in no time.

				ALVY 
		Oh, come, you don't need that.

Alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her.

				ANNIE 
		What are you doing?

				ALVY 
			(Kissing her) 
		No, no, no, what ... You can once, you 
		can live without it once.  Come on.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.
			(Laughing and making sounds) 
		M'mrnm.

				ALVY 
		M'm, wait, I got a great idea. 
			(He gets up and goes over to the 
			closet, taking out a light bulb.  
			He goes back to the bed and turns 
			out the lamp on the night table) 
		Hang in there for a second.  I got a 
		little-little artifact.  A little erotic 
		artifact, that-that I brought up from the 
		city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. 
			(He turns the lamp back on, having 
			replaced the bulb with the red one 
			from the closet) 
		I just ... there ... There's a little Old 
		New Orleans ... essence.  Now-now we can go 
		about our business here and we can even 
		develop photographs if we want to.  There, 
		now there. 
			(He undresses and crawls into bed, 
			taking Annie in his arms) 
		M'mmm.  M'mmm.  Hey, is something wrong?  

				ANNIE

		Uh-uh-why?

				ALVY 
		I don't know.  You- It's like you're-
		you're removed.

				ANNIE 
		No, I'm fine.

As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits 
down on a chair, watching.

				ALVY 
		Really?

				ANNIE 
		U-huh.

				ALVY 
		I don't know, but you seem sort of distant. 

				ANNIE 
		Let's just do it, all right?

				ALVY
			(Kissing and caressing Annie) 
		Is it my imagination or are you just 
		going through the motions?

				ANNIE'S SPIRIT  
		Alvy, do you remember where I put my 
		drawing pad?  Because while you two are 
		doing that, I think I'm gonna do some 
		drawing.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		You see, that's what I call removed.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, you have my body.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, but that's not-that's no good.  
		I want the whole thing. 

				ANNIE 
			(Sighing) 
		Well, I need grass and so do you.

				ALVY 
		Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass 
			(Clearing his throat)
		 because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		-so if I get a laugh from a person who's 
		high, it doesn't count.  You know-'cause 
		they're always laughin'.

				ANNIE 
		Were you always funny?

				ALVY 
		Hey, what is this-an interview?  We're 
		supposed to be making love.

								CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE.

A typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building. 
Autographed 8 X 12 is plastered in the sloppy room.  The agent, chewing a 
cigar, sits behind his desk talking to one of his clients, a comedian, who 
stands with his hands in his pockets.  A young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair 
nearby watching.

				AGENT 
		This guy is naturally funny.  I think 
		he can write for you.

				COMIC 
			(Buttoning his jacket) 
		Yeah, yeah.  Hey, kid, he tells me you're 
		really good.  Well, lemme explain a little 
		bit o' how I work.  You know, you can tell 
		right off the bat that I don't look like 
		a funny guy when I come-you know, like some 
		o' the guys that come out.  You know, right 
		away 
			(Gesturing) 
		they're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're 
		gonna fall down, but I gotta be really 
		talented.  Material's gotta be sensational 
		for me 'cause I work, you know, with very, 
		very ... Come on, I'm kinda classy, you 
		know what I mean?  Uh ... uh ... lemme 
		explain.  For instance, I open with an 
		opening song.  A musical start like 
			(Ad-lib singing) 
		and I walk out 
			(Ad-lib singing)  
		"Place looks wonderful from here and 
		you folks look wonderful from here! 
			(Singing)
		"And seein' you there
		With a smile on your face
		Makes me shout
		This must be the place."
		Then I stop right in the middle and then 
		I open with some jokes.  Now, that's where 
		I need you, right there.  For instance, like 
		I say, "Hey, I just got back from Canada, 
		you know, they speak a lotta French up 
		there.  The only way to remember Jeanne 
		d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom!" 
			(He laughs.  Seated Alvy looks 
			up smiling) 
		"Oh, I met a big lumberjack ..."

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(To himself) 
		Jesus, this guy's pathetic. 

				COMIC 
			(Overlapping above speech) 
		... big lumberjack ...

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(To himself while the comic 
			continues his routine) 
		Look at him mincing around, like he 
		thinks he's real cute.  You wanna throw 
		up.  If only I had the nerve to do my 
		own jokes.  I don't know how much longer 
		I can keep this smile frozen on my face.  
		I'm in the wrong business, I know it.

				COMIC 
			(Overlapping above speech) 
		"'Cherie, come back.  I love you. 
			(Shaking his lips and mimicking) 
		But, uh, Cheri, what will I do with this, 
		uh?' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you 
		make me so mad."' 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, they scream at that.  Now, write me 
		somethin' like that, will yuh?  Kinda 
		French number, can yuh do it?  Huh, kid?

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering,
excited, as Alvy stands on spotlighted stage holding the microphone.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		W-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to 
		reorient myself.  This is the University 
		of Wisconsin, right?  So I'm always ... 
		I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a 
		col- I've a very bad history with colleges.  
		You know, I went to New York University and, 
		uh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman 
		year ... for cheating on my metaphysics final.  
		You know, I looked within the soul of the 
		boy sitting next to me- 
			(The audience laughs; they're with him)
		 -and when I was thrown out, my mother, 
		who's an emotionally high-strung woman, 
		locked herself in the bathroom and took an 
		overdose of mah-jongg tiles. 
			(More applause and laughter) 
		And, uh, tsch, I was depressed.  I was ... 
		in analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a 
		matter of fact, uh, I would have killed 
		myself but I was in analysis with a strict 
		Freudian and if you kill yourself ... they 
		make you pay for the sessions you miss.

INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER.

Students mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs.
Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just 
		great, I'm not kidding.  It was- You 
		were so neat.

				ALVY 
		C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know something?  
		I think that I'm starting to get more 
		of your references, too.

				ALVY
		Are yuh?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				ALVY 
		Well, the twelve o'clock show is 
		completely different than the nine.

				YOUNG WOMAN 
			(Interrupting) 
		May I have your autograph?

				ANNIE 
			(Over lapping above speech) 
		Oh.

				ALVY 
			(To Annie, while autographing) 
		You're so sure about it.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to 
		tomorrow.  I mean, you know, I think that 
		it'll be really nice to meet Mother and 
		Father. 

They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a 
flash camera as they walk through the crowd.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately. 
			(To one of his fans) 
		Thank you.

				ANNIE 
		No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think 
		they're gonna hate you at all.  On the 
		contrary, I think-

				ALVY 
		Yeah.

				ANNIE 
		It's Easter.  You know, we'll have a nice 
		dinner, we'll sit down and eat.  I think 
		they're gonna really like you.

EXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY

The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green 
lawn, then cuts to:

INT. DINING ROOM.

Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner.  The sun is pouring through a big 
picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one
end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr.
and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane.

				MOM HALL 
			(Holding her wine glass) 
		It's a nice ham this year, Mom. 

Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.

				ANNIE 
			(Smiling at Duane) 
		Oh, yeah.  Grammy always does such 
		a good job.

				DAD HALL 
			(Chewing) 
		A great sauce.

				ALVY 
		It is. 
			(Smacking his lips) 
		It's dynamite ham.

Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries 
not to notice.

				MOM HALL 
			(To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair) 
		We went over to the swap meet.  Annie, 
		Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.

				ANNIE 
		We really had a good time.

Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and
hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard.

				MOM HALL 
			(Lighting a cigarette and turning 
			to Alvy) 
		Ann tells us that you've been seeing a 
		psychiatrist for fifteen years.

				ALVY 
			(Setting down his glass and coughing) 
		Yes.  I'm making excellent progress.  
		Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, 
		I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning.  Grammy continues to 
stare.

				DAD HALL 
		Duane and I went out to the boat basin.

				DUANE 
		We were caulkin' holes all day.

				DAD HALL 
		Yeah. 
			(Laughing) 
		Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.

				MOM HALL 
		Oh, that Randolph Hunt.  You remember 
		Randy Hunt, Annie.  He was in the choir 
		with you.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yes, yes.

Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera.

				ALVY 
			(To the audience) 
		I can't believe this family. 
			(Making chewing sounds) 
		Annie's mother.  She really's beautiful.  
		And they're talkin' swap meets and boat 
		basins, and the old lady at the end of 
		the table 
			(Pointing to Grammy) 
		is a classic Jew hater.  And, uh, they, 
		they realty look American, you know, 
		very healthy and ... like they never 
		get sick or anything.  Nothing like my 
		family.  You know, the two are like oil 
		and water.

The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father,
aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table.  They eat quickly 
and interrupt one another loudly.  On the left the Halls in their dining room. 
Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed.

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Let 'im drop dead!  Who needs his 
		business?!

				ALVY'S MOTHER 
		His wife has diabetes!

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Di-diabetes?  Is that any excuse?  
		Diabetes?

				ALVY'S UNCLE 
		The man is fifty years old and doesn't 
		have a substantial job.

				ALVY'S AUNT 
			(Putting more meat on her 
			husband's plate) 
		Is that a reason to steal from his father?

				ALVY'S UNCLE 
		Whatta you talkin' about?  You don't 
		know what you're talking about.

				ALVY'S AUNT 
		Yes, I know what I'm talking about.

				ALVY'S MOTHER 
			(Interrupting) 
		George, defend him!

				ALVY'S UNCLE 
			(Over Alvy's father's muttering) 
		No Moskowitz he had a coronary.

				ALVY'S AUNT 
		You don't say.

				ALVY'S MOTHER 
		We fast.

				MOM HALL 
		Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the 
		Veterans Hospital.

				DAD HALL 
		My God, he's the new president of the 
		El Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is 
		somethin' else.

				MOM HALL 
		That's Jack's wife.  We used to make 
		that outta raisins.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yes, that's right.  Did you see 
		the new play?

				MOM HALL 
		Oh, you remember her, Annie.

				ANNIE 
		Yes, I do.

The two families start talking back and forth to one another.  The screen is 
still split.

				MOM HALL 
		How do you plan to spend the holidays, 
		Mrs. Singer?

				DAD HALL 
		Fast?

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Yeah, no food.  You know, we have to 
		atone for our sins.

				MOM HALL 
		What sins?  I don't understand.

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Tell you the truth, neither do we.

								CUT TO:

INT. DUANE'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door.

				DUANE 
		Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Walking in) 
		Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?

				DUANE 
		This is my room.

				ALVY 
			(Looking around) 
		Oh, yeah? 
			(He clears his throat) 
		Terrific.

				DUANE 
		Can I confess something?

Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser.  Duane's face is 
big lighted by a single lamp.

				DUANE 
		I tell you this because, as an artist, 
		I think you'll understand.  Sometimes 
		when I'm driving ... on the road at night
		... I see two headlights coming toward me.  
		Fast.  I have this sudden impulse to turn 
		the wheel quickly, head-on into the 
		oncoming car.  I can anticipate the 
		explosion.  The sound of shattering glass.  
		The ... flames rising out of the flowing 
		gasoline.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting and clearing his throat) 
		Right.  Tsch, well, I have to-I have 
		t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due 
		back on the planet earth. 

He slowly gets up and moves toward the door.

INT. THE HALLS' LIVING ROOM.

Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them.

				MOM HALL
		Now, don't let it be so long, now.

				ANNIE 
		No.

				DAD HALL 
		And look up Uncle Bill, you promise. 

				ANNIE 
		Okay.  Okay.

				MOM HALL 
		Oh, he's adorable, Annie.

				ANNIE 
		You think so?  Do you really?

				MOM HALL 
		We're going to take them to the airport.
				
				DAD HALL 
		Oh, no-Duane can.  I haven't finished 
		my drink. 

				ANNIE 
		Yes, Duane is.  I'll be right-

				MOM HALL 
		M'mmm.

				ANNIE 
		I just have time to get the, uh-

She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead.  It is raining very hard, the 
windshield wipers are moving quickly.  The headlights of another car brightens 
the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then 
Alvy tensely staring straight ahead.

EXT. STREET- DAY

The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones. 
It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. Annie 
walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right. They walk 
quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		You followed me.  I can't believe it!

				ALVY 
			(Off screen) 
		I didn't follow you!

				ANNIE  
		You followed me!

				ALVY   
		Why?  'Cause I ... was walkin' along 
		a block behind you staring at you?  
		That's not following!

				ANNIE 
		Well, what is your definition of 
		following?

				ALVY 
			(Gasping) 
		Following is different.  I was spying.

				ANNIE 
		Do you realize how paranoid you are?

				ALVY 
		Paranoid?  I'm looking at you.  You 
		got your arms around another guy.

				ANNIE 
		That is the worst kind of paranoia.

				ALVY 
		Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying.  
		I-I thought I'd surprise yuh.  Pick you 
		up after school.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the 
		relationship flexible, remember?  
		It's your phrase.

				ALVY 
		Oh, stop it.  But you were having an 
		affair with your college professor.  
		That jerk that teaches that incredible 
		crap course "Contemporary Crisis in 
		Western Man"!

				ANNIE 
		"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"!  
		You're really close.

				ALVY 
		What's the difference?  It's all mental 
		masturbation.

				ANNIE 
			(Stopping for a moment) 
		Oh, well, now we're finally getting to 
		a subject you know something about!

She walks away.

				ALVY 
			(Catching up to her) 
		Hey, don't knock masturbation!  It's 
		sex with someone I love.

				ANNIE 
			(Continuing to walk quickly) 
		We're not having an affair.  He's married.  
		He just happens to think I'm neat.

				ALVY 
			(Still walking next to her) 
		"Neat"!  There's that- What are you-twelve 
		years old?  That's one o' your Chippewa 
		Falls expressions!  "He thinks I'm neat."

				ANNIE 
		Who cares?  Who cares?

				ALVY
		Next thing you know he'll find you keen
		and peachy, you know?  Next thing you 
		know he's got his hand on your ass!  

They both stop in the middle of the street.

				ANNIE 
		You've always had hostility toward 
		David ever since I mentioned him!

				ALVY 
		David?  You call your teacher David?

				ANNIE 
		It's his name.

				ALVY
 			Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's 
		a biblical name.  Right?  W-What does 
		he call you?  Bathsheba?

He walks away.

				ANNIE 
			(Calling after him) 
		Alvy!  Alvy!  You're the one who never 
		wanted to make a real commitment.  You 
		don't think I'm smart enough!  We had 
		that argument just last month, or don't 
		ou remember that day?

								CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN.

Alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last 
month's argument.  Annie's voice is heard.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		I'm home!

				ALVY 
			(Turning) 
		Oh, yeah?  How'd it go?

				ANNIE 
			(Comes into the kitchen and puts 
			down a bag of groceries on the 
			kitchen table) 
		Oh, it was ... 
			(Laughing) 
		really weird.  But she's a very nice woman.

				ALVY 
		Yeah?

				ANNIE 
		And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, 
		Alvy, she had me sitting up.  So I told her 
		about-about the-the family and about my 
		feelings toward men and about my 
		relationship with my brother.

				ALVY 
		M'm.

				ANNIE 
		And then she mentioned penis envy ... 
		Did you know about that?

				ALVY 
		Me?  I'm-I'm one of the few males who 
		suffers from that, so, so ... you know.

				ANNIE 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
		G-go on, I'm interested.

				ANNIE 
		Well, she said that I was very guilty 
		about my impulses toward marriage, 
		and-and children.

				ALVY 
		M'hm.

				ANNIE 
		And then I remembered when I was a kid 
		how I accidentally saw my parents making 
		love.

				ALVY 
		Tsch.  Rea- All this happened in the 
		first hour?

				ANNIE 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
		That's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been 
		goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, 
		I don't got ... nothing like that in-

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.

				ALVY
		You cried?  I've never once cried.  
		Fantastic ...

				ANNIE
			(Taking groceries from the bag) 
		Yeah.

				ALVY
		I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.

				ANNIE
		In-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank 
		Sinatra is holding his pillow across 
		my face and I can't breathe.

				ALVY 
		Sinatra?

				ANNIE
		Yeah, and he's strangling me ...

				ALVY
		Yeah?

				ANNIE
		... and I keep, you know, it's-

				ALVY 
			(Taking a bottle of juice and 
			some celery from the bag) 
		Well, well, sure ... because he's a 
		singer and you're a singer, you know, 
		so it's perfect.  So you're trying to 
		suffocate yourself.  It-it makes perfect 
		sense.  Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic 
		... kind of insight.

				ANNIE 
			(Pointing her finger at Alvy) 
		She said, your name was Alvy Singer.

				ALVY 
			(Turning to Annie) 
		Whatta you mean?  Me?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah, yeah, yeah, you.  Because in the 
		dream ... I break Sinatra's glasses.

				ALVY 
			(Putting his band to his mouth) 
		Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra 
		had glasses.  So whatta you saying that 
		I-I'm suffocating you?

				ANNIE 
			(Turning, ajar in her hand) 
		Oh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really 
		terrible thing to him.  Because then when 
		he sang it was in this real high-pitched 
		voice.

				ALVY 
			(Thinking) 
		Tsch, what'd the doctor say?

				ANNIE 
			(Putting away some groceries)
		Well, she said that I should probably 
		come five times a week.  And you know 
		something?  I don't think I mind analysis 
		at all.  The only question is, Will it 
		change my wife?

				ALVY 
		Will it change your wife?

				ANNIE 
		Will it change my life?

				ALVY
		Yeah, but you said, "Will it change 
		my wife"!

				ANNIE
		No, I didn't. 
			(Laughing) 
		I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.

				ALVY
		You said, "Will it change. . ." Wife.  
		Will it change ...

				ANNIE
			(Yelling out, angry) 
		Life.  I said, "life."

Alvy turns toward the camera.

				ALVY 
			(To the audience) 
		She said, "Will it change my wife." You 
		heard that because you were there so I'm 
		not crazy.

				ANNIE
 			And, Alvy ... and then I told her about 
		how I didn't think you'd ever really take 
		me seriously, because you don't think that 
		I'm smart enough.

She walks out of the room.

				ALVY
 				(To Annie's back, gesturing) 
		Why do you always bring that up?  Because 
		I encourage you to take adult-education 
		courses?  I think it's a wonderful thing.  
		You meet wonderful, interesting professors'.

								CUT TO:

EXT. STREET

Annie stands at the open door of a cab, Alvy next to her gesturing as people 
and cars move by.

				ALVY 
		Adult education is such junk!  The 
		professors are so phony.  How can you 
		do it?

				ANNIE 
		A bit rapidly.  I don't care what you 
		say about David, he's a perfectly fine 
		teacher!

				ALVY 
			(Interrupting) 
		David!  David!  I can't believe this! 
 
				ANNIE 
		And what are you doing following me 
		around for, anyway?
  
				ALVY 
		I'm following you and David, if you-

				ANNIE  
			(Interrupting) 
		I just think we oughta call this 
		relationship quits! 

Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door.

ALVY
 			That's fine.  That's fine.  That's great! 
			(He turns toward the camera as the 
			cab drives away) 
		Well, I don't know what I did wrong. 
			(Gesturing) 
		I mean, I can't believe this.  Somewhere 
		she cooled off to me! 
			(He walks up to an older woman 
			walking down the street carrying 
			groceries) 
		Is it-is it something that I did?

WOMAN ON THE STREET 
		Never something you do.  That's how 
		people are. Love fades.

She moves on down the street.

ALVY
 				(Scratching his head) 
		Love fades.  God, that's a depressing
		thought. Have to ask you a question. 
			(He stops another passer-by,a man) 
		Don't go any further.  Now, with your 
		wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind 
		o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana?

				MAN ON THE STREET 
		We use a large vibrating egg.

He walks on.

				ALVY 
			(Continuing to walk) 
		Large vibrating egg.  Well, I ask a 
		psychopath, I get that kind of an answer.  
		Jesus, I-I, uh, here ... 
			(He moves up the sidewalk to 
			a young trendy-looking couple, 
			arms wrapped around each other) 
		You-you look like a really happy couple.  
		Uh, uh ... are you?

				YOUNG WOMAN
 			Yeah.

				ALVY
 			Yeah!  So ... so h-h-how do you account 
		for it?

				YOUNG WOMAN 
		Uh, I'm very shallow and empty and I 
		have no ideas and nothing interesting 
		to say.

				YOUNG MAN 
		And I'm exactly the same way.

				ALVY 
		I see.  Well, that's very interesting.  
		So you've managed to work out something, huh?

				YOUNG MAN 
		Right.

				YOUNG WOMAN
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
		Oh, well, thanks very much for talking 
		to me.

He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A 
mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if 
to speak.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		You know, even as a kid I always went 
		for the wrong women.  I think that's my 
		problem.  When my mother took me to see 
		Snow White, everyone fell in love with 
		Snow White.  I immediately fell for the 
		Wicked Queen.

The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs.  The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her 
mirror.  Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of 
him.

				WICKED QUEEN 
		We never have any fun anymore.

				CARTOON FIGURE ALVY 
		How can you say that?

				WICKED QUEEN 
		Why not?  You're always leaning on me
	 	to improve myself.

				CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
 			You're just upset.  You must be getting 
		your period.

				WICKED QUEEN
 			I don't get a period!  I'm a cartoon 
		character.  Can't I be upset once in 
		a while?

Rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked 
Queen.

				CARTOON FIGURE ROB   
		Max, will you forget about Annie?  I 
		know lots of women you can date.

				CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
 			I don't wanna go out with any other women.

				CARTOON FIGURE ROB   
		Max, have I got a girl for you.  You are
		going to love her.  She's a reporter-

The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen 
dissolves into the interior of a concert ball.  Rob's voice carries over from 
the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter.  It's very
crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his 
hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.

				CARTOON FIGURE ROB'S VOICE-OVER 
		-for Rolling Stone.

				FEMALE REPORTER
 			I think there are more people here to 
		see the Maharishi than there were to see 
		the Dylan concert.  I covered the Dylan 
		concert ... which gave me chills.  
		Especially when he sang "She takes just 
		like a woman And she makes love just 
		like a woman Yes, she does And she aches 
		just like a woman But she breaks just 
		like a little girl." 
			(They move toward the aisles as 
			a guard holds up his hands to stop 
			them) 
		Up to that I guess the most charismatic 
		event I covered was Mick's Birthday when 
    			the Stones played Madison Square Garden.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		Man, that's great.  That's just great.

				REPORTER 
		You catch Dylan?

				ALVY 
			(Coughing) 
		Me?  No, no. I-I couldn't make it that 
		ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.

				REPORTER 
		You have a raccoon?

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		Tsch, a few.

				REPORTER
 			The only word for this is trans-plendid.  
		It's trans-plendid. 

				ALVY 
		I can think of another word.

				REPORTER
 			He's God!  I mean, this man is God!  He's 
		got millions of followers who would crawl 
		all the way across the world just to touch 
		the hem of his garment.

				ALVY 
		Really?  It must be a tremendous hem.

				REPORTER 
		I'm a Rosicrucian myself.

				ALVY 
		Are you?

				REPORTER
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
		I can't get with any religion that 
		advertises in Popular Mechanics.  Look- 
			(The Maharisbi, a small, chunky 
			man, walks out of the men's room, 
			huge bodyguards flanking him while 
			policemen bold back the crowds)
		there's God coming outta the men's room.

				REPORTER
 			It's unbelievably trans-plendid!  I was 
		at the Stones concert in Altamount when 
		they killed that guy, remember?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, were yuh?  I was-I was at an Alice 
		Cooper thing where six people were rushed 
		to the hospital with bad vibes.

INT. ALVY'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

The reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand.  Alvy, lying
next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses.

				REPORTER
 				(Looking down at him) 
		I hope you don't mind that I took so long 
		to finish.

				ALVY
 				(Sighing) 
		Oh, no, no, don't be ... tsch ... don't 
		be silly.  You know, 
			(Yawning) 
		I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some 
		feeling back in my jaw now.

				REPORTER
 			Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque 
		experience.

				ALVY 
		Oh, tsch, thank you.  H'm.

				REPORTER
 			I mean that as a compliment.

				ALVY  
			(Making sounds) 
		I think-I think there's too much burden 
		placed on the orgasm, you know, to make 
		up for empty areas in life.

				REPORTER
 			Who said that?

				ALVY 
			(Rubbing his chin and shoulder) 
		Uh, oh, I don't know.  It might have 
		been Leopold and Loeb. 
			(The telephone rings.  Alvy picks 
			it up, rising up slightly from the 
			bed, concerned, as he talks) 
		Hello.  Oh, hi ... Uh, no, what-what's 
		the matter?  What-what-what?  You sound 
		terrible ... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh
		-what kind of an emergency? ... No, well, 
		stay there.  Stay there, I'll come over 
		right now.  I'll come over right now.  Just 
		stay there, I'll come right over.

He hangs up.  The reporter sits in bed still, taking in the situation.

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY

Annie, looking slightly distraught, goes to open the door to Alvy's knock.

				ALVY 
		What's- It's me, open up.

				ANNIE
 				(Opening the door) 
		Oh.

				ALVY
 			Are you okay?  What's the matter? 
			(They look at each other, Annie 
			sighing) 
		Are you all right?  What-

				ANNIE
 			There's a spider in the bathroom.

				ALVY  
			(Reacting) 
		What?

				ANNIE 
		There's a big black spider in the bathroom.

				ALVY
 			That's what you got me here for at three 
		o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a 
		spider in the bathroom?

				ANNIE
 			My God, I mean, you know how I am about 
		insects.
 
				ALVY
 				(Interrupting, sighing) 
		Oooh.

				ANNIE
		-I can't sleep with a live thing crawling 
		around in the bathroom.

				ALVY
 			Kill it!  For Go- What's wrong with you?  
		Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?

				ANNIE
 				(Shaking her head) 
		No.

Alvy, disgusted, starts waving his hands and starts to move into the living 
room.

				ALVY
 				(Sighing) 
		I told you a thousand times you should 
		always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray.  
		You never know who's gonna crawl over.

				ANNIE 
			(Following him) 
		I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and 
		a fire extinguisher.

				ALVY
		Jesus.  All right, gimme a magazine.  
		I- 'cause I'm a little tired. 
			(While Annie goes of to find 
			him a magazine, Alvy, still 
			talking, glances around the 
			apartment.  He notices a small 
			book on a cabinet and picks it up.) 
		You know, you, you joke with-about me, 
		you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for 
		anything.  An emergency, a tidal wave, 
		an earthquake.  Hey, what is this?  
		What?  Did you go to a rock concert?

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
		Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd 
		you like it?  Was it-was it, I mean, 
		did it ... was it heavy?  Did it achieve 
		total heavy-ocity?  Or was it, uh...

				ANNIE
 			It was just great!

				ALVY
 				(Thumbing through the book) 
		Oh, humdinger.  When- Well, I got a 
		wonderful idea.  Why don'tcha get the 
		guy who took you to the rock concert, 
		we'll call him and he can come over and 
		kill the spider.  You know, it's a-

He tosses the book down on the cabinet.

				ANNIE 
 			I called you; you wanna help me ... or 
		not?  H'h?  Here. 

She hands him a magazine.

				ALVY
 				(Looking down at the magazine) 
		What is this?  What are you, since 
		when do you read the "National Review"?  
		What are you turning in to?

				ANNIE
 				(Turning to a nearby chair for 
			some gum in her pocketbook) 
		Well, I like to try to get all points 
		of view.

				ALVY 
		It's wonderful.  Then why don'tcha get 
		William F. Buckley to kill the spider?

				ANNIE
 			(Spinning around to face him) 
		Alvy, you're a little hostile, you 
		know that?  Not only that, you look 
		thin and tired.

She puts a piece of gum in her mouth.

				ALVY
  			Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock 
		in the morning.  You, uh, you got me 
		outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't 
		get a taxi cab.  You said it was an 
		emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up 
		the stairs.  Hell - I was a lot more 
		attractive when the evening began.  
		Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you 
		going with a right-wing rock-and roll 
		star?  Is that possible?

				ANNIE
 				(Sitting down on a chair arm 
			and looking up at Alvy) 
		Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

				ALVY
 			Hey, what am I-your son?  Whatta you mean?
		I-I came over TV --_

				ANNIE
 				(Touching his chest with her hand) 
		I got the good chocolate, Alvy.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, where is the spider?

				ANNIE
 			It really is lovely.  It's in the bathroom.

				ALVY
 			Is he in the bathroom?

				ANNIE 
			(Rising from chair) 
		Hey, don't squish it, and after it's 
		dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? 
		And flush it a couple o' times.

				ALVY
 				(Moving down the hallway to 
			the bathroom) 
		Darling, darling, I've been killing 
		spiders since I was thirty, okay?

				ANNIE
 				(Upset, hands on her neck) 
		Oh.  What?

				ALVY 
			(Coming back into the living room) 
		Very big spider.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah?

				ALVY
 			Two ... Yeah.  Lotta, lotta trouble. 
		There's two of 'em. 

Alvy starts walking down the ball again, Annie following.

				ANNIE
 			Two?

				ALVY
  				(Opening a closet door) 
		Yep.  I didn't think it was that big, 
		but it's a major spider.  You got a 
		broom or something with a-

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I-I left it at your house.

				ALVY
 				(Overlapping) 
		-snow shovel or anything or something.

				ANNIE
 				(Overlapping) 
		I think I left it there, I'm sorry.

Reaching up into the closet, Alvy takes out a covered tennis racquet.

				ALVY
 				(Holding the racquet) 
		Okay, let me have this.

				ANNIE
 			Well, what are you doing ... what are 
		you doing with-

				ALVY
 			Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom 
		the size of a Buick.

He walks into the bathroom, Annie looking after him.

				ANNIE
 			Well, okay.  Oooh.

Alvy stands in the middle of the bathroom, tennis racquet in one band, rolled
magazine in the other.  He looks over at the shelf above the sink and picks up 
a small container.  He holds it out, shouting off screen to Annie.

				ALVY 
		Hey, what is this?  You got black soap?
  
				ANNIE
 				(Off screen) 
		It's for my complexion.

				ALVY
 			Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show?  
		Geez. 
			(Alvy turns and starts swapping 
			the racquet over the shelf, knocking 
			down articles and breaking glass) 
		Don't worry! 
			(He continues to swat the racquet 
			all over the bathroom.  He finally 
			moves out of the room, hands close 
			to his body.  He walks into the 
			other room, where Annie is sitting 
			in a corner of her bed leaning against 
			the wall) 
		I did it!  I killed them both.  What-what's 
		the matter?  Whatta you- 
			(Annie is sobbing, her band over 
			her face)
		-whatta you sad about?  You- What'd you 
		want me to do?  Capture 'em and rehabilitate 
		'em?

				ANNIE
 				(Sobbing and taking Alvy's arm) 
		Oh, don't go, okay?  Please.
	
				ALVY
 				(Sitting down next to her) 
		Whatta you mean, don't go?  Whatta-whatta
		-what's the matter?  Whatta you expecting
		-termites?  What's the matter?

				ANNIE
 				(Sobbing) 
		Oh, uh, I don't know.  I miss you.  Tsch.

She beats her fist on the bed.  Reacting, Alvy puts his arm around her shoulder
and leans back against the wall.

				ALVY
 			Oh, Jesus, really?

				ANNIE
 				(Leaning on his shoulder) 
		Oh, yeah.  Oh. 
			(They kiss) 
		Oh!  Alvy?

				ALVY 
		What?

He touches her face gently as she wipes tears from her face.

				ANNIE
 			Was there somebody in your room when 
		I called you?

				ALVY
 			W-w-whatta you mean?

				ANNIE
 			I mean was there another- I thought I 
		heard a voice.

				ALVY
		Oh, I had the radio on.

				ANNIE
		Yeah?

				ALVY
		I'm sorry.  I had the television set 
		... I had the television-

				ANNIE
		Yeah.

Alvy pulls her to him and they kiss again.

								CUT TO:

INT. ALVY'S BED

Alvy is lying in bed next to Annie, who is leaning on her elbow looking down 
at him.  He rubs her arms and she smiles.

				ANNIE
 			Alvy, let's never break up again.  I don't 
		wanna be apart.

				ALVY 
		Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too 
		mature for something like that.

				ANNIE
 			Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?

				ALVY
 			It's all right for me, it's been terrific, 
		you know?  Better than either one of my 
		marriages.  See, 'cause. . . 'cause there's 
		just something different about you.  I 
		don't know what it is, but it's great.

				ANNIE 
			(Snickering) 
		You know I think that if you let me, maybe 
		I could help you have more fun, you know?  
		I mean, I know it's hard and ... Yeah.

				ALVY 
		I don't know.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, what about ... what if we go away 
		this weekend, and we could-

				ALVY
 			Tsch, why don't we get ... why don't 
		we get Rob, and the three of us'll 
		drive into Brooklyn, you know, and 
		we show you the old neighborhood.

				ANNIE
 			Okay, okay.  Okay.

				ALVY
 			That'd be fun for yuh.  Don't you think-

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

Alvy raises up his head and they kiss.

EXT. HIGHWAY

Annie is behind the wheel in her VW, Rob is beside her, Alvy in the back seat
leaning forward so that his head is between them.  They're driving down the 
highway.

				ANNIE
 			-me, my God, it's a great day!

				ALVY 
			(Interrupting) 
		Hey, can yuh watch the road?  Watch the --
 
				ROB
 				(Overlapping) 
		Yeah, watch the road!

				ALVY 
		You'll total the whole car.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Hey, you know, I never even visited 
		Brooklyn before.

				ROB
 			I can't wait to see the old neighborhood.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.

				ROB
 			We can show her the schoolyard.

				ALVY
 			Right.  I was a great athlete.  Tell 
		her, Max, I was the best, I was all 
		schoolyard.

				ROB 
		Yes, I remember. 
			(Annie laughs) 
		He was all schoolyard.  They threw him 
		a football once, he tried to dribble it.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK.

Alvy Annie and Rob move toward the roller coaster on the screen.  The area's 
deserted.  Sea gulls are heard.

				ALVY 
		Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's
		-that's my old house.  That's where I 
		used to live.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Holy cow!

				ROB
 			You're lucky, Max-where I used to live 
		is now a pornographic equipment store.

Annie laughs.

				ALVY 
		I have some very good memories there.

				ROB
 			What kind of good memories, Max?  
		Your mother and father fighting all 
		the time.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, and always over the most 
		ridiculous things.

FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S HOUSE.

Alvy's father sits in his chair.  His mother is polishing a door while Alvy 
lies on the floor playing.  Annie, adult Alvy and Rob quietly walk into the 
scene to watch.

				ALVY'S FATHER
		You fired the cleaning woman?

				ALVY'S MOTHER
		She was stealing.

				ALVY'S FATHER
		But she's colored.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			SO?

				ALVY'S FATHER
		So the colored have enough trouble.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
		She was going through my pocketbook!

				ALVY'S FATHER
		They're persecuted enough!

				ALVY'S MOTHER
		Who's persecuting?  She stole!

Alvy's father gets up and gets his hard hat.  He sits back down and starts 
polishing it.

				ALVY'S FATHER
 			All right-so we can afford it.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			How can we afford it?  On your pay?  
		What if she steals more?

				ALVY'S FATHER
 			She's a colored woman, from Harlem!  
		She has no money!  She's got a right 
		to steal from us!  After all, who is 
		she gonna steal from if not us?

				ADULT ALVY
 				(Yelling into the scene) 
		You're both crazy!  

				ROB
 			They can't hear you, Max.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			Leo ... I married a fool!

				ROB
			(Pointing) 
		Hey, Max!  Who's that?

As the three friends watch Alvy's old living room, the scene has suddenly 
shifted.  A huge crowd stands around the room, laughing, eating, chatting and 
vibrating with the turns of the roller-coaster ride.

				ALVY
 			It-it-it's the welcome-home party 
		in nineteen forty-five, for my cousin 
		Herbie.

				ADULT ALVY
 				(Pointing) 
		Look, look, there's-there's that one 
		over there, that's Joey Nichols, he 
		was my- 
			(Young Alvy stands next to Joey 
			Nichols, who's sitting in one of 
			the easy chairs.  They smile at 
			each other; people and noise all 
			around)
		-father's friend.  He was always bothering 
		me when I was a kid.

				JOEY
 			Joey Nichols. 
			(Laughing) 
		See.  Nichols.  See, Nichols! 
			(Joey shows young Alvy his cuff 
			links and a tie pin, which are 
			made from nickels, as Alvy stands
			with hands on hips, unconcerned.  
			Joey then slaps his band to his 
			forehead and puts a nickel on 
			his forehead) 
		Yuh see, nickels!  You can always 
		remember my name, just think of Joey 
		Five Cents. 
			(Laughing) 
		That's me.  Joey Five Cents!

Joey grabs Alvy's cheeks and pinches them.

				YOUNG ALVY
 				(Turning away) 
		What an asshole!

A group of women stands near a buffet table eating and listening to Alvy 
mother and her sister, Tessie, and a young girl, as the three friends watch.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			I was always the sister with good common 
		sense.  But Tessie was always the one 
		with personality.  When she was younger, 
		they all wanted to marry Tessie.

She touches Tessie's shoulder.  Tessie starts to laugh.

				ADULT ALVY
 				(Pointing, to Rob) 
		Do you believe that, Max?  Tessie 
		Moskowitz had the personality.  She's 
		the life of the ghetto, no doubt.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 				(To the young girl) 
		She was once a great beauty.

Tessie nods her head "yes."

				ROB 
		Tessie, they say you were the sister 
		with personality.

				TESSIE
 				(Addressing the young girl) 
		I was a great beauty.

				ROB
 			Uh, how did this personality come about?

				TESSIE
 				(Grabbing the young girl's cheek) 
		I was very charming.

				ROB
 			There were many men interested in you?

				TESSIE
 				(To the young girl) 
		Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

Tessie gyrates back and forth imitating a dancer while Annie and the adult 
Alvy lean on each other laughing.

				ROB
 				(Laughing) 
		That's pretty hard to believe.

EXT. STREET.

Alvy and Annie walk contentedly down a street; Alvy's arm is draped around 
Annie.  People walk by them on the street as they move toward their apartment
building.

				ANNIE
 			Well, I had a really good day, you know 
		that?  It was just a real fine way to 
		spend my birthday.

				ALVY 
		Ah?  Oh, well, your birthday's not till 
		tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah, but it's real close.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Oh, darn it.

INT. APARTMENT

Annie and Alvy sit on the sofa.  Annie's unwrapping a gift while Alvy watches.

				ANNIE
 				(Making sounds) 
		This is-
			(Making sounds)
		Huh?

She pulls out flimsy black lingerie from the box.

				ALVY
		Happy birthday.

				ANNIE
		What is this? Is this a...Present?
			(Laughing)
		Are you kidding?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?

				ANNIE 
		Uh, yeah, uh ... t-t-this is more like 
		a present for you, yeah, but it's-

				ALVY 
		Try it ... it'll add years to our 
		sex life.

				ANNIE
 				(Looking up at Alvy and laughing) 
		Uh huh.  Yeah.  Forget it. 

Alvy leans over and hands her another box as she puts down the lingerie.

				ALVY 
		Here's a real present.

				ANNIE
 				(Opening the gift) 
		What... huh?

				ALVY  
		Check it out.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah?  What is this, anyway?
			(continuing) 
		Let me see.  Okay, let's... oooh, God! 
			(She takes out a watch from the box) 
		Oh, you knew I wanted this ... 
			(Laughing) 
		God, it's terrific, God!

				ALVY
 				(Making sounds) 
		Yeah, I know.  Just-just put on the 
		watch, and-and ... that thing, and 
		we'll just ...

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Oh!  My God! 
			(Making sounds)

Alvy kisses Annie.

INT. NIGHT CLUB.

Annie, spotlighted onstage, stands in front of the microphone, smiling.  She 
looks downward and sings "Seems Like Old Times.  " The audience applauds 
loudly as the music fades out.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Thank you.

Alvy sits at the bar, clapping and staring at Annie as she walks over to him 
and sits down.  The low murmur of the night club is surrounding them.

				ALVY
 				(Reacting) 
		You were-you were sensational.  I mean, 
		I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck 
		to it, you would be great, and-and, you 
		know, I-I-you-you were sensational.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking at Alvy, smiling) 
		Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were 
		just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, 
		it makes it really easy for me, because I 
		can be ... huh?

Tony, a famous record personality, pushes through the crowd, moving toward 
Alvy and Annie.  An entourage follows him as he makes his way to their table. 

TONY 
		Excuse me.

He shakes hands with Annie, smiling.

				ANNIE 
 			Oh.

				TONY 
		Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.

				ANNIE
 			Well, hi!

				TONY
		Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say 
		that we really enjoyed your sets.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, yeah, really, oh!

				TONY
		I though it was ... very musical, and I 
		liked it a lot.

				ANNIE
 			Oh, neat ... oh, that's very nice, 
		gosh, thanks a lot.

				TONY 
		Are you ... are you recording?  Or do- 
		Are you with any label now?

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		No, no, no, not at all.

				TONY  
 			Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about 
		that sometime, if you get a chance.

Seated Alvy looks the other way, reacting.

				ANNIE 
		Oh.  What about?

				TONY   
		... of possibly working together.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking for the first time at Alvy) 
		Well, hey, that's, that's nice.  Uh. 
		Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer.  
		Do you know Alvy?  Uh ... and ... uh ... 
		Tony Lacey.

				TONY
 			No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know 
		your work.  I'm a big fan of yours.

Tony reaches over and shakes hands with Alvy.  The nightclub crowd surrounds 
them all with their low chatter and cigarette smoke.

				ALVY 
		Thank you very much.  It's a pleasure.

				TONY
 				(Turning to introduce his entourage) 
		This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh ... Bob and 
		Petronia.

				ANNIE
 			Hi.

				ENTOURAGE 
		Hi.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Hi, hi, Bob ...

				TONY 
		Uh ... w-we're going back to the Pierre.  
		We're staying at the Pierre ... and we're 
		gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a 
		drink there, and ... if you'd like to come, 
		uh, we'd love to have you.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY
 			And we could just sit and talk ... nothing.  
		Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just 
		be very mellow.

Annie and Tony and his entourage turn to look at Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Fingers to his mouth, reacting) 
		Remember, we had that thing.

				ANNIE
 			What thing?

				ALVY
 				(Staring at Annie and clearing 
			his throat) 
		Don't you remember we-we-we discussed 
		that thing that we were-

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Thing?

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		-yes, we had, uh ...

				ANNIE 
			(Looking at Alvy, reacting) 
		Oh, the thing!  Oh, the thing ... 
			(Laughing) 
		... yeah ... yeah.

Annie turns, looks at Tony as he smiles and gestures with his hands.

				TONY 
		Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, 
		we can't do it now ... that's fine, 
		too.  W-w-w-we'll do it another time.

				ANNIE
 			Hey-

				TONY 
		Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get 
		together and ... and we'll meet there.

He shakes hands with Annie.

				ANNIE 
			(Reacting) 
		Oh.

				TONY
 			It was a wonderful set.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, gosh.

				TONY 
			(Smiling) 
		I really enjoyed it. 
			(Looking at Alvy) 
		Nice to have metcha.  Good night.

				ENTOURAGE 
		Bye-bye.

				ANNIE 
		Nice to see you ... bye.  Yeah.  Bye. 

She turns and looks at Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		What's ... you ... well, what's the 
		matter, You w-wanna go to that party?

				ANNIE 
			(Looking down at her hands, 
			then up at Alvy) 
		I don't know, I thought it might be kind 
		of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be 
		nice to meet some new people.

				ALVY
 				(Sighing) 
		I'm just not ... you know, I don't think 
		I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I 
		don't respond well to mellow, you know 
		what I mean, I-I have a tendency to ... 
		if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then 
		rot.  You know, and it's-it's not good 
		for my ... 
			(Making sounds)

				ANNIE 
		All right, all right, you don't wanna go 
		to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?

INT. MOVIE THEATER.

The screen is projecting the beginning of "The Sorrow and the Pity": a street 
filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats. 
Subtitles pop on:

"The Jewish warmongers and
Parisian plutocrats tried
to flee with their gold and jewels"

as a narrator explains in German.

								CUT TO.

Split screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the 
right. Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor.  
The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. Alvy, talking to his 
psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him.  
This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood.
The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously.

				ANNIE
 				(To her doctor) 
		That day in Brooklyn was the last day 
		I remember really having a great time.

				ALVY 
			(To his doctor) 
		Well, we never have any laughs anymore, 
		is the problem.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.

				ALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST
 			How often do you sleep together?

				ANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST 
		Do you have sex often?

				ALVY 
		Hardly ever.  Maybe three times a week.

				ANNIE 
		Constantly!  I'd say three times a week.  
		Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have 
		sex.

				ALVY 
		She would not sleep with me the other 
		night, you know, it's-

				ANNIE 
		And ... I don't know ... I mean, six months 
		ago I-I woulda done it.  I woulda done it, 
		just to please him.

				ALVY 
		I mean ... I tried everything, you know, 
		I-I-I put on soft music and my-my red light 
		bulb, and ...

				ANNIE
 			But the thing is-I mean, since our 
		discussions here, I feel I have a right 
		to my own feelings.  I think you woulda 
		been happy because ... uh, uh, I really 
		asserted myself.

				ALVY 
		The incredible thing about it is, I'm 
		paying for her analysis and she's making 
		progress and I'm getting screwed.

				ANNIE 
		I don't know, though, I feel so guilty 
		because Alvy is paying for it, so, you 
		know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go 
		to bed with him.  But if I do go to bed 
		with him, it's like I'm going against my 
		own feelings.  I don't know I-I can't win.

				ALVY 
			(Simultaneously, with Annie) 
		You know ... it's getting expensive
		...my analyst ... for her analyst.  She-
		she's making progress and I'm not making 
		any progress.  Her progress is defeating 
		my progress.

				ANNIE
			(Simultaneously, with Alvy) 
		Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I 
		should just live with a woman.

								CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT

Alvy and Annie sit close together on the sofa in some friends' apartment. 
Their friends, another couple, stand behind the sofa in the background. 
Excited, they talk almost all at once.

				WOMAN FRIEND 
		Wow, I don't believe it ... you mean to 
		tell me you guys have never snorted coke?

				ANNIE 
		Well, I always wanted to try, you know, 
		but, uh, Alvy, uh ... he's very down on it.

				ALVY 
		Hey, don't put it on me.  You kn- Wh-what 
		is it, I don't wanna put a wad of white 
		powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal 
		membranes ...

They all start talking at once.

				ANNIE 
		You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Counting on his fingers) 
		How can you say that?  I mean, 
			(Making sounds) 
		who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that 
		girl from your acting class should sleep 
		together in a threesome.

				ANNIE 
			(Reacting) 
		That's sick!

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new.  
		You know, you didn't say it couldn't be 
		sick.

Annie laughs, chatters.

				WOMAN FRIEND 
		Just come on, Alvy. 
			(All four are now sitting on the 
			sofa. The male friend starts to 
			prepare lines of cocaine; Alvy 
			and Annie look at each other, 
			reacting) 
		Do your body a favor.  Try it, come on.

				ALVY 
		Oh, yeah?

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.  Come on.  It'd be fun.

				ALVY 
			(Moving forward on the couch) 
		Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause 
		the Incas did it, you know, and-and 
		they-they-they were a million laughs.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Alvy, come on, for your own experience.  
		I mean, you wanna write, why not?

				MALE FRIEND 
		It's great stuff, Alvy.  Friend of mine 
		just brought it in from California.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, do you know something-I didn't tell 
		yuh, we're going to California next week.

				GIRL 
		Oh, really?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah ...

				ALVY  
 			... I'm thrilled.  As you know, uh ... 
		uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, 
		and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

				ANNIE 
			(Interrupting) 
		No, no, no that's not it at all.  Alvy's 
		giving an award on television.  Gee, he 
		talks like he's violating a moral issue 
		sitting here.

				GIRL 
		You're kidding?

				ALVY 
		It's so phony, and we have to leave New 
		York during Christmas week, which really 
		kills me.

				MAN 
			(Interrupting) 
		Alvy, listen, while you're in California, 
		could you possibly score some coke for me?

Annie laughs.

				ALVY 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		Sure, sure, I'll be glad to. I-I'll just 
		put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that I 
		have in my boot, you know. 
			(Alvy picks up the small open 
			gold case of cocaine base the man 
			placed on the coffee table and
			looks at it, reacting) 
		H-h-how much is this stuff?

				MAN 
		It's about two thousand dollars an ounce.

				ANNIE 
		God.

				ALVY
 			Really?  And what is the kick of it?  
		Because I never ...

He puts his finger into the drug, smells it and then sneezes.  The powder 
blows all over the room as the man, woman and Annie react silently.

CALIFORNIA. BEVERLY HILLS STREET-DAY

It's a warm, beautiful day.  Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's convertible are 
moving past the spacious houses, the palm trees.  The sunlight reflects off 
the car.  Annie, excited, is taking the whole place in.  Background voices 
sing Christmas carols.

				VOICES
			(Singing) 
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish you a Merry Christmas, 
		We wish you a Merry Christmas, 
		And a -Happy New Year.

				ROB 
			(Over the singing) 
		I've never been so relaxed as I have 
		been since I moved out here, Max.  I 
		want you to see my house.  I live 
		right next to Hugh Hefner's house, Max.  
		He lets me use the Jacuzzi.  And the 
		women, Max, they're like the women in 
		Playboy magazine, only they can move 
		their arms and legs.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		You know, I can't get over that this is 
		really Beverly Hills.

				VOICES 
			(Singing) 
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		And a Happy New Year.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, the architecture is really consistent, 
		isn't it?  French next to-

				VOICES 
			(Singing over the dialogue)
		Oh, Christmas ... tree,
		Oh, Christmas tree,
		How bright and green
		Our ...

				ALVY
		-Spanish, next to Tudor, next to Japanese.

				ANNIE 
		God, it's so clean out here.

				ALVY 
		It's that they don't throw their garbage 
		away.  They make it into television shows.

				ROB 
		Aw, come on, Max, give us a break, will 
		yuh?  It's Christmas. 

Annie starts snapping pictures of the view.

				ALVY 
		Can you believe this is Christmas here?

				VOICES 
			(Singing) 
		Oh Christmas tree,
		Oh Christmas tree ...

They pass a large house with spacious lawn.  Sitting on the lawn is a Santa 
Claus complete with sleigh and reindeer.  Voices continue to sing Christmas 
carols; Annie continues to take pictures.

				ANNIE
		You know, it was snowing-it was snowing 
		and really gray in New York yesterday.

				ROB 
		No kidding?

				ALVY 
		Right-well, Santa Claus will have 
		sunstroke.

				ROB 
		Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.

				ALVY 
		There's no economic crime, you know, 
		but there's-there's ritual, religious-
		cult murders, you know, there's wheat-
		germ killers out here.

				ROB 
		While you're out here, Max, I want you 
		to see some of my TV show.  And we're 
		invited to a big Christmas party.

They continue driving, now in a less residential area, passing a hot-dog stand.
"Tail-Pup" concession; people mill about eating hot dogs.

				VOICES 
			(Singing, louder now)
		Remember Christ our Savior
		Was born on Christmas day
		To save us all ... from Satan's power
		As we were gone astray.

They pass a theater, the marquee announcing "House of Exorcism Messiah of Evil.
Rated R.  Starts at 7:15."

INT. TV CONTROL ROOM.

Several monitors line the wall in front of an elaborate console.  Rob and Alvy,
along with Charlie, the technician, stand in the small room watching the 
screens showing Rob as a television star on a situation comedy.  They chatter, 
analyzing the footage, over the sounds of the taped television comedy.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the chatter) 
		Oh.

				ROB 
		Look, now, Charlie, give me a big 
		laugh here.

				ROB ON TV SCREEN 
		A limousine to the track breakdown?

				ROB
 				(Watching) 
		A little bigger.

TV monitors go black as the technician turns of the monitors to fix the laugh 
track.

				ALVY 
		Do you realize how immoral this all is?

				ROB
 			Max, I've got a hit series.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake 
		laughs.

Technicians turn the monitors back on, showing Rob on the screen with another 
character, Arnie.

				ARNIE 
		Oh, I'm sorry.

				ROB ON TV SCREEN 
		Arnie.

				ARNIE 
		Yeah.

				ROB 
			(Turning to the technician) 
		Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.

				ALVY 
		Look, uh ...

Loud laughter from the TV monitors.

				ROB 
			(To Alvy) 
		We do the show live in front of an 
		audience.

				ALVY 
		Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause 
		your jokes aren't funny.

				ROB 
		Yeah, well, that's why this machine 
		is dynamite.

				ROB ON TV SCREEN 
		You better lie down.  You've been in 
		the sun too long.

				ROB 
			(To the technician) 
		Yeah ... uh, now give me a like a 
		medium-size chuckle here ... and 
		then a big hand.

The sounds of laughter and applause are heard from the TV.

				ALVY
			(Removing his glasses and 
			rubbing his face) 
		Is there booing on there?

The monitors show a woman on the screen.

				WOMAN 
		We were just gonna fix you up with my 
		cousin Dolores.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the TV) 
		Oh, Max, I don't feel well.

				ROB 
		What's the matter?

				ALVY 
		I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... 
			(Coughing) 
		I feel dizzy, Max.

				ROB 
		Well, sit down.

				ALVY 
			(Sitting down) 
		Oh, Jesus.

				ROB 
		You all right?

				ALVY 
		I don't know, I mean, I-

				ROB 
			(Crouching before Alvy, looking 
			at him) 
		You wanna lie down?

				ALVY 
		No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt 
		queasy all morning.  I just started 
		getting ...

				ROB 
		How about a ginger ale?

				ALVY 
		Oh, Max ... no, I maybe I better lie 
		down.

INT. HOTEL ROOM.

Alvy lies in bed, one elbow propped up, a doctor sitting next to him looking 
concerned.  The doctor bolds out a plate of chicken; Alvy listlessly stares at 
it. Annie, in the background, is on the phone.

				ANNIE 
			(Talking into the phone) 
		Yes.

				DOCTOR 
			(Holding out the food) 
		Why don't you just try to get a little 
		of this down?  This is just plain chicken.

				ALVY
			(Taking a piece of chicken and 
			holding it) 
		Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this.  
		I'm nauseous. 
			(He gasps and makes sounds) 
		If you could-if you could just give me 
		something to get me through the next two 
		hours, you know I-I have to go out to 
		Burbank ... and give out an award on a 
		TV show.

				ANNIE 
			(On the phone, overlapping the 
			doctor and Alvy) 
		Well ... H-h huh ... Oh, good ... Yes, 
		I'll tell him.

				DOCTOR 
		Well, there's nothing wrong with you 
		actually, so far as I can tell.  I mean, 
		you have no fever, no ... no symptoms 
		of anything serious.  You haven't been 
		eating pork or shellfish.

Annie bangs up and moves over to Alvy.

				ANNIE 
			(Sitting on the edge of the bed) 
		Excuse me.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor.  
		Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show.  They 
		said everything is fine.  They found a 
		replacement, so they're going to tape 
		without you.

				ALVY
			(Making sounds) 
		I'm nauseous.
			(He sighs and gasps)
		Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the 
		TV show?

Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of 
chicken he has been holding.  The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.  Listen, Doctor, I'm worried.

				DOCTOR 
		Now, Mrs. Singer, I can't find anything --

				ALVY 
		Christ!

				ANNIE 
		Nothing at all?

				DOCTOR 
		No, I think I can get a lab man up here.

				ALVY  
			(Grabbing the rest of the chicken 
			from the plate) 
		Oh, jesus. Can I have the salt, please?

				ANNIE 
		What do you mean?  Do you think he's-

				DOCTOR 
			(Handing the salt to Alvy) 
		Yes, excuse me. 
			(To Annie) 
		Perhaps it would be even better if we 
		took him to the hospital for a day or two.

Alvy begins to eat.

				ANNIE 
		Uh-huh ... Oh, hospital?

				DOCTOR 
		Well, otherwise, there's no real way to 
		tell what's going on. 

				ALVY 
			(Making sounds, gasping) 
		This is not bad, actually.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's car pull into a long circular driveway as an 
attendant walks over to the car.  A sprawling house is seen to the right; a 
couple moves toward the front door, and the driveway is crowded with other 
parked cars.  Loud music is heard.

				ALVY 
			(Getting out of the car) 
		Hey, don't tell me we're gonna hafta 
		walk from the car to the house.  Geez, 
		my feet haven't touched pavement since 
		I reached Los Angeles.

INT. HOUSE

A Hollywood Christmas party is in session, complete with music, milling people,
circulating waiters bolding out trays of drinks.  It's all very casual. French 
doors run the entire width of one wall; they are opened to the back lawn, 
guests move from the room to outside and back in.  It is crowded; bits of 
conversation and clinking glasses can be heard.  Two men, California-tanned, 
stand by the French doors talking.

				1ST MAN 
		Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll 
		take a meeting with you if you'll take 
		a meeting with Freddy.

				2ND MAN 
		I took a meeting with Freddy.  Freddy 
		took a meeting with Charlie.  You take 
		a meeting with him.

				1ST MAN 
		All the good meetings are taken.

								CUT TO:

FULL GROUP SHOT

A man stands talking, people in groups behind him.  Two born like gadgets are 
attached to his shoulders; he's wearing a bizarre space costume.

				3RD MAN 
		Right now it's only a notion, but I 
		think I can get money to make it into 
		a concept ... and later turn it into 
		an idea.

								CUT TO:

Alvy and Rob stand near the French doors leading to the back lawn, eating and 
drinking and watching the people walking in and out of the house.

				ROB 
		You like this house, Max?

				ALVY 
		M'hm.

				ROB 
		I even brought a road map to get us to 
		the bathroom.

				ALVY 
		Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony 
		Lacey's party.

				ROB 
		What difference does that make?

Alvy looks into the room, where Annie and Tony Lacey are having an animated 
conversation.

ALVY 
		I think he has a little thing for Annie.

				ROB 
		Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max.  He 
		goes with that girl over there.

				ALVY 
		Where?

Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a 
group of people close-by.

				ROB 
		The one with the V.P.L.

				ALVY 
		V.P.L.?

				ROB 
		Visible panty line.  Max, she is gorgeous.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great 
		for you because you're -you're used to 
		twos, aren't you?

				ROB 
		There are no twos, Max.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, you're used to the kind with the-
		with the shopping bags walking through 
		Central Park with the surgical masks 
		on muttering.

				ROB 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
		And ... uh-

				ROB 
			(Interrupting) 
		How do you like this couple, Max?

A couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy.  The man's arm is around the woman; 
they stand very close.  In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking.

				ROB 
		And I think they just came back from 
		Masters and Johnson.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, intensive care ward. 
			(Watching the woman in white) 
		My God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I 
		think she's giving me the eye. 

As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward 
them.

				ROB 
		If she comes over here, Max, my brain 
		is going to turn into guacamole.

				ALVY
 			I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  Hi.

				GIRL IN WHITE  
		You're Alvy Singer, right?  Didn't 
		we meet at EST?

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		EST?  No, no, I was never to est.

				GIRL IN WHITE 
		Then how can you criticize it?

				ALVY 
		Oh.

				ROB 
		Oh, he-he didn't say anything.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		No, no, I came out here to get some 
		shock therapy, but there was an energy 
		crisis, so I ... He's my-my food taster.  
		Have you two met?

				ROB
			(Shaking his head) 
		Hi.  How do you do.

				GIRL IN WHITE 
		Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, he's crazy.

The girl in white laughs.

				ALVY 
 				(Looking at Rob and the girl) 
		Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must 
		be in the stars.

				ROB 
		Yeah.  Right.

				ALVY 
		Uri Geller must be on the premises 
		someplace.

				ROB 
		We're gonna operate together.

Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie 
standing by the buffet table.

				TONY 
		We just need about six weeks, in about 
		six weeks we could cut a whole album.

				ANNIE
		I don't know, this is strange to me, 
		you know.

				TONY
		just ... that's all you need.  You can 
		come and stay here.

				ANNIE
		Oh.

				TONY 
		There's a whole wing in this house.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh yeah, stay here?  U-huh.

				TONY 
		You can have it to use.  Why-why are 
		you smiling?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I don't know.  I don't know.

She picks up an hors doeuvre.

								CUT TO:

The two men still talking about meetings surrounded by other groups of people 
milling about.

				1ST MAN 
		Not only is he a great agent, but he 
		really gives good meetings.

				2ND MAN   
		M'mm.

Tony, band in band with the girl in white, is leaving the party room with Alvy 
and Annie to show them the rest of the house.

				TONY 
		This is a great house, really.  Everything.  
		Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.  
		You know who the original owners were?  
		Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.  Then 
		you know who lived here?

				ALVY 
		Trigger.

Annie and the girl in white laugh.

				TONY 
		Charlie Chaplin.

				ALVY 
		Hey.

				TONY 
		Right before his un-American thing.

They stop in a den-like screening room.  A man is slouched back on one of the 
comfortable sofas that fill the room.  It is much quieter in here; a contrast 
to the noise and crowd downstairs.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, this place is great.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY 
		Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still 
		New Yorkers.

				ALVY  
		Yeah, I love it there.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah.

				TONY 
		Well, I used to live there.  I used to 
		live there for years.  You know, but 
		it's gotten-it's so dirty now.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				ALVY 
		I'm into garbage.  It's my thing.

				ANNIE 
		Boy, this is really a nice screening 
		room.  It's really a nice room.

				TONY 
		Oh, and there's another thing about New 
		York.  See ... you-you wanna see a movie, 
		you have to stand in a long line.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY
 			It could be freezing, it could be raining.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY
		And here, you just-

				GIRL IN WHITE 
		We saw "Grand Illusion" here last night.

				ALVY AND ANNIE 
			(In unison) 
		Oh, yeah?

				MAN ON THE SOFA 
			(Looking over his shoulder at 
			the group) 
		That's a great film if you're high. 
			(The group laughs, looking down 
			at the man on the sofa. He looks 
			up at them, smiling, a joint in 
			his hand, and offers them a cigarette) 
		Hey, you.

				TONY 
			(Shaking his head no) 
		Come and see our bedroom.  We did a 
		fantastic lighting job.  Okay?

				ANNIE
 			Oh, good.  Okay.

				ALVY 
		I'm cool.

Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following.

				ANNIE 
			(Taking Alvy's arm) 
		It's wonderful. I mean, you know they 
		just watch movies all day.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, and gradually you get old and die.  
		You know it's important to make a little 
		effort once in a while.

				ANNIE 
		Don't you think his girl friend's 
		beautiful?

				ALVY 
		Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A 
		pat on the androgynous side.  But it's...

They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway.

				MAN ON THE PHONE 
		Yeah, yeah.  I forgot my mantra.

As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear.  People are looser 
now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate 
corners, some couples are dancing.  Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the 
huge Christmas tree.  A tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves. 
He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of 
the room dancing.

The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then:

								CUT TO:

AIRPLANE.  INT. AIRPLANE

Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers. Annie
stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads.  Both are preoccupied, 
thinking their own thoughts.

				ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
			(To herself) 
		That was fun.  I don't think California 
		is bad at all.  It's a drag coming home.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
			(To himself) 
		Lotta beautiful women.  It was fun 
		to flirt.

				ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
			(As she sips coffee) 
		I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, 
		but our relationship doesn't seem to 
		work anymore.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
			(An open magazine lies in 
			his lap) 
		I'll have the usual trouble with Annie 
		in bed tonight.  Whatta I need this?

				ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
		If only I had the nerve to break up, 
		but it would really hurt him.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		If only I didn't feel guilty asking 
		Annie to move out.  It'd probably 
		wreck her.  But I should be honest.

He looks over at Annie.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking back at Alvy) 
		Alvy, uh, let's face it.  You know 
		something, don't think our relationship 
		is working.

				ALVY 
		Tsch, I know.  A relationship, I think, 
		is-is like a shark, you know?  It has 
		to constantly move forward or it dies. 
			(He sighs) 
		And I think what we got on our hands 
			(Clearing his throat) 
		is a dead shark.

INT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY

A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general 
disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie 
move out.

				ALVY 
			(Holding up a book) 
		Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?

				ANNIE 
			(Walking into the room with an 
			armload of books) 
		Well, let's see now ... If it has my 
		name on it, then I guess it's mine.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote 
		your name in all my books, 'cause you 
		knew this day was gonna come.

				ANNIE 
			(Putting down the books and 
			flipping back her hair) 
		Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up 
		just as much as I do.

				ALVY 
			(Riffling through the books) 
		There's no-no question in my mind.  I 
		think we're doing the mature thing, 
		without any doubt.

				ANNIE 
			(Holding a framed picture and 
			moving about) 
		Now, look, all the books on death and 
		dying are yours and all the poetry books 
		are mine.

				ALVY 
			(Looking down at a book) 
		This "Denial of Death".  You remember this?

				ANNIE 
		Oh-

				ALVY 
		This is the first book that I got you.

Annie goes over to Alvy.  They both look down at the book; the fireplace, 
burning nicely, is behind them.

				ANNIE 
		-God.

				ALVY 
		Remember that day?

				ANNIE 
		Right.  Geez, I feel like there's a 
		great weight off my back.  M'mmm.

				ALVY 
		Thanks, honey.

				ANNIE 
			(Patting Alvy's shoulder) 
		Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, you 
		know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's 
		really important for us to explore new 
		relationships and stuff like that.

She walks away.

				ALVY 
		There's no-there's no question about 
		that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, 
		uh, I think a more than fair shot, 
		you know?

He tosses the book into the carton.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is 
		keen for me.

				ALVY 
			(Off screen)  
		Yeah, and I-I tru-  you know, I trust 
		her, because my-my analyst recommended 
		her.

				ANNIE 
			(Walking in with another 
			armload of books) 
		Well, why should I put you through all 
		my moods and hang-ups anyway?

				ALVY 
		Right.  And you-and you know what the 
		beauty part is?

				ANNIE 
		What?

				ALVY 
			(Holding a small box of buttons) 
		We can always come back together again.  
		Because there's no-there's no problem.  
		'Cause ... Right.

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Exactly, but ... exactly.  Ooooh!

				ALVY 
		You know, I-I-I don't think many couples 
		could handle this.  You know, they could 
		just break up and remain friends.

				ANNIE 
			(Taking a button from a box) 
		Hey, this one's mine, this button.
		This one, you rem-

				ALVY 
			(Interrupting) 
		Yeah.

				ANNIE 
		I guess these are all yours.  Impeach, uh, 
		Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach 
		Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET-DAY

People milling about on the sidewalk as Alvy walks out of a store and moves 
toward the foreground.

				ALVY 
			(Into the camera, to the audience) 
		I miss Annie.  I made a terrible 
		mistake.

A couple, walking down the street, stops as the man talks to Alvy.

				MAN ON THE STREET 
		She's living in Los Angeles with 
		Tony Lacey.

				ALVY 
		Oh, yeah?  Well, if she is, then the 
		hell with her!  If she likes that 
		lifestyle, let her live there!  He's 
		a jerk, for one thing.

				MAN ON THE STREET 
		He graduated Harvard.

				ALVY
 			Yeah. He may- Listen, Harvard makes 
		mistakes too, you know.  Kissinger 
		taught there.  

The couple strolls away as an older woman walks up to Alvy while others walk by.

				OLD WOMAN 
		Don't tell me you're jealous?

				ALVY 
		Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. 
		Lemme, lemme-can I show you something, 
		lady? 
			(He takes a small item from his 
			pocket to show the woman) 
		What I have here ... I found this in the 
		apartment.  Black soap.  She used to wash 
		her face eight hundred times a day with 
		black soap. Don't ask me why.

				OLD WOMAN 
		Well, why don't you go out with other 
		women?

				ALVY 
		Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know, 
		it's very depressing.

RECENT FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S COUNTRY KITCHEN

Alvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor 
bolding up a live lobster.  He puts it on a grill tray.

				ALVY 
			(Pointing to the lobster) 
		This always happens to me.  Quick, g-go 
		get a broom. 

His date, a girl wearing short shorts, leans against the sink and lights a 
cigarette.  She makes no move to help.

				GIRL DATE 
			(Smoking) 
		What are you making such a big deal about? 
			(As she talks, the lobster drops 
			from the tray to the floor.  Alvy 
			jumps away, then gingerly scrapes 
			the tray toward the lobster) 
		They're only lobsters.  Look, you're a 
		grown man, you know how to pick up a 
		lobster.

				ALVY 
			(Looking up in stooped-over 
			position) 
		I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.

				GIRL DATE 
			(Still leaning against the sink, 
			her hand on her hip) 
		Oh, when'd you quit smoking? 

He gets up of the floor with the lobster on the tray.

				ALVY 
		Sixteen years ago.

				GIRL DATE 
			(Puzzled) 
		Whatta you mean?  

				ALVY 
			(Mocking) 
		Mean?

				GIRL DATE 
		You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, 
		is that what you said?  Oh, I-I don't 
		understand.  Are you joking, or what?

								CUT TO:

A solitary Alvy walking along the FDR Drive where he had walked with Annie. - 
The New York skyline is still in the background, the sea gulls go by, the fog 
horn blows.  He walks slowly, moving off screen.

INT. ALVY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Alvy sits on his bed talking on the phone.

				ALVY 
		Listen, honey, Central Park's turning 
		green ... Yeah, I sa-I saw that lunatic 
		that we-where we used to see ... with 
		the, uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, 
		and the roller skates? . . . Listen, 
		I-I want you to come back here ... Well, 
		I-I-then I'm gonna come out there and 
		getcha.

								CUT TO:

An airborne plane.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT.

People milling about as Alvy, in the outside phone-booth center, talks.

				ALVY 
		Whatta you mean, where am I? Where do-
		where do you think I am?  I'm-I'm out 
		... I'm at the Los Angeles Airport.  
		I flew in ... 
			(Sniffling) 
		Tsch, I-well, I flew in to see you ... 
			(Muttering) 
		Hey, listen, can we not debate this 
		on-on the telephone because I'm, you 
		know, I-I feel that I got a temperature 
		and I'm-I'm getting my-my chronic Los 
		Angeles nausea. I-I don't feel so good.

Alvy's conversation is still heard as the screen shows him behind the wheel of 
a car on a busy street; he causes a near-accident by jerking the car too slowly
toward an intersection.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I 
		don't care.  I'll-I'll drive in.  I 
		rented a car I'm driving ... that ... 
		Whatta you mean?  What-why is that such 
		a miracle?  I'm driving myself --

EXT. OUTDOOR CAF - DAY

People sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a Sunset 
Boulevard outdoor cafe.  Street traffic goes by while they dine.  There's a 
mild California breeze.  The restaurant is somewhat crowded as Alvy makes his 
way around the tables looking about.  He finally sits down at an empty table; 
nearby sits a woman with a younger man.  A waitress brings Alvy a menu and 
waits for his order.

				ALVY
			(To the waitress) 
		I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa 
		sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.

Annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view.  Alvy,
noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table.  He rises and they shake 
hands.

				ANNIE 
		Hi.

Alvy wipes at his nose as he stares.  He smiles, the street traffic moving 
behind him. Annie smiles back.

				ALVY 
		You look very pretty.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, 
		that's all. 
			(Alvy adjusts his glasses, not 
			exactly knowing where to start; 	
			a bit uneasy) 
		Well, you look nice.

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head) 
		You see, I-I've been thinking about it 
		and I think that we should get married.

				ANNIE 
			(Adjusting her sunglasses) 
		Oh, Alvy, come on.

				ALVY 
		Why?  You wanna live out here all year?  
		It's like living in Munchkin Land.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking around) 
		Well, whatta you mean?  I mean, it's 
		perfectly fine out here.  I mean, Tony's 
		very nice and, uh, well, I meet people 
		and I go to parties and-and we play tennis.  
		I mean, that's ... that's a very big step 
		for me, you know?  I mean ... 
			(Reacting, Alvy looks down at 
			his hands, then up) 
		I'm able to enjoy people more.

				ALVY 
			(Sadly) 
		So whatta you ... You're not gonna come 
		back to New York?

				ANNIE 
			(Smiling) 
		What's so great about New York?  I mean, 
		it's a dying city.  You read "Death in 
		Venice."

				ALVY 
		Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice"
		till I bought it for yuh.

				ANNIE 
		That's right, that's right. 
			(Still smiling) 
		You only gave me books with the word 
		"death" in the titles.

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head and gesturing) 
		That's right, 'cause it's an important 
		issue.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, 
		you know that?  I mean, your life is New 
		York City.  You're just this person.  
		You're like this island unto yourself.

				ALVY 
			(Toying with his car keys) 
		I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless 
		everybody is.  I-you know, if one guy is 
		starving someplace, that's ... you know, 
		I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening. 
			(Looking down at his hands, sadly) 
		So wanna get married or what?

				ANNIE 
			(Seriously) 
		No. We're friends.  I wanna remain friends.

				ALVY 
			(In disbelief) 
		Okay. 
			(Louder, to the waitress) 
		Check, please.  Can I -can I ... 
		Can I ... Can I ...

				ANNIE 
			(Interrupting) 
		You're mad, aren't you?

				ALVY 
			(Shaking his head) 
		No. 
			(Then nodding) 
		Yes, of course I'm mad, because you 
		love me, I know that.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, I can't say that that's true at 
		this point in my life.  I really just 
		can't say that that's true.  I mean, 
		you know how wonderful you are.  I 
		mean, you know ... you're the reason 
		that I got outta my room and that I 
		was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, 
		get more in touch with my feelings and 
		all that crap.  Anyway, look, I don't 
		wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh 
			(Laughing) 
		h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?

				ALVY
			(Shrugging his shoulders) 
		The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. 
		I'm workin' on a play. 
			(Sighing) 
		Jesus.  So whatta yuh saying?  That 
		you're not comin' back to New York with
		me?

He nods his head in disbelief.

				ANNIE 
			(Nodding) 
		No! 
			(Pauses) 
		Look, I gotta go.

She starts to rise.

				ALVY 
		You mean that ... 
			(He gets up and starts following 
			her past diners at other tables) 
		I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to 
		see you.

				ANNIE 
		I'm late.

				ALVY 
		Air miles, you know.  I mean, you 
		know what that does to my stomach?

They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.

				ANNIE 
		If you must know, it's a hectic time 
		for Tony.  The Grammys are tonight.

				ALVY 
		The what?

				ANNIE 
		The Grammys.  He's got a lotta records 
		up for awards.

				ALVY 
		You mean they give awards for that 
		kind o' music?

				ANNIE
 			Oh!

				ALVY 
		I thought just earplugs.

Annie gets into her car.  Alvy moves over to his rented convertible.

				ANNIE 
		Just forget it, Alvy, okay?  Let's 
		just forget the conversation.

She closes the door, starts the motor.

				ALVY
			(Yelling after her) 
		Awards! They do nothing but give out 
		awards!  I can't believe it.  Greatest, 
		greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!  

Annie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the 
car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with
a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has 
just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a 
flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park.  Alvy's father
is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping 
others right and left.  Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible,
purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper-
car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a 
small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking 
lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force.

Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the 
track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father 
directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy 
reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car.

He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens 
start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop 
gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him.

				ALVY 
			(Getting out of the car) 
		Officer, I know what you're gonna say.  
		I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, 
		I-I have some problems with-with-with-

				OFFICER 
			(Interrupting) 
		May I see your license, please?

				ALVY 
		Sure. 
			(Searching, he finally fishes 
			his license out of his pocket) 
		just don't-don't get angry, you know 
		what I mean?  'Cause I-I have - I have 
		my-my license here.  You know, it's a 
		rented car.  And I've ...

He drops the license and it falls to the ground.

				OFFICER
 			Don't give me your life story 
			(Looking at the piece of paper 
			on the ground)
		-just pick up the license.

				ALVY 
		Pick up the license.  You have to ask 
		nicely 'cause I've had an extremely 
		rough day.  You know, my girl friend-

				OFFICER 
			(Interrupting) 
		Just give me the license, please.

				ALVY 
		Since you put it that way. 
			(He laughs) 
		It's hard for me to refuse. 
			(He leans over, picks up the 
			license, then proceeds to rip 
			it up.  He lets the pieces go; 
			they float to the ground)
		... have a, I have a terrific problem 
		with authority, you know.  I'm... it's 
		not your fault.  Don't take it personal.

								CUT TO:

INT. JAIL-CELLS CORRIDOR.

A guard moves down the ball to the cell where, Alvy stands with other inmates.
He unlocks the door and opens it, letting Alvy out.

				ALVY 
		So long, fellas.  Keep in touch. 

He walks down the corridor off screen.

EXT. A STREET IN FRONT OF THE COURT HOUSE - DAY

Policemen are walking up and down the courthouse steps as Alvy and Rob move 
out the door of the building, down the steps to the street.

				ROB 
		Imagine my surprise when I got your 
		call, Max.

				ALVY 
			(Carrying his jacket over his 
			shoulder) 
		Yeah.  I had the feeling that I got 
		you at a bad moment.  You know, I heard 
		high-pitched squealing.

They walk over to Rob's convertible and get in.

				ROB 
			(Starting the car) 
		Twins, Max.  Sixteen-year-olds.  Can you 
		imagine the mathematical possibilities?

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		You're an actor, Max.  You should be 
		doing Shakespeare in the Park.

				ROB 
		Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.  
		I got mugged.  I was playing Richard the 
		Second and two guys with leather jackets 
		stole my leotard.

He puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles.

				ALVY 
			(Looking at Rob's helmet) 
		Max, are we driving through plutonium?

				ROB 
		Keeps out the alpha rays, Max.  You

INT. REHEARSAL HALL OF A THEATER.

An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball.  
They face each other.  The actress resembles Annie; the actor, Alvy.

				ACTOR 
		You're a thinking person.  How can you 
		choose this lifestyle?

				ACTRESS 
		What is so incredibly great about New 
		York?  It's a dying city!  You-you read 
		"Death in Venice".

				ACTOR 
		You didn't read "Death in Venice" till 
		I gave it to you!

				ACTRESS 
		Well, you only give me books with the 
		word "death" in the title.

The camera pulls back, showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up 
near the actors.  A mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the 
two actors, a script lying on the table between them.  It is obvious now that 
they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote.

				ACTOR 
			(In mirrored reflection) 
		It's an important issue.

				ACTRESS 
			(In mirrored reflection) 
		Alvy, you are totally incapable of 
		enjoying life.

The camera moves back to actual actor and actress.

				ACTRESS 
		You're like New York.  You're an island.

				ACTOR 
			(Rising with emotion) 
		Okay, if that's all that we've been 
		through together means to you, I guess 
		it's better if we just said goodbye, 
		once and for all!  You know, it's funny, 
		after all the serious talks and passionate 
		moments that it ends here ... in a health
		-food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.  
		Goodbye, Sunny.

The actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair.

				ACTRESS 
		Wait!  I'm-I'm gonna ... go with you. 
			(The actor comes back. They embrace) 
		I love you.

The camera cuts to Alvy, who turns and looks straight into the camera.

				ALVY 
			(To the audience, gesturing) 
		Tsch, whatta you want?  It was my first 
		play.  You know, you know how you're 
		always tryin' t' get things to come out 
		perfect in art because, uh, it's real 
		difficult in life.  Interestingly, however, 
		I did run into Annie again.  It was on the 
		Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Annie, singing "Seems Like Old Times, " overlaps Alvy's speech and continues 
over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater, 
shakes hands with Annie and her escort.  The theater marquee reads "OPHULS 
PRIZE FILM: 'THE SORROW AND THE PITY'."

				ALVY'S VOICE
			(Over the theater scene and, 
			Annie's singing) 
		She had moved back to New York.  She was 
		living in SoHo with some guy. 
			(Laughing) 
		And when I met her she was, of all things, 
		dragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the 
		Pity."  Which I counted as a personal 
		triumph.  Annie and I ... 
			(Alvy's voice continues over the 
			scene shot through a window of 
			Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and 
			Annie sitting at a table, laughing 
			and enjoying themselves) 
		... we had lunch sometime after that, and, 
		uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.

A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to 
sing:

Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie 
driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich.

Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to 
Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove.

Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.

Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and 
sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home 
in her car.

Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie
and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the "Death" titles; Annie and, Alvy in 
their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts 
in the red light.

The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's 
house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing 
tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college 
performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came 
over to kill the spider.

And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy 
following, the day she first moved into his apartment.  Annie holding up her 
sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and 
Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park
bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City 
skyline behind them.
The music stops.

Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows 
Annie and Alvy across street.  They look about at the city traffic.  Lunch is 
over; it's time.

Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like.  Annie crosses 
the street, Alvy watching her go.  Then he turns, and slowly walks down the 
street off screen.  His voice is heard over the scene:

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		After that it got pretty late.  And we 
		both hadda go, but it was great seeing 
		Annie again, right?  I realized what a 
		terrific person she was and-and how much 
		fun it was just knowing her and I-I 
		thought of that old joke, you know, this-
		this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and 
		says, "Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He 
		thinks he's a chicken." And, uh, the 
		doctor says, "Well, why don't you turn 
		him in?" And the guy says, "I would, but 
		I need the eggs." Well, I guess that's 
		pretty much how how I feet about 
		relationships.  You know, they're totally 
		irrational and crazy and absurd and ... 
		but, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it 
		because, uh, most of us need the eggs.

FADE IN:

Abrupt medium close-up of Alvy Singer doing a comedy monologue.  He
wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark.

				ALVY         
		There's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly 
		women are at a Catskills mountain 
		resort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the 
		food at this place is really terrible." 
		The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and 
		such ... small portions." Well, that's 
		essentially how I feel about life.  Full 
		of loneliness and misery and suffering 
		and unhappiness, and it's all over much 
		too quickly.  The-the other important 
		joke for me is one that's, uh, usually 
		attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think 
		it appears originally in Freud's wit and 
		its relation to the unconscious.  And it 
		goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... 
		"I would never wanna belong to any club 
		that would have someone like me for a 
		member." That's the key joke of my adult 
		life in terms of my relationships with 
		women.  Tsch, you know, lately the 
		strangest things have been going 
		through my mind, 'cause I turned forty, 
		tsch, and I guess I'm going through a 
		life crisis or something, I don't know. 
		I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.  
		I'm not one o' those characters, you know. 
		Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's 
		about the worst you can say about me.  I, 
		uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get 
		older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the-
		the balding virile type, you know, as 
		opposed to say the, uh, distinguished 
		gray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm 
		neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' 
		those guys with saliva dribbling out of 
		his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria 
		with a shopping bag screaming about 
		socialism. 
			(Sighing) 
		Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't 
		get my mind around that.  You know, I-I 
		keep sifting the pieces of the relationship 
		through my mind and-and examining my life 
		and tryin' to figure out where did the 
		screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we 
		were... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and 
		... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a 
		morose type.  I'm not a depressive character.  
		I-I-I, uh, 
			(Laughing) 
		you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, 
		I guess.  I was brought up in Brooklyn 
		during World War II.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE-DAY

Alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his  mother in an old-fashioned, 
cluttered doctor's office.  The doctor stands near the sofa, holding a 
cigarette and listening.

				MOTHER 
			(To the doctor) 
		He's been depressed.  All off a sudden, 
		he can't do anything.

				DOCTOR 
			(Nodding) 
		Why are you depressed, Alvy?
 
				MOTHER 
			(Nudging Alvy) 
		Tell Dr. Flicker. 
			(Young Alvy sits, his head down.  His 
			mother answers for him) 
		It's something he read.

				DOCTOR 
			(Puffing on his cigarette and 
			nodding) 
		Something he read, huh?  

				ALVY 
			(His head still down) 
		The universe is expanding.

				DOCTOR 
		The universe is expanding?

				ALVY 
			(Looking up at the doctor) 
		Well, the universe is everything, and if 
		it's expanding, someday it will break apart 
		and that would be the end of everything!

Disgusted, his mother looks at him.

				MOTHER 
			(shouting) 
		What is that your business? 
			(she turns back to the doctor) 
		He stopped doing his homework.

				ALVY 
		What's the point?

				MOTHER 
			(Excited, gesturing with her hands) 
		What has the universe got to do with it?  
		You're here in Brooklyn!  Brooklyn is not 
		expanding!

				DOCTOR 
			(Heartily, looking down at Alvy) 
		It won't be expanding for billions of years 
		yet, Alvy.  And we've gotta try to enjoy 
		ourselves while we're here.  Uh?

He laughs.

Fall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it. 
A line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window 
of the house a band shakes a dust mop.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood 
		memories, but I swear I was brought up 
		underneath the roller-

								CUT TO:

INT. HOUSE

Alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while 
his father sits on the sofa reading the paper.  The house shakes with every 
move of the roller coaster.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		-coaster in the Coney Island section of 
		Brooklyn.  Maybe that accounts for my 
		personality, which is a little nervous, I 
		think.

CUT TO:

Young Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men 
representing the Army, the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman 
in a skirted bathing suit.  They all turn and run toward the foreground.  The 
girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss.  The sign over the 
concession reads "Steve's Famous Clam Bar.  Ice Cold Beer, "and the roller 
coaster is moving in full gear in the background.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		You know, I have a hyperactive imagination.  
		My mind tends to jump around a little, and 
		have some trouble between fantasy and reality.

								CUT TO:

Full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other 
as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		My father ran the bumper-car concession. 
			(Alvy as a child moves into the frame 
			driving a bumper car.  He stops as other 
			cars bombard him.  His father continues 
			to direct the traffic) 
		There-there he is and there I am.  But I-I-I-I 
		used to get my aggression out through those 
		cars all the time.

Alvy backs up his car off screen.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY

The camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the 
blackboard.  The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures. 
While Alvy speaks, one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard.
- "2 X 10 = 20 " and other arithmetic formulas.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		I remember the staff at our public 
		school.  You know, we had a saying, uh, 
		that "Those who can't do, teach, and 
		those who can't teach, teach gym." And 
		...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't 
		do anything, I think, were assigned to 
		our school.  I must say-

								CUT TO:

A female teacher standing in front of an old-fashioned schoolroom.  The 
blackboard behind her reads "Transportation Administration. The camera pans 
her point of view: a group of young students sitting behind their desks.  Alvy 
as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student activity;
there is note-passing, ruler-tapping, nose-picking, gumchewing.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		I always felt my schoolmates were idiots.  
		Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little 
		face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss 
		Perfect all the time.  And-and Ivan 
		Ackerman, always the wrong answer.  Always. 

Ivan stands up behind his desk.

				IVAN 
		Seven and three is nine.

Alvy hits his forehead with his hand.  Another student glances over at him, 
reacting.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Even then I knew they were just jerks. 
			(The camera moves back to the teacher, 
			who is glaring out at her students) 
		In nineteen forty-two I had already dis-

As Alvy talks, the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl.  
She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to 
his seat.

				1ST GIRL 
			(Making noises) 
		Ugh, he kissed me, he kissed me.

				TEACHER 
			(Off screen) 
		That's the second time this month!  Step 
		up here!

As the teacher, really glaring now, speaks, Alvy rises from his seat and moves 
over to her.  Angry, she points with her band while the students turn their 
heads to watch what will happen next.

				ALVY 
		What'd I do?

				TEACHER 
		Step up here!

				ALVY 
		What'd I do?

				TEACHER 
		You should be ashamed of yourself.

The students, their heads still turned, look back at Alvy, now an adult, 
sitting in the last seat of the second row.

				ALVY (AS ADULT) 
			(First off screen, then onscreen as 
			camera moves over to the back of the 
			classroom) 
		Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual 
		curiosity.

				TEACHER 
			(The younger, Alvy standing next to her) 
		Six-year-old boys don't have girls on 
		their minds.

				ALVY (AS ADULT) 
			(Still sitting in the back of 
			the classroom) 
		I did. 

The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and 
speaks.

				1ST GIRL 
		For God's sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks 
		of a latency period.

				ALVY (AS ADULT) 
			(Gesturing) 
		Well, I never had a latency period.  I 
		can't help it.

				TEACHER
			(With young, Alvy still at her side) 
		Why couldn't you have been more like Donald? 
			(The camera pans over to Donald, 
			sitting up tall in his seat, then 
			back to the teacher) 
		Now, there was a model boy!

				ALVY (AS CHILD) 
			(Still standing next to the teacher) 
		Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.

				DONALD 
		I run a profitable dress company.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Right.  Sometimes I wonder where my 
		classmates are today.

The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, 
the teacher standing in the front of the room.  One at a time, the young 
students rise u from their desks and speak.

				1ST BOY 
		I'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

				2ND BOY 
		I sell tallises.

				3RD BOY 
		I used to be a heroin addict.  Now I'm a 
		methadone addict. 

				2ND GIRL 
			I'm into leather.

INT. ROOM

Close-up of a TV screen showing Alvy as an adult on a talk show.  He sits next 
to the show, host, Dick Cavett, a Navy man sits on his right.  Static is heard 
throughout the dialogue.

				ALVY 
		I lost track of most of my old schoolmates, 
		but I wound up a comedian.  They did not take 
		me in the Army.  I was, uh ... Interestingly 
		enough, I was-I was four-P.

Sounds of TV audience laughter and applause are heard.

				DICK CAVETT 
		Four-P?

				ALVY 
		Yes.  In-in-in-in the event of war, I'm a 
		hostage.

More audience laughter joined by Dick Cavett and the naval officer.

INT. THE HOUSE WHERE ALVY GREW UP

Alvy's  mother sits at the old-fashioned dining-room table peeling carrots and 
talking as she looks off screen.

				MOTHER 
		You always only saw the worst in people.  
		You never could get along with anyone at 
		school.  You were always outta step with the 
		world.  Even when you got famous, you still 
		distrusted the world.'

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET-DAY

A pretty Manhattan street with sidewalk trees, brownstones, a school; people 
mill about, some strolling and carrying bundles, others buried.  The screen 
shows the whole length of the sidewalk, a street, and part of the sidewalk 
beyond.  As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in 
the distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, 
as Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation.  They eventually move 
past the camera and off screen.  Traffic noise is heard in the background.

				ALVY 
		I distinctly heard it.  He muttered under 
		his breath, "Jew." 

				ROB 
		You're crazy!

				ALVY 
		No, I'm not.  We were walking off the 
		tennis court, and you know, he was there 
		and me and his wife, and he looked at her 
		and then they both looked at me, and under 
		his breath he said, "Jew."

				ROB 
		Alvy, you're a total paranoid.

				ALVY 
		Wh- How am I a paran-?  Well, I pick up on 
		those kind o' things.  You know, I was 
		having lunch with some guys from NBC, so 
		I said ... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" 
		and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" 
		Not, did you, didchoo eat?  Jew?  No, not 
		did you eat, but Jew eat?  Jew.  You get it?  
		Jew eat?

				ROB 
		Ah, Max, you, uh ...

				ALVY 
		Stop calling me Max.

				ROB 
		Why, Max?  It's a good name for you.  Max, 
		you see conspiracies in everything.

				ALVY 
		No, I don't!  You know, I was in a record 
		store.  Listen to this -so I know there's 
		this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and 
		he's lookin' at me in a funny way and 
		smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a 
		sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, 
		Wagner-so I know what he's really tryin' 
		to tell me very significantly Wagner. 

				ROB 
		Right, Max.  California, Max.

				ALVY 
		Ah.

				ROB 
		Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.

				ALVY 
		Forget it, Max.

				ROB 
		-we move to sunny L.A. All of show business 
		is out there, Max.

				ALVY
		No, I cannot.  You keep bringing it up, but 
		I don't wanna live in a city where the only 
		cultural advantage is that you can make a 
		right turn on a red light.

				ROB
			(Checking his watch) 
		Right, Max, forget it.  Aren't you gonna be 
		late for meeting Annie?

				ALVY 
		I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman.  
		I think I have a few minutes left.  Right?

EXT. BEEKMAN THEATER-DAY

Alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him 
just inside the glass doors.  The sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, 
can be heard while he looks around waiting for, Annie. A man in a black leather
jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, Alvy.  He looks at him, 
then moves away.  He stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at Alvy
again.  Alvy looks away, then back at the man.  The man continues to stare. 
Alvy scratches his head, looking for Annie and trying not to notice the man. 
The man, still staring, walks back to Alvy.

				1ST MAN 
		Hey, you on television?

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head) 
		No. Yeah, once in a while.  You know, 
		like occasionally.

				1ST MAN 
		What's your name?

				ALVY 
			(Clearing his throat) 
		You wouldn't know it.  It doesn't matter.  
		What's the difference?

				1ST MAN 
		You were on ... uh, the ... uh, the Johnny 
		Carson, right?  

				ALVY 
		Once in a while, you know.  I mean, you 
		know, every now-

				1ST MAN 
		What's your name?

Alvy  is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks; more and more people 
move through the doors of the theater.

				ALVY 
			(Nervously) 
		I'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford. 

				1ST MAN 
			(Laughing) 
		Come on.

				ALVY
		Alvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks 
		very much ... for everything.

They shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm.  The man in turn looks over his 
shoulder and motions to another man. All excited now, he points to Alvy and 
calls out. Alvy looks impatient.

				1ST MAN 
		Hey!

				2ND MAN 
			(Off screen) 
		What?

				1ST MAN 
		This is Alvy Singer!

				ALVY 
		Fellas ... you know-Jesus!  Come on!

				1ST MAN 
			(Overlapping, ignoring Alvy) 
		This guy's on television!  Alvy
		Singer, right?  Am I right?

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping 1st man) 
		Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break.
		Jesus Christ!

				1ST MAN 
			(Still ignoring Alvy's protestations) 
		This guy's on television.

				ALVY 
		I need a large polo mallet!

				2ND MAN 
			(Moving into the screen) 
		Who's on television?

				1ST MAN
		This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.

				ALVY 
			(Annoyed) 
		Fellas, what is this-a meeting o' the 
		teamsters?  You know.. .

				2ND MAN 
			(Also ignoring Alvy) 
		What program?

				1ST MAN 
			(Holding out a matchbook) 
		Can I have your autograph?

				ALVY 
		You don't want my autograph.

				1ST MAN 
			(Overlapping, Alvy's  speech) 
		Yeah, I do.  It's for my girl friend.  
		Make it out to Ralph.

				ALVY 
			(Taking the matchbook and pen and 
			writing) 
		Your girl friend's name is Ralph?

				1ST MAN 
		It's for my brudder. 
			(To passersby) 
		Alvy Singer!  Hey!  This is Alvy-

				2ND MAN 
			(To Alvy, overlapping 1st man's speech) 
		You really Alvy Singer, the ... the 
		TV star?

Nodding his head yes, Alvy shoves 2nd man aside and moves to the curb of the 
sidewalk.  The two men follow, still talking over the traffic noise.

				1ST MAN 
		-Singer!

				2ND MAN 
		Alvy Singer over here!

A cab moves into the frame and stops by the curb.  Alvy moves over to it about 
to get in.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the two men and 
			stuttering) 
		I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas. 
			(As Alvy opens the cab door, the 
			two men still behind him, Annie 
			gets out) 
		Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of 
		the Panama Canal?

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping Alvy) 
		Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?  

Annie closes the cab door and she and Alvy move over to the ticket booth of 
the theater as they continue to talk.

				ALVY 
		Bad mood?  I'm standing with the cast of 
		"The Godfather."

				ANNIE 
		You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.

				ALVY 
		Deal!  I'm dealing with two guys named 
		Cheech!

				ANNIE 
		Okay. 
			(They move into the ticket line, 
			still talking.  A billboard next to 
			them reads "INGMAR BERGMAN'S 'FACE 
			TO FACE ,'LIV ULLMANN") 
		Please, I have a headache, all right?

				ALVY 
		Hey, you are in a bad mood.  You-you-
		you must be getting your period.

				ANNIE 
		I'm not getting my period.  Jesus, every 
		time anything out of the ordinary happens, 
		you think that I'm getting my period!

They move over to the ticket counter, people in front of them buying tickets 
and walking off screen.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		A li-little louder.  I think one of them 
		may have missed it! 
			(To the ticket clerk) 
		H'm, has the picture started yet?

				TICKET CLERK 
		It started two minutes ago.

				ALVY 
			(Hitting his hand on the counter) 
		That's it!  Forget it!  I-I can't go in.

				ANNIE 
		Two minutes, Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie)
		No, I'm sorry, I can't do it.  We-we've 
		blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I 
		can't go in in the middle.

				ANNIE 
		In the middle? 
			(Alvy nods his head yes and let's
			out an exasperated sigh) 
		We'll only miss the titles.  They're in 
		Swedish.

				ALVY 
		You wanna get coffee for two hours or 
		something?  We'll go next-

				ANNIE 
		Two hours?  No, u-uh, I'm going in.  
		I'm going in. 

She moves past the ticket clerk.

				ALVY 
			(Waving to Annie) 
		Go ahead.  Good-bye. 

Annie moves back to Alvy and takes his arm.

				ANNIE 
		Look, while we're talking we could be 
		inside, you know that?

				ALVY 
			(Watching people with tickets move 
			past them) 
		Hey, can we not stand here and argue in 
		front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.

				ANNIE 
		Alright.  All right, all right, so whatta 
		you wanna do?

				ALVY 
		I don't know now.  You-you wanna go to 
		another movie? 
			(Annie nods her head and shrugs 
			her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, 
			gesturing with his band, looks at 
			her) 
		So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, come on, we've seen it.  I'm not in 
		the mood to see a four-hour documentary 
		on Nazis.

				ALVY 
		Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't ... I-I-I've 
		gotta see a picture exactly from the start 
		to the finish, 'cause-'cause I'm anal.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing now) 
		H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.

INT. THEATER LOBBY.

A lined-up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater, Alvy and 
Annie among them.  A bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing
scene.

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Loudly to his companion right 
			behind Alvy and Annie) 
		We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.  
		It is not one of his best.  It lacks a 
		cohesive structure.  You know, you get 
		the feeling that he's not absolutely sure 
		what it is he wants to say.  'Course, I've 
		always felt he was essentially a-a technical 
		film maker.  Granted, La Strada was a great 
		film.  Great in its use of negative energy 
		more than anything else.  But that simple 
		cohesive core ... 

Alvy, reacting to the man's loud monologue, starts to get annoyed, while Annie 
begins to read her newspaper.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the man's speech) 
		I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.

				ANNIE 
			(Reading) 
		Well, stop listening to him.

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Overlapping Alvy and Annie) 
		You know, it must need to have had its 
		leading from one thought to another.  
		You know what I'm talking about?

				ALVY 
			(Sighing) 
		He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

				MAN IN LINE 
		Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or 
		Satyricon, I found it incredibly ... 
		indulgent.  You know, he really is.  He's 
		one of the most indulgent film makers.  He 
		really is-

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		Key word here is "indulgent."

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Overlapping) 
		-without getting ... well, let's put it 
		this way ...

				ALVY 
			(To Annie, who is still reading, 
			overlapping the man in line who is 
			still talking) 
		What are you depressed about?

				ANNIE 
		I missed my therapy.  I overslept.

				ALVY  
		How can you possibly oversleep?

				ANNIE 
		The alarm clock.

				ALVY 
			(Gasping) 
		You know what a hostile gesture that is 
		to me?

				ANNIE 
		I know-because of our sexual problem, 
		right?

				ALVY 
		Hey, you ... everybody in line at the 
		New Yorker has to know our rate of 
		intercourse?

				MAN IN LINE
		- It's like Samuel Beckett, you know-
		I admire the technique but he doesn't ... 
		he doesn't hit me on a gut level.

				ALVY 
			(To Annie) 
		I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.

The man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie talk.

				ANNIE 
		Stop it, Alvy!

				ALVY 
			(Wringing his hands) 
		Well, he's spitting on my neck!  You know, 
		he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

				MAN IN LINE 
		And then, the most important thing of all 
		is a comedian's vision.

				ANNIE 
		And you know something else?  You know, 
		you're so egocentric that if I miss my 
		therapy you can think of it in terms of 
		how it affects you!

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Lighting a cigarette while he talks) 
		Gal gun-shy is what it is.

				ALVY
			(Reacting again to the man in line) 
		Probably on their first date, right?

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Still going on) 
		It's a narrow view.

				ALVY
		Probably met by answering an ad in the 
		New York Review of Books.  "Thirtyish 
		academic wishes to meet woman who's 
		interested in Mozart, James Joyce and 
		sodomy." 
			(He sighs; then to Annie) 
		Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?

				ANNIE 
		Oh!

				ALVY  
		I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal 
		for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

				ANNIE 
		Okay, I'm very sorry.  My sexual problem!  
		Okay, my sexual problem!  Huh?

The man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away.

				ALVY 
		I never read that.  That was-that was 
		Henry James, right?  Novel, uh, the 
		sequel to Turn of the Screw?  My Sexual ...

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Even louder now) 
		It's the influence of television.  Yeah, 
		now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms 
		of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, 
		you understand?  A hot medium ... as opposed 
		to a ...

				ALVY 
			(More and more aggravated) 
		What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' 
		horse manure.

				MAN IN LINE     
		... as opposed to a print ...

Alvy steps forward, waving his hands in frustration, and stands facing the 
camera.

				ALVY 
			(Sighing and addressing the audience) 
		What do you do when you get stuck in a movie 
		line with a guy like this behind you?  I mean, 
		it's just maddening!

The man in line moves toward Alvy.  Both address the audience now.

				MAN IN LINE 
		Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion?  
		It's a free country!

				ALVY 
		I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta 
		give it so loud?  I mean, aren't you ashamed 
		to pontificate like that?  And-and the funny 
		part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't
		know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work!

				MAN IN LINE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Wait a minute!  Really?  Really?  I happen to 
		teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media 
		and Culture"!  So I think that my insights 
		into Mr. McLuhan-well, have a great deal of 
		validity.

				ALVY 
		Oh, do yuh?

				MAN IN LINE 
		Yes.

				ALVY 
		Well, that's funny, because I happen to 
		have Mr. McLuhan right here.  So ... so, 
		here, just let me-I mean, all right.  Come 
		over here ... a second.

Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back 
of the crowded lobby.  He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and 
pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster.

				MAN IN LINE 
		Oh.

				ALVY 
			(To McLuban) 
		Tell him.

				MCLUHAN 
			(To the man in line) 
		I hear-I heard what you were saying.  
		You-you know nothing of my work.  You 
		mean my whole fallacy is wrong.  How you 
		ever got to teach a course in anything is 
		totally amazing.

				ALVY 
			(To the camera) 
		Boy, if life were only like this!

INT. BEDROOM-NIGHT 

Annie is sitting up in bed reading.

				ALVY 
			(Off screen) 
		Boy, those guys in the French Resistance 
		were really brave, you know?  Got to listen 
		to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

				ANNIE 
		M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself 
		how I'd stand up under torture.

				ALVY 
			(Off screen) 
		You?  You kiddin'? 
			(He moves into the frame, lying across 
			the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a 
			face) 
		If the Gestapo would take away your 
		Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em 
		everything.

				ANNIE 
		That movie makes me feel guilty.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.

He starts kissing Annie's arm.  She gets annoyed and continues to read.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, I ...

				ALVY 
		What-what-what-what's the matter?

				ANNIE 
		I-you know, I don't wanna.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie, reacting) 
		What-what-I don't ... It's not natural!  
		We're sleeping in a bed together.  You 
		know, it's been a long time.

				ANNIE 
		I know, well, it's just that-you know, I 
		mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, 
		so I have to rest my voice.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie again) 
		It's always some kind of an excuse.  It's- 
		You know, you used to think that I was 
		very sexy.  What ... When we first started 
		going out, we had sex constantly ... We're-
		we're probably listed in the Guinness Book 
		of World Records.

				ANNIE 
			(Patting Alvy's band solicitously) 
		I know.  Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll 
		pass, it's just that I'm going through a 
		phase, that's all.

				ALVY 
		M'm.

				ANNIE 
		I mean, you've been married before, you 
		know how things can get.  You were very 
		hot for Allison at first.

								CUT TO:


INT. BACK STAGE OF AUDITORIUM - NIGHT.

Allison, clipboard in band, walks about the wings, stopping to talk to various 
people.  Musicians, performers and technicians mill about, busy with activity. 
Allison wears a large "ADLAI" button, as do the people around her.  The sounds 
of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally, 
interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience.  Allison 
stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear "ADLAI" buttons.

				ALLISON 
			(Looking down at the clipboard) 
		Ma'am, you're on right after this man ... 
		about twenty minutes, something like that.

				WOMAN 
		Oh, thank you.

Alvy moves into the frame behind Allison.  He taps her on the shoulder; she 
turns to face him.

				ALVY 
			(Coughing) 
		Excuse ... excuse me, when do I go on?

				ALLISON 
			(Looking down at the clipboard) 
		Who are you?

				ALVY
		Alvy ... Alvy Singer.  I'm a comedian.

				ALLISON 
		Oh, comedian.  Yes.  Oh, uh ... you're 
		on next.

				ALVY 
			(Rubbing his hands together 
			nervously) 
		What do you mean, next?

				ALLISON 
			(Laughing) 
		Uh ... I mean you're on right after 
		this act.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		No, it can't be, because he's a comic.

				ALLISON 
		Yes.

				ALVY 
		So what are you telling me, you're 
		putting on two comics in a row?

				ALLISON 
		Why not?

				ALVY  
		No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't 
		... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.

				ALLISON 
		It's okay.

				ALVY 
		No, because they're-they're laughing, so 
			(He starts laughing nervously) 
		I-I-I'd rather not.  If you don't mind, 
		I prefer-

				ALLISON 
			(Overlapping) 
		Will you relax, please?  They're gonna 
		love you, I know.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		I prefer not to, because ... look, 
		they're laughing at him.  See, so what 
		are yuh telling me-

They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings.

				ALLISON 
			(Overlapping) 
		Yes.

				ALVY 
(Overlapping) 
		-that I've got to ... ah ... ah ... 
		They're gonna laugh at him for a couple 
		minutes, then I gotta go out there, I 
		gotta ... get laughs, too.  How much can 
		they laugh? 
			(Off screen) 
		They-they they're laughed out.

				ALLISON 
			(Off screen) 
		Do you feel all right?

As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of 
view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai
Stevenson.  The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in 
clusters around the room.

The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage.  Alvy is swinging
his hands nervously.

				COMEDIAN 
			(Off screen, onstage) 
		You know ...

Alvy starts looking Allison up and down; people in the background mill about.

				ALVY 
			(Above the chatter around him) 
		Look, what's your-what's your name?

				COMEDIAN 
			(Off screen)  
		... General Eisenhower is not ...

				ALLISON 
			(Looking out at the stage) 
		Allison.

				ALVY   
		Yeah?  Allison what?

				ALLISON 
			(Still looking off screen) 
		Portchnik.

				COMEDIAN     
		... a group from the ...

				ALVY
			(Coughing) 
		Thank you. I-I don't know why they would 
		have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... 
			(He clears his throat) 
		Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political 
		comedian at all.

The audience starts to laugh.

				ALVY 
		I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... 
		a woman in the Eisenhower Administration 
		... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to 
		me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I 
		was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what 
		Eisenhower has been doing to the country 
		for the last eight years. 

The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage.

INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM.

Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing.  There are books all over the room; 
a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits 
on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him.

				ALVY  
		H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with 
		this, because it-I can't get it off my 
		mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!

				ALLISON 
		Well, I'm getting tired of it.  I need 
		your attention.

Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, 
gesturing with his hands.

				ALVY 
		It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense.  
		He drove past the book depository and the 
		police said conclusively that it was an 
		exit wound.  So-how is it possible for 
		Oswald to have fired from two angles at 
		once?  It doesn't make sense.

				ALLISON 
		Alvy.

Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs.  He then snaps his 
fingers and starts walking again.

				ALVY 
		I'll tell you this!  He was not marksman 
		enough to hit a moving target at that 
		range.  But ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		if there was a second assassin ... it- 
		That's it!

Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up 
from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.

				ALLISON 
		We've been through this.

				ALVY 
		If they-they recovered the shells from 
		that rifle.

				ALLISON 
			(Moving back to the bed and 
			lighting a cigarette) 
		Okay.  All right, so whatta yuh saying, 
		now?  That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren 
		Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?

				ALVY 
		Well, why not?

				ALLISON 
		Yeah, Earl Warren?

				ALVY 
			(Moving toward the bed) 
		Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

				ALLISON 
		Lyndon Johnson?

				ALVY 
			(Propping one knee on the bed 
			and gesturing) 
		L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a 
		politician.  You know the ethics those 
		guys have?  It's like-uh, a notch 
		underneath child molester.

				ALLISON 
		Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head) 
		Tsch.

				ALLISON 
		The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar 
		Hoover and oil companies and the 
		Pentagon and the men's-room attendant 
		at the White House?

Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking 
again.

				ALVY 
		I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room 
		attendant.

				ALLISON 
		You're using this conspiracy theory as 
		an excuse to avoid sex with me.

				ALVY 
		Oh, my God! 
			(Then, to the camera) 
		She's right!  Why did I turn off Allison 
		Portchnik?  She was-she was beautiful.  She 
		was willing.  She was real ... intelligent. 
			(Sighing) 
		Is it the old Groucho Marx joke?  That-that 
		I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that 
		would have someone like me for a member?

EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach 
house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the 
house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters 
crawling on the floor.  Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of 
groceries sit on the counter.  There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator. 

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, now don't panic.  Please.

				ALVY 
		Look, I told you it was a ... mistake 
		to ever bring a live thing in the house.

				ANNIE
		Stop it!  Don't ... don't do that!  There.
 
The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor.  Annie, bolding out a wooden 
paddle, tries to shove them onto it.

				ALVY 
		Well, maybe we should just call the police.  
		Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.

				ANNIE 
		Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for 
		God's sake. 

				ALVY 
		If they're only babies, then you pick 
		'em up.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, all right.  All right!  It's all 
		right.  Here.

She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail.  Laughing, 
she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.

				ALVY 
		Don't give it to me.  Don't!

				ANNIE 
			(Hysterically) 
		Oooh!  Here!  Here!

				ALVY 
			(Pointing) 
		Look!  Look, one crawled behind the 
		refrigerator.  It'll turn up in our bed 
		at night. 
			(They move over to the refrigerator; 
			Alvy moves as close to the wall as 
			possible as Annie, covering her mouth 
			and laughing hysterically, teasingly 
			dangles a lobster in front of him) 
		Will you get outta here with that thing?  
		Jesus!

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing, to the lobster) 
		Get him!

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		Talk to him.  You speak shellfish! 
			(He moves over to the stove and 
			takes the lid of a large steamer 
			filled with boiling water) 
		Hey, look ... put it in the pot.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I can't!  I can't put him in the pot.  I 
		can't put a live thing in hot water.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		Gimme!  Gimme!  Let me do it!  What-what's 
		he think we're gonna do, take him to the 
		movies?

Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it 
gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) 
		Oh, God!  Here yuh go!  Oh, good, now 
		he'll think- 
			(She screams) 
		Aaaah!  Okay.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping Annie) 
		Okay, it's in.  It's definitely in the pot!

				ANNIE 
		All right.  All right.  All right.

She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster.  Smiling, 
she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to 
push it from the wall.

				ALVY 
		Annie, there's a big lobster behind 
		the refrigerator.  I can't get it out.  
		This thing's heavy.  Maybe if I put a 
		little dish of butter sauce here with a 
		nutcracker, it will run out the other 
		side, you know what I mean?

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Yeah.  I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna 
		get my camera.

				ALVY 
		You know, I-I think ... if I could pry 
		this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 
		'cause they don't have legs.  They don't 
		run around.

Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. 
Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the 
chandelier.  Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink.  
Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.

				ANNIE 
		Great!  Great! 
			(Screaming) 
		Goddammit! 
			(Screaming) 
		Ooooh!  These are ... p-p-p-pick this 
		lobster up.  Hold it, please!

				ALVY 
		All right!  All right!  All right!  All 
		right!  Whatta yuh mean?  Are yuh gonna 
		take pictures now?

				ANNIE 
		It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll 
		be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely!

				ALVY 
			(Picking up the lobster Annie 
			placed on the counter earlier) 
		All right, here!  Oh, God, it's disgusting!

Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and 
making a face.

				ANNIE 
		Don't be a jerk.  One more, Alvy, please, 
		one more picture. 
			(Reluctantly Alvy picks up the 
			lobster again as Annie takes 
			another picture) 
		Oh, oh, good, good!

EXT. OCEAN FRONT-DUSK.

The camera pans Annie and Alvy as they walk along the shore.

				ALVY 
		So, so-well, here's what I wanna know.  
		W-what ... 
			(He clears his throat) 
		Am I your first big romance?

				ANNIE 
		Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh.  No.

				ALVY 
		Well, then, w-who was?

				ANNIE 
		Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, 
		from Chippewa Falls High School. 

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK OF DENNIS LEANING AGAINST A CAR - NIGHT

Behind him is a movie theater with "MARILYN MONROE, 'MISFITS' " on the marquee.
He looks at his watch as the younger Annie, in a beehive hairdo, moves into the
frame.  They kiss quickly and look at each other, smiling.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(Off screen) 
		Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid 
		probably, would meetcha in front of the 
		movie house on Saturday night.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked 
		like then.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(Off screen, laughing) 
		Oh, I can imagine.  P-p-probably the 
		wife of an astronaut.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		Then there was Jerry, the actor.

								CUT TO:

FLASHBACK OF BRICK-WALLED APARTMENT - NIGHT

The younger, Annie and Jerry lean against the wall. Jerry is running his band 
down Annie's bare arm. Annie and Alvy walk into the room, observing the younger
Annie, in jeans and T-shirt, with Jerry.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(Laughing) 
		Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		I look pretty.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but 
		that guy with you ...

				JERRY 
		Acting is like an exploration of the soul. 
		I-it's very religious.  Uh, like, uh, a 
		kind of liberating consciousness.  It's 
		like a visual poem.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		Is he kidding with that crap?

				YOUNGER ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, right.  Right, yeah, I think I 
		know exactly what you mean, when you 
		say "religious."

				ALVY 
			(Incredulous, to Annie) 
		You do?

				ANNIE 
			(Still watching) 
		Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.

				ALVY 
		Hey, that was last year.

				JERRY 
		It's like when I think of dying.  You 
		know how I would like to die?

				YOUNGER ANNIE 
		No, how?

				JERRY 
		I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		Heavy!  Eaten by some squirrels.

				ANNIE'S VOICE 
		Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, 
		and look at him, he's neat-looking and he 
		was emotional ... Y-hey, I don't think you 
		like emotion too much.

Jerry stops rubbing the younger Annie's arm and slides down to the floor as 
she raises her foot toward his chest.

				JERRY 
		Touch my heart ... with your foot. 

				ALVY'S VOICE 
		I-I may throw up!

								CUT BACK TO:

EXTERIOR.  BEACH-DUSK

It's now sunset, the water reflecting the last light.  The camera moves over 
the scene.  The off screen voices of Alvy and Annie are heard as they walk, the
camera always one step ahead of them.

				ANNIE 
		He was creepy.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I 
		came along. 

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, really?  Well, la-de-da!

				ALVY 
		La-de-da.  If I-if anyone had ever told 
		me that I would be taking out a girl who 
		used expressions like "la-de-da" . . .

				ANNIE 
		Oh, that's right.  That you really like 
		those New York girls. 

				ALVY 
		Well, no ... not just, not only.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I'd say so.  You married-

INT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT-NIGHT

A cocktail party is in progress, the rooms crowded with guests as Alvy and 
Robin make their way through the people.  A waiter, carrying a tray, walks 
past them.  Alvy reaches out to pick up a glass; Robin reaches over and picks 
it of the tray first.  There is much low-key chatter in the background.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		-two of them.

				ROBIN 
		There's Henry Drucker.  He has a chair 
		in history at Princeton.  Oh, the short 
		man is Hershel Kaminsky.  He has a chair 
		in philosophy at Cornell.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, two more chairs and they got a 
		dining-room set.

				ROBIN 
		Why are you so hostile?

				ALVY 
			(Sighing) 
		'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on 
		television.

				ROBIN 
			(Squinting) 
		Is that Paul Goodman?  No. And be nice 
		to the host because he's publishing my 
		book.  Hi, Doug!  Douglas Wyatt.  
		"A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart."

They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped 
in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them.

				ALVY 
			(Taking Robin's hand) 
		I'm so tired of spending evenings making 
		fake insights with people who work for 
		Dysentery.

				ROBIN 
		Commentary.

				ALVY 
		Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and 
		Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.

				ROBIN 
		No jokes-these are friends, okay?

INT. BEDROOM

Alvy sits on the foot of the bed watching the Knicks game on television.

				TV ANNOUNCER 
			(Off screen) 
		Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New 
		York Knicks.

Robin enters the room, slamming the door.

				ROBIN 
		Here you are.  There's people out there.

				ALVY 
		Hey, you wouldn't believe this.  Two 
		minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen 
		points, and now ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		they're ahead two points.

				ROBIN 
		Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group 
		of pituitary cases trying to stuff the 
		ball through a hoop?

				ALVY 
			(Looking at Robin) 
		What's fascinating is that it's physical.  
		You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, 
		they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant 
		and have no idea what's going on.  But on the 
		other hand ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

Alvy reaches over, pulls Robin down onto the bed.  He kisses her and moves 
farther up on the bed.

				ROBIN 
		Stop acting out.

She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy.

				ALVY 
		No, it'll be great!  It'll be great, 
		be-because all those Ph.D.'s are in 
		there, you know, like ... discussing 
		models of alienation and we'll be in 
		here quietly humping.

He pulls Robin toward him, caressing her as she pulls herself away.

				ROBIN 
		Alvy, don't!  You're using sex to 
		express hostility.

				ALVY 
		"'Why-why do you always r-reduce my 
		animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?' 
			(Clears his throat) 
		he said as he removed her brassiere..."

				ROBIN 
			(Pulling away again) 
		There are people out there from The New 
		Yorker magazine.  My God!  What would they 
		think?

She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress.  She turns and moves toward the 
door.

INT. APARTMENT-NIGHT

Robin and Alvy are in bed.  The room is in darkness.  Outside, a siren starts 
blaring.

				ROBIN 
		Oh, I'm sorry!

				ALVY 
		Don't get upset!

				ROBIN 
		Dammit!  I was so close.

She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side.  Alvy turns to her.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		Jesus, last night it was some guy honking 
		his car horn.  I mean, the city can't 
		close down.  You know, what-whatta yuh 
		gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the 
		airport, too?  No more flights so we can 
		have sex?

				ROBIN 
			(Reaching over for her eyeglasses 
			on the night table) 
		I'm too tense.  I need a Valium.  My 
		analyst says I should live in the country 
		and not in New York.

				ALVY 
		Well, I can't li- We can't have this 
		discussion all the time.  The country 
		makes me nervous.  There's ... You got 
		crickets and it-it's quiet ... there's 
		no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, 
		there's the screens with the dead moths 
		behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the 
		Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and 
		Terry-

				ROBIN 
			(Interrupting) 
		Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm 
		too tense.  Where's the goddamn Valium?

She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed.

				ALVY 
		Hey, come on, it's quiet now.  We can-we 
		can start again.

				ROBIN 
		I can't.

				ALVY
		What-

				ROBIN
		My head is throbbing.

				ALVY
		Oh, you got a headache!

				ROBIN
		I have a headache.

				ALVY
		Bad?

				ROBIN
		Oswald and ghosts.

				ALVY
		Jesus!

He begins to get out of bed.

				ROBIN 
		Where are you going?

				ALVY 
		Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a 
		series of cold showers.

EXT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM OF THE TENNIS CLUB.

Rob and Alvy, carrying tennis rackets, come through the door of the locker 
room to the lobby.  They are dressed in tennis whites.  They walk toward the 
indoor court.

				ROB
 			Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to 
		the showers-

				ALVY
		Right, right, so g-get back to what we 
		were discussing, the failure of the 
		country to get behind New York City is-is 
		anti-Semitism.

				ROB 
		Max, the city is terribly worried.

				ALVY 
		But the- I'm not discussing politics or 
		economics.  This is foreskin.

				ROB 
		No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient 
		out.  Every time some group disagrees with 
		you it's because of anti-Semitism.

				ALVY 
		Don't you see?  The rest of the country looks 
		upon New York like we're-we're left-wing 
		Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers.  
		I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I 
		live here.

				ROB 
		Max, if we lived in California, we could 
		play outdoors every day, in the sun.

				ALVY 
		Sun is bad for yuh.  Everything our parents 
		said was good is bad.  Sun, milk, red meat, 
		college ...

INT. TENNIS COURT

Annie and Janet, in tennis whites, stand on the court holding tennis rackets 
and balls.  They are chattering and giggling.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I know, but ooh- here he comes.  Okay. 

Rob and Alvy enter the court and walk over to the two women.  Rob kisses Janet 
and makes introduction.

				ROB 
		You know Alvy?

				JANET 
		Oh, hi, Alvy.

				ANNIE 
			(To Rob) 
		How are yuh?

				ROB 
			(To Alvy) 
		You know Annie?

				JANET 
		I'm sorry.  This is Annie Hall.

				ALVY 
		Hi.

				ANNIE 
		Hi.

Annie and Alvy shake hands.

				JANET 
			(Laughing) 
		Alvy.

				ROB 
			(Eager to begin) 
		Who's playing who here?  Alvy Well, uh ... 
		you and me against them?

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping Alvy) 
		Well ... so ... I can't play too good, 
		you know.

				JANET 
			(Laughing) 
		I've had four lessons!

The group, laughing and chatting, divide up-Rob and Annie moving to the other 
side of the net, Alvy and Janet standing where they are.  They start to play 
mixed doubles, each taking turns and playing well. At one point in the game, 
Annie starts to talk to Rob, then turns and sees a ball heading toward her.

				ALVY  
			(Hitting the halt back) 
		Holy gods!

INT. LOBBY

Alvy, dressed, puts things into a gym bag.  One knee is on the bench and his 
back is turned from the entrance. Annie walks toward the entrance door dressed 
in street clothes and carrying her tennis bag over her shoulder.  Seeing Alvy,
she stops and turns.

				ANNIE 
		Hi.  Hi, hi.

				ALVY 
			(Looking over his shoulder) 
		Hi.  Oh, hi.  Hi.

				ANNIE 
			(Hands clasped in front of her, 
			smiling) 
		Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly 
		toward the door.

				ALVY 
			(Clearing his throat) 
		You-you play ... very well.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah?  So do you.  Oh, God, whatta-
			(Making sounds and laughing) 
		whatta dumb thing to say, right?  I mean, 
		you say it, "You play well," and right 
		away ... I have to say well.  Oh, oh ... 
		God, Annie. 
			(She gestures with her hand) 
		Well ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da, 
		la-la.

She turns around and moves toward the door.

				ALVY 
			(Still looking over his shoulder) 
		Uh ... you-you wanna lift?

				ANNIE 
			(Turning and aiming her thumb over 
			her shoulder) 
		Oh, why-uh ... y-y-you gotta car?

				ALVY 
		No, um ... I was gonna take a cab.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, no, I have a car.

				ALVY 
		You have a car? 
			(Annie smiles, hands folded in 
			front of her) 
		So ... 
			(Clears his throat) 
		I don't understand why ... if you have a 
		car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do 
		you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?

				ANNIE 
		I don't ... 
			(Laughing) 
		I don't ... Geez, I don't know, I've ... 
		I wa- This ... yeah, I got this VW out 
		there ... 
			(Laughing and gesturing toward 
			the door) 
		What a jerk, yeah.  Would you like a lift?

				ALVY 
			(Zipping up his bag) 
		Sure.  W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?

				ANNIE 
		Me?  Oh, downtown!

				ALVY 
		Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.

				ALVY 
		Uh, well, you just said you were going 
		downtown.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah, well, I'm, but I ...

Alvy picks up his bag and moves toward the door. As he turns his bag around, 
the handle of the tennis racket bits Annie between the legs.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		So sorry.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I mean, I can go uptown, too.  I live 
		uptown, but ... uh, what the hell, I mean, 
		it'd be nice having company, you know 
		I mean, I hate driving alone.

				ALVY 
			(Making sounds) 
		Yeah.

They walk out the door.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET- DAY

Alvy and Annie in the VW as Annie speeds down a city street near the East River.

				ALVY 
		So, how long do you know Janet?  Where 
		do you know her from?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, I'm in her acting class.

				ALVY 
		Oh - you're an actress.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I do commercials, sort of ...

She zooms down the wrong lane, cars swerving out of her way.  A horn blows.

				ALVY 
		I, uh ... well, you're not from New 
		York, right?

				ANNIE 
		No, Chippewa Falls.

				ALVY 
		Right! 
			(A pause) 
		Where?

				ANNIE 
		Wisconsin.

				ALVY 
			(Finally reacting) 
		Uh, you're driving a-

				ANNIE 
		Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- 
			(A car moves closer to the VW, 
			almost on top of it in the wrong 
			direction.  Annie swerves away at 
			the very last minute)
		-a very good driver. 
			(Alvy rubs his head nervously, 
			staring out the window as Annie 
			speeds along) 
		So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?

Annie looks down beside her, searching for the gum.

				ALVY
		No, no thanks.  Hey, don't-

				ANNIE
		Well, where is it?  I-

				ALVY 
		No, no, no, no, you just ... just watch 
		the road.  I'll get it-

				ANNIE 
		Okay.

They both fumble around in her pocketbook.  Alvy looks up to see the entire 
front of a truck in Annie's windshield.  She swerves just in time.

				ALVY 
		-for yuh.

				ANNIE 
		Okay, that's good.

Alvy continues to look for the gum while Annie zooms down the city streets.

				ANNIE 
		All right.

				ALVY 
		I'll getcha a piece.

				ANNIE	
		Yeah ... so, listen-you drive?

				ALVY
		Do I drive?  Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta 
		problem with driving.

				ANNIE	
		Oh, you do?

				ALVY	
		Yeah.  I got, uh, I got a license but I 
		have too much hostility.

				ANNIE	
		Oh, right.

				ALVY	
		Nice car.

				ANNIE 
			(A bit rapidly)   
		Huh?

				ALVY 
		You keep it nice. 
			(He pulls a half-eaten sandwich 
			out of her bag) 
		Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?

				ANNIE 
		Huh?  Oh, yeah.

EXT. STREET-DAY

Cars are parked on both sides of the street as the VW rounds the corner.

				ANNIE 
		I live over here.  Oh, my God!  Look!  
		There's a parking space!  

With brakes squealing, Annie turns the VW sharply into the parking spot.  
Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car.

				ALVY   
		That's okay, you ... we-we can walk to 
		the curb from here.

				ANNIE 
		Don't be funny.

				ALVY   
		You want your tennis stuff?

				ANNIE 
		Huh?  Oh ... yeah.

				ALVY   
		You want your gear?  Here you go.

Alvy reaches into the back of the car and takes out tennis equipment.  He 
hands her her things.  People pass by on the street.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Well...

				ALVY 
			(Sighing) 
		Well, thanks, thank you.  You-you're 
		a wonderful tennis player.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh.

Alvy shakes hands with Annie.

				ALVY 
		You're the worst driver I've ever seen 
		in my life . . . that's including any place 
		... the worst ... Europe, United ... any 
		place ... Asia.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah.

				ALVY 
		And I love what you're wearin'.

Alvy touches the tie Annie is wearing around her neck.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, you do?  Yeah?  Oh, well, it's uh 
		... this is, uh ... this tie is a present, 
		from Grammy Hall.

Annie flips the bottom of the tie.

				ALVY  
		Who?  Grammy?  Grammy Hall?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing and nodding her head) 
		Yeah, my grammy.

				ALVY 
		You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you 
		do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah, I know.

				ALVY 
		Your grammy!

				ANNIE 
		I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?

				ALVY 
		Jesus, my-my grammy ... n-never gave 
		gifts, you know.  She-she was	too busy 
		getting raped by Cossacks.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Well ...

				ALVY	
		Well ... thank you again.

				ANNIE	
		Oh, yeah, yeah.

				ALVY	
		I'll see yuh.

				ANNIE	
			(Overlapping, gesturing) 
		Hey, well, listen ... hey, you wanna
		come upstairs and, uh ... and have a 
		glass of wine and something?  Aw, no, 
		I mean ... I mean, you don't have to, 
		you're probably late and everything else ...

				ALVY 
		No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure. 

				ANNIE 
		You sure?

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		No, I got time. 

				ANNIE 
		Okay.

				ALVY 
		Sure, I got ... I got nothing, uh, 
		nothing till my analyst's appointment.

They move toward Annie's apartment building.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, you see an analyst?

				ALVY 
		Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years. 

				ANNIE 
		Fifteen years?

				ALVY 
		Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more 
		year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.

				ANNIE 
		Fifteen-aw, come on, you're . . . yeah, 
		really?

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT

Alvy, standing, looks around the apartment.  There are lots of books, framed 
photographs on the white wall.  A terrace can be seen from the window.  He 
picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen 
carrying two glasses.  She hands them to Alvy.

				ALVY 
		Sylvia Plath.

				ANNIE 
		M'hm...

				ALVY
		Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide 
		was misinterpreted as romantic, by the 
		college-girl mentality.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah.

				ALVY 
		Oh, sorry.

				ANNIE 
		Right.  Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, 
		some of her poems seem - neat, you know.

				ALVY
		Neat?

				ANNIE 
		Neat, yeah.

				ALVY 
		Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen 
		seventy-five, you know that "neat" went 
		out, I would say, at the turn of the 
		century. 
			(Annie laughs) 
		Who-who are-who are those photos on 
		the wall?

				ANNIE 
			(Moving over to the photographs) 
		Oh ... oh, well, you see now now, uh, 
		that's my dad, that's Father-and that's 
		my ... brother, Duane.

				ALVY 
		Duane?

				ANNIE
			(Pointing) 
		Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is 
		Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.

				ALVY   
		Well, who's Sadie?

				ANNIE  
		Sadie?  Oh, well, Sadie... 
			(Laughing) 
		Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through 
		Grammy's brother George.  Uh, George was 
		real sweet, you know, he had that thing.  
		What is that thing where you, uh, where 
		you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a 
		sentence, you know-what is it?  Uh ...

				ALVY 
		Uh, narcolepsy.

				ANNIE
		Narcolepsy, right, right.  Right.  So, 
		anyway, so ... 
			(Laughing) 
		George, uh, went to the union, see, to 
		get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the 
		union always gave George this big turkey 
		at Christmas time because he was ... 
			(Annie points her fingers to each 
			side of her head, indicating George 
			was a little crazy) 
		shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the 
		First World War. 
			(Laughing hysterically, she opens 
			a cabinet door and takes out a 
			bottle of wine) 
		Anyway, so, so ... 
			(Laughing through the speech) 
		George is standing in line, oh, just a sec 
		...uh, getting his free turkey, but the 
		thing is, he falls asleep and he never 
		wakes up. So, so...
			(Laughing) 
		so, he's dead ... 
			(Laughing) 
		he's dead.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  Well, 
		terrible, huh, wouldn't you say?  I 
		mean, that's pretty unfortunate.

Annie unscrews the bottle of wine, silent now after her speech.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, it's a great story, though, I 
		mean, I... I ... it really made my day.  
		Hey, I think I should get outta here, 
		you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, 
		you know ...

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, really?  Oh, well ... uh, uh, maybe, 
		uh, maybe, we, uh ...

				ALVY 
		... and ... uh, yeah, uh ... uh, you 
		know, I-I-I... 

They move outside to the terrace, Alvy still holding the glasses, Annie the 
wine.  They stand in front of the railing, Annie pouring the wine into the 
held-out glasses.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.

				ALVY
		No, I know, but ... but, you know, I'm 
		all perspired and everything.

				ANNIE 
		Well, didn't you take, uh ... uh, a 
		shower at the club?

				ALVY
		Me?  No, no, no, 'cause I never shower 
		in a public place.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Why not?

				ALVY 
		'Cause I don't like to get naked in front 
		of another man, you know-it's, uh ...

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, I see, I see.

				ALVY 
		You know, I don't like to show my body 
		to a man of my gender-

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I see.  I guess-

				ALVY	
		-'cause, uh, you never know what's 
		gonna happen.

				ANNIE	
			(Sipping her wine and laughing) 
		Fifteen years, huh?

				ALVY
		Fifteen years, yeah.

				ANNIE	
		Yeah.  Oh, God bless!

They	put their glasses together in a toast.

				ALVY
		God bless.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Well, uh ... 
			(Pausing) 
		You're what Grammy Hall would call a 
		real Jew.

				ALVY  
			(Clearing his throat) 
		Oh, thank you.

				ANNIE
			(Smiling) 
		Yeah, well ... you-She hates Jews.  She 
		thinks that they just make money, but let 
		me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, 
		is she ever.  I'm tellin' yuh.

				ALVY 
			(pointing toward the apartment 
			after a short pause) 
		So, did you do shoot the photographs 
		in there or what?

				ANNIE
			(Nodding, her hand on her hip) 
		Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

Annie's thoughts pop on the screen as she talks: I dabble?  Listen to me-what 
a jerk!

				ALVY 
		They're ... they're... they're wonderful, 
		you know.  They have ... they have, uh 
		... a ... a quality.
	
As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl

				ANNIE
		Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take 
		a serious photography course soon.

Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo

				ALVY 
		Photography's interesting, 'cause, you 
		know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, 
		uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have 
		not emerged yet.

And Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked?

				ANNIE 
		Aesthetic criteria?  You mean, whether 
		it's, uh, good photo or not?

I'm not smart enough for him.  Hang in there

				ALVY 
		The-the medium enters in as a condition 
		of the art form itself.  That's-

I don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow

				ANNIE 
		Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, 
		it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you 
		know.  I mean, I just try to uh, feel 
		it, you know?  I try to get a sense of 
		it and not think about it so much.

God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others

				ALVY 
		Still, still we- You need a set of 
		aesthetic guide lines to put it in 
		social perspective, I think.

Christ, I sound like FM radio.  Relax

They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping.  The sounds of 
distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace.  Annie, laughing, 
speaks first.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I don't know.  I mean, I guess-I 
		guess you must be sorta late, huh?

				ALVY 
		You know, I gotta get there and begin 
		whining soon ... otherwise I- Hey ... 
		well, are you busy Friday night?

				ANNIE 
		Me?  Oh, uh.         
			(Laughing) 
		No.

				ALVY 
			(Putting his band on his forehead) 
		Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have 
		something.  Well, what about Saturday 
		night?

				ANNIE 
			(Nodding) 
		Oh ... nothing.  Not-no, no!

				ALVY 
		Oh, you ... you're very popular, I can see.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I know.

				ALVY 
		Gee, boy, what do you have?  You have 
		plague?

				ANNIE	
		Well, I mean, I meet a lot of ... jerks, 
		you know-

				ALVY
		Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.

				ANNIE	
			(Overlapping) 
		-what I mean?

				ALVY	
		I think that's, uh-

				ANNIE
			(Interrupting) 
		But I'm thinking about getting some 
		cats, you know, and then they ... Oh, 
		wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean 
			(Laughing) 
		oh, shoot!  No, Saturday night I'm 
		gonna-
			(Laughing) 
		gonna sing.  Yeah.

				ALVY
		You're gonna sing?  Do you sing?  Well, 
		no, it isn't
			(Overlapping) 
		No kidding? 
			(Overlapping) 
		-this is my first time.  Oh, really?  Where?  
		I'd like to come. 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, no, no, no, no, no!  No, I'm interested!

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning 
		sort of at club.  I don't-

				ALVY
			(Overlapping) 
		No, so help me.

				ANNIE
			(Overlapping) 
		-it's my first time.

				ALVY
		That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what 
		that's like.  Listen-

				ANNIE
			(Interrupting) 
		Yeah.

				ALVY
			(Overlapping) 
		-you're gonna like night clubs, they're 
		really a lotta fun.

INT. NIGHT CLUB-NIGHT

Annie stands on center stage with a microphone, a pianist behind her.  A 
Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness.  There 
are the typical sounds and movements of a nightclub audience: low conversation,
curling smoke, breaking glass, microphone bum, moving chairs, waiters 
clattering trays, a ringing phone as Annie sings "It Had to Be You.

EXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT.

Alvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk. 

				ANNIE 
		I was awful.  I'm so ashamed!  I can't 
		sing. 

				ALVY 
		Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad 
		restless.

				ANNIE 
		Whatta you mean, a tad restless?  Oh, 
		my God, I mean, they hated me.

				ALVY 
		No, they didn't.  You have a wonderful 
		voice.

				ANNIE 
		No, I'm gonna quit!

				ALVY
		No, I'm not gonna letcha.  You have a 
		great voice.

				ANNIE
		Really, do you think so, really?

				ALVY
		Yeah!

				ANNIE
		Yeah?

				ALVY
		It's terrific.

				ANNIE
			(Overlapping) 
		Yeah, you know something?  I never even 
		took a lesson, either.

They stop in the middle of the sidewalk.  Alvy turns Annie around to face him.

				ALVY 
		Hey, listen, listen.

				ANNIE
 			What?

				ALVY
		Gimme a kiss.

				ANNIE
 			Really?

				ALVY
		Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna 
		go home later, right?

				ANNIE
		Yeah.

				ALVY
		And-and uh, there's gonna be all that 
		tension.  You know, we never kissed before 
		and I'll never know when to make the right 
		move or anything.  So we'll kiss now we'll 
		get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?  

				ANNIE
  			Oh, all right.

				ALVY 
		And we'll digest our food better.

				ANNIE
 			Okay.

				ALVY 
		Okay?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

They kiss.

				ALVY 
		So now we can digest our food.  

They turn and start walking again.  

				ANNIE 
		We can digest our-

				ALVY 
		Okay. Yeah.

INT. DELI-NIGHT

Annie and Alvy sit down in a booth.  The deli is fairly well lit and crowded. 
Conversation, plates clattering, can be heard over the dialogue.  The waiter 
comes over to them to take their order.

				ALVY 
			(To the waiter) 
		I'm gonna have a corned beef.

				ANNIE 
			(To the waiter) 
		Yeah ... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a 
		pastrami on white bread with, uh, 
		mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. 
			(Alvy involuntarily makes a face 
			as the waiter leaves) 
		Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you 
		and, uh, were you depressed about that?

				ALVY 
		Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't 
		cure.

				ANNIE 
		Oh.  And your first wife was Allison?

				ALVY 
		My first... Yes, she was nice, but you 
		know, uh, it was my fault.  I was just... 
		I was too crazy.

				ANNIE 
		Oh.

INT. DARKENED BEDROOM-NIGHT

Alvy and Annie in bed together.

				ANNIE
		M'm, that was so nice.  That was nice.

				ALVY
		As Balzac said ...

				ANNIE
 			H'm?

				ALVY
  			"There goes another novel." 
			(They laugh) 
		Jesus, you were great.

				ANNIE
 			Oh, yeah?

				ALVY
 			Yeah.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.

				ANNIE
		No. 
			(She turns and looks at Alvy, 
			then laughs) 
		You're a wreck.

				ALVY
 			Really.  I mean it.  I-I'll never play 
		the piano again.

				ANNIE
 				(Lighting a joint and laughing) 
		You're really nuts.  I don't know, you 
		really thought it was good?  Tell me.

				ALVY
		Good?  I was-

				ANNIE
			(Overlapping) 
		No.

				ALVY
		No, that was the most fun I've ever 
		had without laughing.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Here, you want some?

				ALVY
		No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any 
		major hallucinogenics because I took 
		a puff like five years ago at a party and

				ANNIE
 			Yeah?

				ALVY
 			-tried to take my pants off over my 
		head ... 
			(Annie laughs)
		...  my ear.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I don't know, I don't really.  I 
		don't do it very often, you know, just 
		sort of, er ... relaxes me at first.

				ALVY 
		M'hm. 
			(He pushes himself up from the 
			bed and looks down at Annie)
		You're not gonna believe this, but-

				ANNIE
 			What?  What?

								CUT TO:


INT. BOOKSTORE-DAY

Annie and Alvy browsing in crowded bookstore.  Alvy, carrying two books, 
"Death and Western Thought" and "The Denial of Death", moves over to where 
Annie is looking.

				ALVY
		Hey?

				ANNIE
 			H'm?

				ALVY
 			I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I 
		think, because I-I think you should 
		read them.  You know, instead of that 
		cat book.

				ANNIE
 				(Looking at the books Alvy 
			is bolding) 
		That's, uh ... 
			(Laughing) 
		that's pretty serious stuff there.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, 
		I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, 
		I think.  Big-

				ANNIE
 				(Overlapping) 
		Yeah?

				ALVY
 			-big subject with me, yeah.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah?

They move over to the cashier line.

				ALVY
			(Gesturing) 
		I've a very pessimistic view of life.  
		You should know this about me if we're 
		gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that 
		life is-is divided up into the horrible 
		and the miserable.

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY
		Those are the two categories ...

				ANNIE 
		M'hm.

				ALVY    
		... you know, they're- The-the horrible 
		would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal 
		cases, you know?

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY    
		And blind people, crippled ...

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				ALVY
    			I don't-don't know how they get through 
		life.  It's amazing to me.

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY
 			You know, and the miserable is everyone 
		else.  That's-that's all.  So-so when 
		you go through life you should be thankful 
		that you're miserable, because that's- 
		You're very lucky ... to be ... 
			(Overlapping Annie's laughter) 
		... to be miserable.

				ANNIE
 			U-huh.

EXT. PARK-DAY

It's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park.  People are sitting on benches, 
others strolling, some walking dogs.  One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons.
Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before
them.  An older man and woman walk into view.

				ALVY
		Look, look at that guy.

				ANNIE
 			M'hm.

				ALVY
		There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. 
		When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, 
		you know? 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		He's the latest! just came back from 
		the gin-rummy farm last night. He 
		placed third.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		M'hm.  Yeah.  Yeah.

The camera shows them sitting side by side relaxed on a bench.

				ALVY 
			(Watching two men approach, one 
			lighting a cigar) 
		Look at these guys.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY   
		Oh, that's hilarious.  They're back 
		from Fire Island.  They're ... they're 
		sort of giving it a chance-you know what 
		I mean?

				ANNIE
   			Oh! Italian, right?

				ALVY 
  			Yeah, he's the Mafia.  Linen Supply Business 
		or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Oh, yeah.

				ALVY 
		No, I'm serious. 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		I just got my mustache wet.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah?

				ALVY 
			(As another man walks by) 
		And there's the winner of the Truman 
		Capote look-alike contest.

EXT. STREET-NIGHT

Alvy and Annie walk almost in silhouette along the dock, the New York City 
skyline in the background.  Alvy has his arm around Annie and they walk slowly.
No one else is around.

				ANNIE	
		You see, like you and I ...

				ALVY	
		You are extremely sexy.

				ANNIE	
		No, I'm not.

				ALVY	
		Unbelievably sexy.  Yes, you are.  
		Because ... you know what you are?  
		You're-you're polymorphously perverse.

				ANNIE	
		Well, what does-what does that mean?  
		I don't know what that is.

				ALVY 
		Uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional 
		in bed because you got -you get pleasure 
		in every part of your body when I touch you.

				ANNIE 
		Ooooh!

They stop walking.  Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him.  The 
South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background.

				ALVY 
		You know what I mean?  Like the tip 
		o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth 
		or your kneecaps ... you get excited.

				ANNIE 
		Come on. 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah.  You know what?  You know, I 
		like you, I really mean it.  I really do 
		like you.

				ALVY
		You- Do you love me?

				ANNIE
		Do I love you?

				ALVY
		That's the key question.

				ANNIE
		Yeah.

				ALVY
		I know you've only known me a short 
		while.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I certainly ... I think that's 
		very- Yeah, yeah ... 
			(Laughing) 
		yeah.  Do you love me?

				ALVY
 			I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word 
		for what...

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY
		- I ... I love you. 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you. 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
			(Putting his arms around her neck) 
		Don't you think I do?

				ANNIE
 			I dunno.

They kiss as a foghorn sounds in the distance.

INT. ALVY'S APARTMENT

Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is 
filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures.  They both carry 
cartons.

				ALVY
 			Whatta you mean?  You're not gonna give 
		up your own apartment, are you?

				ANNIE
			(Putting down the carton) 
		Of course.

				ALVY
		Yeah, bu-bu-but why?

				ANNIE
		Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, 
		that's why.

				ALVY
		Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.

				ANNIE
		I have a tiny apartment.

				ALVY
     			Yeah, I know it's small.

				ANNIE 
			(Picking up the suitcases and 
			walking into the bedroom) 
		That's right, and it's got bad plumbing 
		and bugs.

				ALVY
			(Picking up some pictures and 
			following Annie into the bedroom) 
		All right, granted, it has bad plumbing 
		and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a 
		negative thing.  You know, bugs are-are-uh, 
		entomology is a ... 
			(Annie, reacting, tosses the 
			suitcases and some loose clothing 
			onto the bed.  She sits down on the 
			edge, looking away. Alvy walks in, 
			pictures and carton in band, still 
			talking) 
		... rapidly growing field.

				ANNIE
		You don't want me to live with you?

				ALVY 
		How- I don't want you to live with me?  
		How- Whose idea was it?

				ANNIE 
		Mine.

				ALVY 
		Ye-ah.  Was it ... It was yours actually, 
		but, uh, I approved it immediately.

				ANNIE 
		I guess you think that I talked you into 
		something, huh?
			(putting pictures on the mantel) 
		
				ALVY
		No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, 
		we sleep together, we eat together.  Jesus, 
		you don't want it to be like we're married, 
		do yuh?

He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in.  He 
starts tossing books off screen.

				ANNIE
			(Looking up at Alvy) 
		How is it any different?

				ALVY  
			(Gesturing) 
		It's different 'cause you keep your own 
		apartment. 
			(Holding a book, he starts walking 
			around the room) 
		Because you know it's there, we don't 
		have to go to it, we don't have to deal 
		with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating 
		life raft ... that we know that we're not 
		married.

He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat.

				ANNIE  
			(Still sitting on the bed) 
		That little apartment is four hundred 
		dollars a month, Alvy.

				ALVY   
			(Looking at Annie) 
		That place is four hundred dollars a month?

				ANNIE  
		Yes, it is.  

				ALVY 
			(Whistling) 
		It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs.  Jesus, 
		I'll-My accountant will write it off as a 
		tax deduction, I'll pay for it.

				ANNIE 
			(Shaking her head) 
		You don't think I'm smart enough to be 
		serious about.

				ALVY  
		Hey, don't be ridiculous.

Alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie.

				ANNIE  
		Then why are you always pushing me to take 
		those college courses like I was dumb or 
		something?

				ALVY  
			(Putting his hand to his forehead) 
		'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing.  
		You meet a lotta interesting professors.  
		You know, it's stimulating.

EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY

Annie and Alvy, in Annie's VW, driving to their summerhouse.  The camera moves 
with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage.  There 
is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet.  Classical music plays in the 
background.

								CUT TO:

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

Annie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing 
through a school catalogue.  Alvy lies in bed reading.

				ANNIE 
			(Reading) 
		Does this sound like a good course?  
		Uh, "Modern American Poetry"?  Uh, or, 
		uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh, 
		take "Introduction to the Novel."

				ALVY 
		Just don't take any course where they 
		make you read Beowulf.

				ANNIE 
		What? 
			(Laughing) 
		Hey, listen, what-what do you think?  Do 
		you think we should, uh, go to that-that 
		party in Southampton tonight? 

Alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder.

				ALVY 
		No, don't be silly.  What-what do we need 
		other people for? 
			(He puts his arms around her neck, 
			kissing her, Annie making muffled 
			sounds) 
		You know, we should-we should just turn 
		out the lights, you know, and play hide 
		and seek or something.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Well, okay.  Well, listen, I'm gonna get 
		a cigarette, okay?

				ALVY 
			(Yelling out to her as she leaves 
			the room) 
		Yeah, grass, right?  The illusion that 
		it will make a white woman more like 
		Billie Holiday.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		Well, have you ever made love high?

				ALVY
		Me, no.  You ... I-I-you know, if I 
		have grass or alcohol or anything I 
		get unbearably wonderful.  I get too, 
		too wonderful for words.  You know, 
		I don't-I don't know why you have to, 
		uh, get high every time we make love.

				ANNIE 
			(Moving back into the room and 
			lighting a joint) 
		It relaxes me.

				ALVY 
		Oh, you-you have to be artificially 
		relaxed before we can go to bed?

				ANNIE 
			(Closing the door) 
		Well, what's the difference, anyway?

				ALVY 
		Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium 
		pentothal.  You can sleep through it.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, come on, look who's talking.  You've 
		been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. 
			(She gets into bed and takes a 
			puff of marijuana) 
		You should smoke some o' this.  You'd be 
		off the couch in no time.

				ALVY 
		Oh, come, you don't need that.

Alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her.

				ANNIE 
		What are you doing?

				ALVY 
			(Kissing her) 
		No, no, no, what ... You can once, you 
		can live without it once.  Come on.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.
			(Laughing and making sounds) 
		M'mrnm.

				ALVY 
		M'm, wait, I got a great idea. 
			(He gets up and goes over to the 
			closet, taking out a light bulb.  
			He goes back to the bed and turns 
			out the lamp on the night table) 
		Hang in there for a second.  I got a 
		little-little artifact.  A little erotic 
		artifact, that-that I brought up from the 
		city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. 
			(He turns the lamp back on, having 
			replaced the bulb with the red one 
			from the closet) 
		I just ... there ... There's a little Old 
		New Orleans ... essence.  Now-now we can go 
		about our business here and we can even 
		develop photographs if we want to.  There, 
		now there. 
			(He undresses and crawls into bed, 
			taking Annie in his arms) 
		M'mmm.  M'mmm.  Hey, is something wrong?  

				ANNIE

		Uh-uh-why?

				ALVY 
		I don't know.  You- It's like you're-
		you're removed.

				ANNIE 
		No, I'm fine.

As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits 
down on a chair, watching.

				ALVY 
		Really?

				ANNIE 
		U-huh.

				ALVY 
		I don't know, but you seem sort of distant. 

				ANNIE 
		Let's just do it, all right?

				ALVY
			(Kissing and caressing Annie) 
		Is it my imagination or are you just 
		going through the motions?

				ANNIE'S SPIRIT  
		Alvy, do you remember where I put my 
		drawing pad?  Because while you two are 
		doing that, I think I'm gonna do some 
		drawing.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		You see, that's what I call removed.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, you have my body.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, but that's not-that's no good.  
		I want the whole thing. 

				ANNIE 
			(Sighing) 
		Well, I need grass and so do you.

				ALVY 
		Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass 
			(Clearing his throat)
		 because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		-so if I get a laugh from a person who's 
		high, it doesn't count.  You know-'cause 
		they're always laughin'.

				ANNIE 
		Were you always funny?

				ALVY 
		Hey, what is this-an interview?  We're 
		supposed to be making love.

								CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE.

A typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building. 
Autographed 8 X 12 is plastered in the sloppy room.  The agent, chewing a 
cigar, sits behind his desk talking to one of his clients, a comedian, who 
stands with his hands in his pockets.  A young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair 
nearby watching.

				AGENT 
		This guy is naturally funny.  I think 
		he can write for you.

				COMIC 
			(Buttoning his jacket) 
		Yeah, yeah.  Hey, kid, he tells me you're 
		really good.  Well, lemme explain a little 
		bit o' how I work.  You know, you can tell 
		right off the bat that I don't look like 
		a funny guy when I come-you know, like some 
		o' the guys that come out.  You know, right 
		away 
			(Gesturing) 
		they're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're 
		gonna fall down, but I gotta be really 
		talented.  Material's gotta be sensational 
		for me 'cause I work, you know, with very, 
		very ... Come on, I'm kinda classy, you 
		know what I mean?  Uh ... uh ... lemme 
		explain.  For instance, I open with an 
		opening song.  A musical start like 
			(Ad-lib singing) 
		and I walk out 
			(Ad-lib singing)  
		"Place looks wonderful from here and 
		you folks look wonderful from here! 
			(Singing)
		"And seein' you there
		With a smile on your face
		Makes me shout
		This must be the place."
		Then I stop right in the middle and then 
		I open with some jokes.  Now, that's where 
		I need you, right there.  For instance, like 
		I say, "Hey, I just got back from Canada, 
		you know, they speak a lotta French up 
		there.  The only way to remember Jeanne 
		d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom!" 
			(He laughs.  Seated Alvy looks 
			up smiling) 
		"Oh, I met a big lumberjack ..."

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(To himself) 
		Jesus, this guy's pathetic. 

				COMIC 
			(Overlapping above speech) 
		... big lumberjack ...

				ALVY'S VOICE 
			(To himself while the comic 
			continues his routine) 
		Look at him mincing around, like he 
		thinks he's real cute.  You wanna throw 
		up.  If only I had the nerve to do my 
		own jokes.  I don't know how much longer 
		I can keep this smile frozen on my face.  
		I'm in the wrong business, I know it.

				COMIC 
			(Overlapping above speech) 
		"'Cherie, come back.  I love you. 
			(Shaking his lips and mimicking) 
		But, uh, Cheri, what will I do with this, 
		uh?' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you 
		make me so mad."' 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, they scream at that.  Now, write me 
		somethin' like that, will yuh?  Kinda 
		French number, can yuh do it?  Huh, kid?

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering,
excited, as Alvy stands on spotlighted stage holding the microphone.

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		W-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to 
		reorient myself.  This is the University 
		of Wisconsin, right?  So I'm always ... 
		I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a 
		col- I've a very bad history with colleges.  
		You know, I went to New York University and, 
		uh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman 
		year ... for cheating on my metaphysics final.  
		You know, I looked within the soul of the 
		boy sitting next to me- 
			(The audience laughs; they're with him)
		 -and when I was thrown out, my mother, 
		who's an emotionally high-strung woman, 
		locked herself in the bathroom and took an 
		overdose of mah-jongg tiles. 
			(More applause and laughter) 
		And, uh, tsch, I was depressed.  I was ... 
		in analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a 
		matter of fact, uh, I would have killed 
		myself but I was in analysis with a strict 
		Freudian and if you kill yourself ... they 
		make you pay for the sessions you miss.

INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER.

Students mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs.
Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just 
		great, I'm not kidding.  It was- You 
		were so neat.

				ALVY 
		C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know something?  
		I think that I'm starting to get more 
		of your references, too.

				ALVY
		Are yuh?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				ALVY 
		Well, the twelve o'clock show is 
		completely different than the nine.

				YOUNG WOMAN 
			(Interrupting) 
		May I have your autograph?

				ANNIE 
			(Over lapping above speech) 
		Oh.

				ALVY 
			(To Annie, while autographing) 
		You're so sure about it.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to 
		tomorrow.  I mean, you know, I think that 
		it'll be really nice to meet Mother and 
		Father. 

They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a 
flash camera as they walk through the crowd.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately. 
			(To one of his fans) 
		Thank you.

				ANNIE 
		No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think 
		they're gonna hate you at all.  On the 
		contrary, I think-

				ALVY 
		Yeah.

				ANNIE 
		It's Easter.  You know, we'll have a nice 
		dinner, we'll sit down and eat.  I think 
		they're gonna really like you.

EXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY

The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green 
lawn, then cuts to:

INT. DINING ROOM.

Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner.  The sun is pouring through a big 
picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one
end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr.
and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane.

				MOM HALL 
			(Holding her wine glass) 
		It's a nice ham this year, Mom. 

Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.

				ANNIE 
			(Smiling at Duane) 
		Oh, yeah.  Grammy always does such 
		a good job.

				DAD HALL 
			(Chewing) 
		A great sauce.

				ALVY 
		It is. 
			(Smacking his lips) 
		It's dynamite ham.

Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries 
not to notice.

				MOM HALL 
			(To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair) 
		We went over to the swap meet.  Annie, 
		Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.

				ANNIE 
		We really had a good time.

Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and
hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard.

				MOM HALL 
			(Lighting a cigarette and turning 
			to Alvy) 
		Ann tells us that you've been seeing a 
		psychiatrist for fifteen years.

				ALVY 
			(Setting down his glass and coughing) 
		Yes.  I'm making excellent progress.  
		Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, 
		I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning.  Grammy continues to 
stare.

				DAD HALL 
		Duane and I went out to the boat basin.

				DUANE 
		We were caulkin' holes all day.

				DAD HALL 
		Yeah. 
			(Laughing) 
		Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.

				MOM HALL 
		Oh, that Randolph Hunt.  You remember 
		Randy Hunt, Annie.  He was in the choir 
		with you.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yes, yes.

Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera.

				ALVY 
			(To the audience) 
		I can't believe this family. 
			(Making chewing sounds) 
		Annie's mother.  She really's beautiful.  
		And they're talkin' swap meets and boat 
		basins, and the old lady at the end of 
		the table 
			(Pointing to Grammy) 
		is a classic Jew hater.  And, uh, they, 
		they realty look American, you know, 
		very healthy and ... like they never 
		get sick or anything.  Nothing like my 
		family.  You know, the two are like oil 
		and water.

The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father,
aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table.  They eat quickly 
and interrupt one another loudly.  On the left the Halls in their dining room. 
Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed.

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Let 'im drop dead!  Who needs his 
		business?!

				ALVY'S MOTHER 
		His wife has diabetes!

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Di-diabetes?  Is that any excuse?  
		Diabetes?

				ALVY'S UNCLE 
		The man is fifty years old and doesn't 
		have a substantial job.

				ALVY'S AUNT 
			(Putting more meat on her 
			husband's plate) 
		Is that a reason to steal from his father?

				ALVY'S UNCLE 
		Whatta you talkin' about?  You don't 
		know what you're talking about.

				ALVY'S AUNT 
		Yes, I know what I'm talking about.

				ALVY'S MOTHER 
			(Interrupting) 
		George, defend him!

				ALVY'S UNCLE 
			(Over Alvy's father's muttering) 
		No Moskowitz he had a coronary.

				ALVY'S AUNT 
		You don't say.

				ALVY'S MOTHER 
		We fast.

				MOM HALL 
		Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the 
		Veterans Hospital.

				DAD HALL 
		My God, he's the new president of the 
		El Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is 
		somethin' else.

				MOM HALL 
		That's Jack's wife.  We used to make 
		that outta raisins.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yes, that's right.  Did you see 
		the new play?

				MOM HALL 
		Oh, you remember her, Annie.

				ANNIE 
		Yes, I do.

The two families start talking back and forth to one another.  The screen is 
still split.

				MOM HALL 
		How do you plan to spend the holidays, 
		Mrs. Singer?

				DAD HALL 
		Fast?

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Yeah, no food.  You know, we have to 
		atone for our sins.

				MOM HALL 
		What sins?  I don't understand.

				ALVY'S FATHER 
		Tell you the truth, neither do we.

								CUT TO:

INT. DUANE'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door.

				DUANE 
		Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Walking in) 
		Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?

				DUANE 
		This is my room.

				ALVY 
			(Looking around) 
		Oh, yeah? 
			(He clears his throat) 
		Terrific.

				DUANE 
		Can I confess something?

Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser.  Duane's face is 
big lighted by a single lamp.

				DUANE 
		I tell you this because, as an artist, 
		I think you'll understand.  Sometimes 
		when I'm driving ... on the road at night
		... I see two headlights coming toward me.  
		Fast.  I have this sudden impulse to turn 
		the wheel quickly, head-on into the 
		oncoming car.  I can anticipate the 
		explosion.  The sound of shattering glass.  
		The ... flames rising out of the flowing 
		gasoline.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting and clearing his throat) 
		Right.  Tsch, well, I have to-I have 
		t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due 
		back on the planet earth. 

He slowly gets up and moves toward the door.

INT. THE HALLS' LIVING ROOM.

Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them.

				MOM HALL
		Now, don't let it be so long, now.

				ANNIE 
		No.

				DAD HALL 
		And look up Uncle Bill, you promise. 

				ANNIE 
		Okay.  Okay.

				MOM HALL 
		Oh, he's adorable, Annie.

				ANNIE 
		You think so?  Do you really?

				MOM HALL 
		We're going to take them to the airport.
				
				DAD HALL 
		Oh, no-Duane can.  I haven't finished 
		my drink. 

				ANNIE 
		Yes, Duane is.  I'll be right-

				MOM HALL 
		M'mmm.

				ANNIE 
		I just have time to get the, uh-

She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead.  It is raining very hard, the 
windshield wipers are moving quickly.  The headlights of another car brightens 
the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then 
Alvy tensely staring straight ahead.

EXT. STREET- DAY

The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones. 
It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. Annie 
walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right. They walk 
quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		You followed me.  I can't believe it!

				ALVY 
			(Off screen) 
		I didn't follow you!

				ANNIE  
		You followed me!

				ALVY   
		Why?  'Cause I ... was walkin' along 
		a block behind you staring at you?  
		That's not following!

				ANNIE 
		Well, what is your definition of 
		following?

				ALVY 
			(Gasping) 
		Following is different.  I was spying.

				ANNIE 
		Do you realize how paranoid you are?

				ALVY 
		Paranoid?  I'm looking at you.  You 
		got your arms around another guy.

				ANNIE 
		That is the worst kind of paranoia.

				ALVY 
		Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying.  
		I-I thought I'd surprise yuh.  Pick you 
		up after school.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the 
		relationship flexible, remember?  
		It's your phrase.

				ALVY 
		Oh, stop it.  But you were having an 
		affair with your college professor.  
		That jerk that teaches that incredible 
		crap course "Contemporary Crisis in 
		Western Man"!

				ANNIE 
		"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"!  
		You're really close.

				ALVY 
		What's the difference?  It's all mental 
		masturbation.

				ANNIE 
			(Stopping for a moment) 
		Oh, well, now we're finally getting to 
		a subject you know something about!

She walks away.

				ALVY 
			(Catching up to her) 
		Hey, don't knock masturbation!  It's 
		sex with someone I love.

				ANNIE 
			(Continuing to walk quickly) 
		We're not having an affair.  He's married.  
		He just happens to think I'm neat.

				ALVY 
			(Still walking next to her) 
		"Neat"!  There's that- What are you-twelve 
		years old?  That's one o' your Chippewa 
		Falls expressions!  "He thinks I'm neat."

				ANNIE 
		Who cares?  Who cares?

				ALVY
		Next thing you know he'll find you keen
		and peachy, you know?  Next thing you 
		know he's got his hand on your ass!  

They both stop in the middle of the street.

				ANNIE 
		You've always had hostility toward 
		David ever since I mentioned him!

				ALVY 
		David?  You call your teacher David?

				ANNIE 
		It's his name.

				ALVY
 			Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's 
		a biblical name.  Right?  W-What does 
		he call you?  Bathsheba?

He walks away.

				ANNIE 
			(Calling after him) 
		Alvy!  Alvy!  You're the one who never 
		wanted to make a real commitment.  You 
		don't think I'm smart enough!  We had 
		that argument just last month, or don't 
		ou remember that day?

								CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN.

Alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last 
month's argument.  Annie's voice is heard.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		I'm home!

				ALVY 
			(Turning) 
		Oh, yeah?  How'd it go?

				ANNIE 
			(Comes into the kitchen and puts 
			down a bag of groceries on the 
			kitchen table) 
		Oh, it was ... 
			(Laughing) 
		really weird.  But she's a very nice woman.

				ALVY 
		Yeah?

				ANNIE 
		And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, 
		Alvy, she had me sitting up.  So I told her 
		about-about the-the family and about my 
		feelings toward men and about my 
		relationship with my brother.

				ALVY 
		M'm.

				ANNIE 
		And then she mentioned penis envy ... 
		Did you know about that?

				ALVY 
		Me?  I'm-I'm one of the few males who 
		suffers from that, so, so ... you know.

				ANNIE 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
		G-go on, I'm interested.

				ANNIE 
		Well, she said that I was very guilty 
		about my impulses toward marriage, 
		and-and children.

				ALVY 
		M'hm.

				ANNIE 
		And then I remembered when I was a kid 
		how I accidentally saw my parents making 
		love.

				ALVY 
		Tsch.  Rea- All this happened in the 
		first hour?

				ANNIE 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
		That's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been 
		goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, 
		I don't got ... nothing like that in-

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.

				ALVY
		You cried?  I've never once cried.  
		Fantastic ...

				ANNIE
			(Taking groceries from the bag) 
		Yeah.

				ALVY
		I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.

				ANNIE
		In-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank 
		Sinatra is holding his pillow across 
		my face and I can't breathe.

				ALVY 
		Sinatra?

				ANNIE
		Yeah, and he's strangling me ...

				ALVY
		Yeah?

				ANNIE
		... and I keep, you know, it's-

				ALVY 
			(Taking a bottle of juice and 
			some celery from the bag) 
		Well, well, sure ... because he's a 
		singer and you're a singer, you know, 
		so it's perfect.  So you're trying to 
		suffocate yourself.  It-it makes perfect 
		sense.  Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic 
		... kind of insight.

				ANNIE 
			(Pointing her finger at Alvy) 
		She said, your name was Alvy Singer.

				ALVY 
			(Turning to Annie) 
		Whatta you mean?  Me?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah, yeah, yeah, you.  Because in the 
		dream ... I break Sinatra's glasses.

				ALVY 
			(Putting his band to his mouth) 
		Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra 
		had glasses.  So whatta you saying that 
		I-I'm suffocating you?

				ANNIE 
			(Turning, ajar in her hand) 
		Oh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really 
		terrible thing to him.  Because then when 
		he sang it was in this real high-pitched 
		voice.

				ALVY 
			(Thinking) 
		Tsch, what'd the doctor say?

				ANNIE 
			(Putting away some groceries)
		Well, she said that I should probably 
		come five times a week.  And you know 
		something?  I don't think I mind analysis 
		at all.  The only question is, Will it 
		change my wife?

				ALVY 
		Will it change your wife?

				ANNIE 
		Will it change my life?

				ALVY
		Yeah, but you said, "Will it change 
		my wife"!

				ANNIE
		No, I didn't. 
			(Laughing) 
		I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.

				ALVY
		You said, "Will it change. . ." Wife.  
		Will it change ...

				ANNIE
			(Yelling out, angry) 
		Life.  I said, "life."

Alvy turns toward the camera.

				ALVY 
			(To the audience) 
		She said, "Will it change my wife." You 
		heard that because you were there so I'm 
		not crazy.

				ANNIE
 			And, Alvy ... and then I told her about 
		how I didn't think you'd ever really take 
		me seriously, because you don't think that 
		I'm smart enough.

She walks out of the room.

				ALVY
 				(To Annie's back, gesturing) 
		Why do you always bring that up?  Because 
		I encourage you to take adult-education 
		courses?  I think it's a wonderful thing.  
		You meet wonderful, interesting professors'.

								CUT TO:

EXT. STREET

Annie stands at the open door of a cab, Alvy next to her gesturing as people 
and cars move by.

				ALVY 
		Adult education is such junk!  The 
		professors are so phony.  How can you 
		do it?

				ANNIE 
		A bit rapidly.  I don't care what you 
		say about David, he's a perfectly fine 
		teacher!

				ALVY 
			(Interrupting) 
		David!  David!  I can't believe this! 
 
				ANNIE 
		And what are you doing following me 
		around for, anyway?
  
				ALVY 
		I'm following you and David, if you-

				ANNIE  
			(Interrupting) 
		I just think we oughta call this 
		relationship quits! 

Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door.

ALVY
 			That's fine.  That's fine.  That's great! 
			(He turns toward the camera as the 
			cab drives away) 
		Well, I don't know what I did wrong. 
			(Gesturing) 
		I mean, I can't believe this.  Somewhere 
		she cooled off to me! 
			(He walks up to an older woman 
			walking down the street carrying 
			groceries) 
		Is it-is it something that I did?

WOMAN ON THE STREET 
		Never something you do.  That's how 
		people are. Love fades.

She moves on down the street.

ALVY
 				(Scratching his head) 
		Love fades.  God, that's a depressing
		thought. Have to ask you a question. 
			(He stops another passer-by,a man) 
		Don't go any further.  Now, with your 
		wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind 
		o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana?

				MAN ON THE STREET 
		We use a large vibrating egg.

He walks on.

				ALVY 
			(Continuing to walk) 
		Large vibrating egg.  Well, I ask a 
		psychopath, I get that kind of an answer.  
		Jesus, I-I, uh, here ... 
			(He moves up the sidewalk to 
			a young trendy-looking couple, 
			arms wrapped around each other) 
		You-you look like a really happy couple.  
		Uh, uh ... are you?

				YOUNG WOMAN
 			Yeah.

				ALVY
 			Yeah!  So ... so h-h-how do you account 
		for it?

				YOUNG WOMAN 
		Uh, I'm very shallow and empty and I 
		have no ideas and nothing interesting 
		to say.

				YOUNG MAN 
		And I'm exactly the same way.

				ALVY 
		I see.  Well, that's very interesting.  
		So you've managed to work out something, huh?

				YOUNG MAN 
		Right.

				YOUNG WOMAN
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
		Oh, well, thanks very much for talking 
		to me.

He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A 
mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if 
to speak.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		You know, even as a kid I always went 
		for the wrong women.  I think that's my 
		problem.  When my mother took me to see 
		Snow White, everyone fell in love with 
		Snow White.  I immediately fell for the 
		Wicked Queen.

The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs.  The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her 
mirror.  Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of 
him.

				WICKED QUEEN 
		We never have any fun anymore.

				CARTOON FIGURE ALVY 
		How can you say that?

				WICKED QUEEN 
		Why not?  You're always leaning on me
	 	to improve myself.

				CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
 			You're just upset.  You must be getting 
		your period.

				WICKED QUEEN
 			I don't get a period!  I'm a cartoon 
		character.  Can't I be upset once in 
		a while?

Rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked 
Queen.

				CARTOON FIGURE ROB   
		Max, will you forget about Annie?  I 
		know lots of women you can date.

				CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
 			I don't wanna go out with any other women.

				CARTOON FIGURE ROB   
		Max, have I got a girl for you.  You are
		going to love her.  She's a reporter-

The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen 
dissolves into the interior of a concert ball.  Rob's voice carries over from 
the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter.  It's very
crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his 
hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.

				CARTOON FIGURE ROB'S VOICE-OVER 
		-for Rolling Stone.

				FEMALE REPORTER
 			I think there are more people here to 
		see the Maharishi than there were to see 
		the Dylan concert.  I covered the Dylan 
		concert ... which gave me chills.  
		Especially when he sang "She takes just 
		like a woman And she makes love just 
		like a woman Yes, she does And she aches 
		just like a woman But she breaks just 
		like a little girl." 
			(They move toward the aisles as 
			a guard holds up his hands to stop 
			them) 
		Up to that I guess the most charismatic 
		event I covered was Mick's Birthday when 
    			the Stones played Madison Square Garden.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		Man, that's great.  That's just great.

				REPORTER 
		You catch Dylan?

				ALVY 
			(Coughing) 
		Me?  No, no. I-I couldn't make it that 
		ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.

				REPORTER 
		You have a raccoon?

				ALVY 
			(Gesturing) 
		Tsch, a few.

				REPORTER
 			The only word for this is trans-plendid.  
		It's trans-plendid. 

				ALVY 
		I can think of another word.

				REPORTER
 			He's God!  I mean, this man is God!  He's 
		got millions of followers who would crawl 
		all the way across the world just to touch 
		the hem of his garment.

				ALVY 
		Really?  It must be a tremendous hem.

				REPORTER 
		I'm a Rosicrucian myself.

				ALVY 
		Are you?

				REPORTER
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
		I can't get with any religion that 
		advertises in Popular Mechanics.  Look- 
			(The Maharisbi, a small, chunky 
			man, walks out of the men's room, 
			huge bodyguards flanking him while 
			policemen bold back the crowds)
		there's God coming outta the men's room.

				REPORTER
 			It's unbelievably trans-plendid!  I was 
		at the Stones concert in Altamount when 
		they killed that guy, remember?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, were yuh?  I was-I was at an Alice 
		Cooper thing where six people were rushed 
		to the hospital with bad vibes.

INT. ALVY'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

The reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand.  Alvy, lying
next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses.

				REPORTER
 				(Looking down at him) 
		I hope you don't mind that I took so long 
		to finish.

				ALVY
 				(Sighing) 
		Oh, no, no, don't be ... tsch ... don't 
		be silly.  You know, 
			(Yawning) 
		I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some 
		feeling back in my jaw now.

				REPORTER
 			Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque 
		experience.

				ALVY 
		Oh, tsch, thank you.  H'm.

				REPORTER
 			I mean that as a compliment.

				ALVY  
			(Making sounds) 
		I think-I think there's too much burden 
		placed on the orgasm, you know, to make 
		up for empty areas in life.

				REPORTER
 			Who said that?

				ALVY 
			(Rubbing his chin and shoulder) 
		Uh, oh, I don't know.  It might have 
		been Leopold and Loeb. 
			(The telephone rings.  Alvy picks 
			it up, rising up slightly from the 
			bed, concerned, as he talks) 
		Hello.  Oh, hi ... Uh, no, what-what's 
		the matter?  What-what-what?  You sound 
		terrible ... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh
		-what kind of an emergency? ... No, well, 
		stay there.  Stay there, I'll come over 
		right now.  I'll come over right now.  Just 
		stay there, I'll come right over.

He hangs up.  The reporter sits in bed still, taking in the situation.

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY

Annie, looking slightly distraught, goes to open the door to Alvy's knock.

				ALVY 
		What's- It's me, open up.

				ANNIE
 				(Opening the door) 
		Oh.

				ALVY
 			Are you okay?  What's the matter? 
			(They look at each other, Annie 
			sighing) 
		Are you all right?  What-

				ANNIE
 			There's a spider in the bathroom.

				ALVY  
			(Reacting) 
		What?

				ANNIE 
		There's a big black spider in the bathroom.

				ALVY
 			That's what you got me here for at three 
		o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a 
		spider in the bathroom?

				ANNIE
 			My God, I mean, you know how I am about 
		insects.
 
				ALVY
 				(Interrupting, sighing) 
		Oooh.

				ANNIE
		-I can't sleep with a live thing crawling 
		around in the bathroom.

				ALVY
 			Kill it!  For Go- What's wrong with you?  
		Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?

				ANNIE
 				(Shaking her head) 
		No.

Alvy, disgusted, starts waving his hands and starts to move into the living 
room.

				ALVY
 				(Sighing) 
		I told you a thousand times you should 
		always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray.  
		You never know who's gonna crawl over.

				ANNIE 
			(Following him) 
		I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and 
		a fire extinguisher.

				ALVY
		Jesus.  All right, gimme a magazine.  
		I- 'cause I'm a little tired. 
			(While Annie goes of to find 
			him a magazine, Alvy, still 
			talking, glances around the 
			apartment.  He notices a small 
			book on a cabinet and picks it up.) 
		You know, you, you joke with-about me, 
		you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for 
		anything.  An emergency, a tidal wave, 
		an earthquake.  Hey, what is this?  
		What?  Did you go to a rock concert?

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

				ALVY 
		Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd 
		you like it?  Was it-was it, I mean, 
		did it ... was it heavy?  Did it achieve 
		total heavy-ocity?  Or was it, uh...

				ANNIE
 			It was just great!

				ALVY
 				(Thumbing through the book) 
		Oh, humdinger.  When- Well, I got a 
		wonderful idea.  Why don'tcha get the 
		guy who took you to the rock concert, 
		we'll call him and he can come over and 
		kill the spider.  You know, it's a-

He tosses the book down on the cabinet.

				ANNIE 
 			I called you; you wanna help me ... or 
		not?  H'h?  Here. 

She hands him a magazine.

				ALVY
 				(Looking down at the magazine) 
		What is this?  What are you, since 
		when do you read the "National Review"?  
		What are you turning in to?

				ANNIE
 				(Turning to a nearby chair for 
			some gum in her pocketbook) 
		Well, I like to try to get all points 
		of view.

				ALVY 
		It's wonderful.  Then why don'tcha get 
		William F. Buckley to kill the spider?

				ANNIE
 			(Spinning around to face him) 
		Alvy, you're a little hostile, you 
		know that?  Not only that, you look 
		thin and tired.

She puts a piece of gum in her mouth.

				ALVY
  			Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock 
		in the morning.  You, uh, you got me 
		outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't 
		get a taxi cab.  You said it was an 
		emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up 
		the stairs.  Hell - I was a lot more 
		attractive when the evening began.  
		Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you 
		going with a right-wing rock-and roll 
		star?  Is that possible?

				ANNIE
 				(Sitting down on a chair arm 
			and looking up at Alvy) 
		Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

				ALVY
 			Hey, what am I-your son?  Whatta you mean?
		I-I came over TV --_

				ANNIE
 				(Touching his chest with her hand) 
		I got the good chocolate, Alvy.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, where is the spider?

				ANNIE
 			It really is lovely.  It's in the bathroom.

				ALVY
 			Is he in the bathroom?

				ANNIE 
			(Rising from chair) 
		Hey, don't squish it, and after it's 
		dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? 
		And flush it a couple o' times.

				ALVY
 				(Moving down the hallway to 
			the bathroom) 
		Darling, darling, I've been killing 
		spiders since I was thirty, okay?

				ANNIE
 				(Upset, hands on her neck) 
		Oh.  What?

				ALVY 
			(Coming back into the living room) 
		Very big spider.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah?

				ALVY
 			Two ... Yeah.  Lotta, lotta trouble. 
		There's two of 'em. 

Alvy starts walking down the ball again, Annie following.

				ANNIE
 			Two?

				ALVY
  				(Opening a closet door) 
		Yep.  I didn't think it was that big, 
		but it's a major spider.  You got a 
		broom or something with a-

				ANNIE 
		Oh, I-I left it at your house.

				ALVY
 				(Overlapping) 
		-snow shovel or anything or something.

				ANNIE
 				(Overlapping) 
		I think I left it there, I'm sorry.

Reaching up into the closet, Alvy takes out a covered tennis racquet.

				ALVY
 				(Holding the racquet) 
		Okay, let me have this.

				ANNIE
 			Well, what are you doing ... what are 
		you doing with-

				ALVY
 			Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom 
		the size of a Buick.

He walks into the bathroom, Annie looking after him.

				ANNIE
 			Well, okay.  Oooh.

Alvy stands in the middle of the bathroom, tennis racquet in one band, rolled
magazine in the other.  He looks over at the shelf above the sink and picks up 
a small container.  He holds it out, shouting off screen to Annie.

				ALVY 
		Hey, what is this?  You got black soap?
  
				ANNIE
 				(Off screen) 
		It's for my complexion.

				ALVY
 			Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show?  
		Geez. 
			(Alvy turns and starts swapping 
			the racquet over the shelf, knocking 
			down articles and breaking glass) 
		Don't worry! 
			(He continues to swat the racquet 
			all over the bathroom.  He finally 
			moves out of the room, hands close 
			to his body.  He walks into the 
			other room, where Annie is sitting 
			in a corner of her bed leaning against 
			the wall) 
		I did it!  I killed them both.  What-what's 
		the matter?  Whatta you- 
			(Annie is sobbing, her band over 
			her face)
		-whatta you sad about?  You- What'd you 
		want me to do?  Capture 'em and rehabilitate 
		'em?

				ANNIE
 				(Sobbing and taking Alvy's arm) 
		Oh, don't go, okay?  Please.
	
				ALVY
 				(Sitting down next to her) 
		Whatta you mean, don't go?  Whatta-whatta
		-what's the matter?  Whatta you expecting
		-termites?  What's the matter?

				ANNIE
 				(Sobbing) 
		Oh, uh, I don't know.  I miss you.  Tsch.

She beats her fist on the bed.  Reacting, Alvy puts his arm around her shoulder
and leans back against the wall.

				ALVY
 			Oh, Jesus, really?

				ANNIE
 				(Leaning on his shoulder) 
		Oh, yeah.  Oh. 
			(They kiss) 
		Oh!  Alvy?

				ALVY 
		What?

He touches her face gently as she wipes tears from her face.

				ANNIE
 			Was there somebody in your room when 
		I called you?

				ALVY
 			W-w-whatta you mean?

				ANNIE
 			I mean was there another- I thought I 
		heard a voice.

				ALVY
		Oh, I had the radio on.

				ANNIE
		Yeah?

				ALVY
		I'm sorry.  I had the television set 
		... I had the television-

				ANNIE
		Yeah.

Alvy pulls her to him and they kiss again.

								CUT TO:

INT. ALVY'S BED

Alvy is lying in bed next to Annie, who is leaning on her elbow looking down 
at him.  He rubs her arms and she smiles.

				ANNIE
 			Alvy, let's never break up again.  I don't 
		wanna be apart.

				ALVY 
		Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too 
		mature for something like that.

				ANNIE
 			Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?

				ALVY
 			It's all right for me, it's been terrific, 
		you know?  Better than either one of my 
		marriages.  See, 'cause. . . 'cause there's 
		just something different about you.  I 
		don't know what it is, but it's great.

				ANNIE 
			(Snickering) 
		You know I think that if you let me, maybe 
		I could help you have more fun, you know?  
		I mean, I know it's hard and ... Yeah.

				ALVY 
		I don't know.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, what about ... what if we go away 
		this weekend, and we could-

				ALVY
 			Tsch, why don't we get ... why don't 
		we get Rob, and the three of us'll 
		drive into Brooklyn, you know, and 
		we show you the old neighborhood.

				ANNIE
 			Okay, okay.  Okay.

				ALVY
 			That'd be fun for yuh.  Don't you think-

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.

Alvy raises up his head and they kiss.

EXT. HIGHWAY

Annie is behind the wheel in her VW, Rob is beside her, Alvy in the back seat
leaning forward so that his head is between them.  They're driving down the 
highway.

				ANNIE
 			-me, my God, it's a great day!

				ALVY 
			(Interrupting) 
		Hey, can yuh watch the road?  Watch the --
 
				ROB
 				(Overlapping) 
		Yeah, watch the road!

				ALVY 
		You'll total the whole car.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Hey, you know, I never even visited 
		Brooklyn before.

				ROB
 			I can't wait to see the old neighborhood.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.

				ROB
 			We can show her the schoolyard.

				ALVY
 			Right.  I was a great athlete.  Tell 
		her, Max, I was the best, I was all 
		schoolyard.

				ROB 
		Yes, I remember. 
			(Annie laughs) 
		He was all schoolyard.  They threw him 
		a football once, he tried to dribble it.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK.

Alvy Annie and Rob move toward the roller coaster on the screen.  The area's 
deserted.  Sea gulls are heard.

				ALVY 
		Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's
		-that's my old house.  That's where I 
		used to live.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Holy cow!

				ROB
 			You're lucky, Max-where I used to live 
		is now a pornographic equipment store.

Annie laughs.

				ALVY 
		I have some very good memories there.

				ROB
 			What kind of good memories, Max?  
		Your mother and father fighting all 
		the time.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, and always over the most 
		ridiculous things.

FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S HOUSE.

Alvy's father sits in his chair.  His mother is polishing a door while Alvy 
lies on the floor playing.  Annie, adult Alvy and Rob quietly walk into the 
scene to watch.

				ALVY'S FATHER
		You fired the cleaning woman?

				ALVY'S MOTHER
		She was stealing.

				ALVY'S FATHER
		But she's colored.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			SO?

				ALVY'S FATHER
		So the colored have enough trouble.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
		She was going through my pocketbook!

				ALVY'S FATHER
		They're persecuted enough!

				ALVY'S MOTHER
		Who's persecuting?  She stole!

Alvy's father gets up and gets his hard hat.  He sits back down and starts 
polishing it.

				ALVY'S FATHER
 			All right-so we can afford it.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			How can we afford it?  On your pay?  
		What if she steals more?

				ALVY'S FATHER
 			She's a colored woman, from Harlem!  
		She has no money!  She's got a right 
		to steal from us!  After all, who is 
		she gonna steal from if not us?

				ADULT ALVY
 				(Yelling into the scene) 
		You're both crazy!  

				ROB
 			They can't hear you, Max.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			Leo ... I married a fool!

				ROB
			(Pointing) 
		Hey, Max!  Who's that?

As the three friends watch Alvy's old living room, the scene has suddenly 
shifted.  A huge crowd stands around the room, laughing, eating, chatting and 
vibrating with the turns of the roller-coaster ride.

				ALVY
 			It-it-it's the welcome-home party 
		in nineteen forty-five, for my cousin 
		Herbie.

				ADULT ALVY
 				(Pointing) 
		Look, look, there's-there's that one 
		over there, that's Joey Nichols, he 
		was my- 
			(Young Alvy stands next to Joey 
			Nichols, who's sitting in one of 
			the easy chairs.  They smile at 
			each other; people and noise all 
			around)
		-father's friend.  He was always bothering 
		me when I was a kid.

				JOEY
 			Joey Nichols. 
			(Laughing) 
		See.  Nichols.  See, Nichols! 
			(Joey shows young Alvy his cuff 
			links and a tie pin, which are 
			made from nickels, as Alvy stands
			with hands on hips, unconcerned.  
			Joey then slaps his band to his 
			forehead and puts a nickel on 
			his forehead) 
		Yuh see, nickels!  You can always 
		remember my name, just think of Joey 
		Five Cents. 
			(Laughing) 
		That's me.  Joey Five Cents!

Joey grabs Alvy's cheeks and pinches them.

				YOUNG ALVY
 				(Turning away) 
		What an asshole!

A group of women stands near a buffet table eating and listening to Alvy 
mother and her sister, Tessie, and a young girl, as the three friends watch.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 			I was always the sister with good common 
		sense.  But Tessie was always the one 
		with personality.  When she was younger, 
		they all wanted to marry Tessie.

She touches Tessie's shoulder.  Tessie starts to laugh.

				ADULT ALVY
 				(Pointing, to Rob) 
		Do you believe that, Max?  Tessie 
		Moskowitz had the personality.  She's 
		the life of the ghetto, no doubt.

				ALVY'S MOTHER
 				(To the young girl) 
		She was once a great beauty.

Tessie nods her head "yes."

				ROB 
		Tessie, they say you were the sister 
		with personality.

				TESSIE
 				(Addressing the young girl) 
		I was a great beauty.

				ROB
 			Uh, how did this personality come about?

				TESSIE
 				(Grabbing the young girl's cheek) 
		I was very charming.

				ROB
 			There were many men interested in you?

				TESSIE
 				(To the young girl) 
		Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

Tessie gyrates back and forth imitating a dancer while Annie and the adult 
Alvy lean on each other laughing.

				ROB
 				(Laughing) 
		That's pretty hard to believe.

EXT. STREET.

Alvy and Annie walk contentedly down a street; Alvy's arm is draped around 
Annie.  People walk by them on the street as they move toward their apartment
building.

				ANNIE
 			Well, I had a really good day, you know 
		that?  It was just a real fine way to 
		spend my birthday.

				ALVY 
		Ah?  Oh, well, your birthday's not till 
		tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah, but it's real close.

				ALVY
 			Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Oh, darn it.

INT. APARTMENT

Annie and Alvy sit on the sofa.  Annie's unwrapping a gift while Alvy watches.

				ANNIE
 				(Making sounds) 
		This is-
			(Making sounds)
		Huh?

She pulls out flimsy black lingerie from the box.

				ALVY
		Happy birthday.

				ANNIE
		What is this? Is this a...Present?
			(Laughing)
		Are you kidding?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?

				ANNIE 
		Uh, yeah, uh ... t-t-this is more like 
		a present for you, yeah, but it's-

				ALVY 
		Try it ... it'll add years to our 
		sex life.

				ANNIE
 				(Looking up at Alvy and laughing) 
		Uh huh.  Yeah.  Forget it. 

Alvy leans over and hands her another box as she puts down the lingerie.

				ALVY 
		Here's a real present.

				ANNIE
 				(Opening the gift) 
		What... huh?

				ALVY  
		Check it out.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, yeah?  What is this, anyway?
			(continuing) 
		Let me see.  Okay, let's... oooh, God! 
			(She takes out a watch from the box) 
		Oh, you knew I wanted this ... 
			(Laughing) 
		God, it's terrific, God!

				ALVY
 				(Making sounds) 
		Yeah, I know.  Just-just put on the 
		watch, and-and ... that thing, and 
		we'll just ...

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Oh!  My God! 
			(Making sounds)

Alvy kisses Annie.

INT. NIGHT CLUB.

Annie, spotlighted onstage, stands in front of the microphone, smiling.  She 
looks downward and sings "Seems Like Old Times.  " The audience applauds 
loudly as the music fades out.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Thank you.

Alvy sits at the bar, clapping and staring at Annie as she walks over to him 
and sits down.  The low murmur of the night club is surrounding them.

				ALVY
 				(Reacting) 
		You were-you were sensational.  I mean, 
		I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck 
		to it, you would be great, and-and, you 
		know, I-I-you-you were sensational.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking at Alvy, smiling) 
		Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were 
		just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, 
		it makes it really easy for me, because I 
		can be ... huh?

Tony, a famous record personality, pushes through the crowd, moving toward 
Alvy and Annie.  An entourage follows him as he makes his way to their table. 

TONY 
		Excuse me.

He shakes hands with Annie, smiling.

				ANNIE 
 			Oh.

				TONY 
		Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.

				ANNIE
 			Well, hi!

				TONY
		Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say 
		that we really enjoyed your sets.

				ANNIE
			(Laughing) 
		Oh, yeah, really, oh!

				TONY
		I though it was ... very musical, and I 
		liked it a lot.

				ANNIE
 			Oh, neat ... oh, that's very nice, 
		gosh, thanks a lot.

				TONY 
		Are you ... are you recording?  Or do- 
		Are you with any label now?

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		No, no, no, not at all.

				TONY  
 			Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about 
		that sometime, if you get a chance.

Seated Alvy looks the other way, reacting.

				ANNIE 
		Oh.  What about?

				TONY   
		... of possibly working together.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking for the first time at Alvy) 
		Well, hey, that's, that's nice.  Uh. 
		Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer.  
		Do you know Alvy?  Uh ... and ... uh ... 
		Tony Lacey.

				TONY
 			No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know 
		your work.  I'm a big fan of yours.

Tony reaches over and shakes hands with Alvy.  The nightclub crowd surrounds 
them all with their low chatter and cigarette smoke.

				ALVY 
		Thank you very much.  It's a pleasure.

				TONY
 				(Turning to introduce his entourage) 
		This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh ... Bob and 
		Petronia.

				ANNIE
 			Hi.

				ENTOURAGE 
		Hi.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		Hi, hi, Bob ...

				TONY 
		Uh ... w-we're going back to the Pierre.  
		We're staying at the Pierre ... and we're 
		gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a 
		drink there, and ... if you'd like to come, 
		uh, we'd love to have you.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY
 			And we could just sit and talk ... nothing.  
		Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just 
		be very mellow.

Annie and Tony and his entourage turn to look at Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Fingers to his mouth, reacting) 
		Remember, we had that thing.

				ANNIE
 			What thing?

				ALVY
 				(Staring at Annie and clearing 
			his throat) 
		Don't you remember we-we-we discussed 
		that thing that we were-

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Thing?

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping) 
		-yes, we had, uh ...

				ANNIE 
			(Looking at Alvy, reacting) 
		Oh, the thing!  Oh, the thing ... 
			(Laughing) 
		... yeah ... yeah.

Annie turns, looks at Tony as he smiles and gestures with his hands.

				TONY 
		Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, 
		we can't do it now ... that's fine, 
		too.  W-w-w-we'll do it another time.

				ANNIE
 			Hey-

				TONY 
		Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get 
		together and ... and we'll meet there.

He shakes hands with Annie.

				ANNIE 
			(Reacting) 
		Oh.

				TONY
 			It was a wonderful set.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, gosh.

				TONY 
			(Smiling) 
		I really enjoyed it. 
			(Looking at Alvy) 
		Nice to have metcha.  Good night.

				ENTOURAGE 
		Bye-bye.

				ANNIE 
		Nice to see you ... bye.  Yeah.  Bye. 

She turns and looks at Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		What's ... you ... well, what's the 
		matter, You w-wanna go to that party?

				ANNIE 
			(Looking down at her hands, 
			then up at Alvy) 
		I don't know, I thought it might be kind 
		of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be 
		nice to meet some new people.

				ALVY
 				(Sighing) 
		I'm just not ... you know, I don't think 
		I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I 
		don't respond well to mellow, you know 
		what I mean, I-I have a tendency to ... 
		if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then 
		rot.  You know, and it's-it's not good 
		for my ... 
			(Making sounds)

				ANNIE 
		All right, all right, you don't wanna go 
		to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?

INT. MOVIE THEATER.

The screen is projecting the beginning of "The Sorrow and the Pity": a street 
filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats. 
Subtitles pop on:

"The Jewish warmongers and
Parisian plutocrats tried
to flee with their gold and jewels"

as a narrator explains in German.

								CUT TO.

Split screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the 
right. Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor.  
The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. Alvy, talking to his 
psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him.  
This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood.
The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously.

				ANNIE
 				(To her doctor) 
		That day in Brooklyn was the last day 
		I remember really having a great time.

				ALVY 
			(To his doctor) 
		Well, we never have any laughs anymore, 
		is the problem.

				ANNIE 
		Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.

				ALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST
 			How often do you sleep together?

				ANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST 
		Do you have sex often?

				ALVY 
		Hardly ever.  Maybe three times a week.

				ANNIE 
		Constantly!  I'd say three times a week.  
		Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have 
		sex.

				ALVY 
		She would not sleep with me the other 
		night, you know, it's-

				ANNIE 
		And ... I don't know ... I mean, six months 
		ago I-I woulda done it.  I woulda done it, 
		just to please him.

				ALVY 
		I mean ... I tried everything, you know, 
		I-I-I put on soft music and my-my red light 
		bulb, and ...

				ANNIE
 			But the thing is-I mean, since our 
		discussions here, I feel I have a right 
		to my own feelings.  I think you woulda 
		been happy because ... uh, uh, I really 
		asserted myself.

				ALVY 
		The incredible thing about it is, I'm 
		paying for her analysis and she's making 
		progress and I'm getting screwed.

				ANNIE 
		I don't know, though, I feel so guilty 
		because Alvy is paying for it, so, you 
		know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go 
		to bed with him.  But if I do go to bed 
		with him, it's like I'm going against my 
		own feelings.  I don't know I-I can't win.

				ALVY 
			(Simultaneously, with Annie) 
		You know ... it's getting expensive
		...my analyst ... for her analyst.  She-
		she's making progress and I'm not making 
		any progress.  Her progress is defeating 
		my progress.

				ANNIE
			(Simultaneously, with Alvy) 
		Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I 
		should just live with a woman.

								CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT

Alvy and Annie sit close together on the sofa in some friends' apartment. 
Their friends, another couple, stand behind the sofa in the background. 
Excited, they talk almost all at once.

				WOMAN FRIEND 
		Wow, I don't believe it ... you mean to 
		tell me you guys have never snorted coke?

				ANNIE 
		Well, I always wanted to try, you know, 
		but, uh, Alvy, uh ... he's very down on it.

				ALVY 
		Hey, don't put it on me.  You kn- Wh-what 
		is it, I don't wanna put a wad of white 
		powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal 
		membranes ...

They all start talking at once.

				ANNIE 
		You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.

				ALVY 
			(Counting on his fingers) 
		How can you say that?  I mean, 
			(Making sounds) 
		who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that 
		girl from your acting class should sleep 
		together in a threesome.

				ANNIE 
			(Reacting) 
		That's sick!

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new.  
		You know, you didn't say it couldn't be 
		sick.

Annie laughs, chatters.

				WOMAN FRIEND 
		Just come on, Alvy. 
			(All four are now sitting on the 
			sofa. The male friend starts to 
			prepare lines of cocaine; Alvy 
			and Annie look at each other, 
			reacting) 
		Do your body a favor.  Try it, come on.

				ALVY 
		Oh, yeah?

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.  Come on.  It'd be fun.

				ALVY 
			(Moving forward on the couch) 
		Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause 
		the Incas did it, you know, and-and 
		they-they-they were a million laughs.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Alvy, come on, for your own experience.  
		I mean, you wanna write, why not?

				MALE FRIEND 
		It's great stuff, Alvy.  Friend of mine 
		just brought it in from California.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, do you know something-I didn't tell 
		yuh, we're going to California next week.

				GIRL 
		Oh, really?

				ANNIE 
		Yeah ...

				ALVY  
 			... I'm thrilled.  As you know, uh ... 
		uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, 
		and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

				ANNIE 
			(Interrupting) 
		No, no, no that's not it at all.  Alvy's 
		giving an award on television.  Gee, he 
		talks like he's violating a moral issue 
		sitting here.

				GIRL 
		You're kidding?

				ALVY 
		It's so phony, and we have to leave New 
		York during Christmas week, which really 
		kills me.

				MAN 
			(Interrupting) 
		Alvy, listen, while you're in California, 
		could you possibly score some coke for me?

Annie laughs.

				ALVY 
			(Over Annie's laughter) 
		Sure, sure, I'll be glad to. I-I'll just 
		put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that I 
		have in my boot, you know. 
			(Alvy picks up the small open 
			gold case of cocaine base the man 
			placed on the coffee table and
			looks at it, reacting) 
		H-h-how much is this stuff?

				MAN 
		It's about two thousand dollars an ounce.

				ANNIE 
		God.

				ALVY
 			Really?  And what is the kick of it?  
		Because I never ...

He puts his finger into the drug, smells it and then sneezes.  The powder 
blows all over the room as the man, woman and Annie react silently.

								CUT TO:


CALIFORNIA. BEVERLY HILLS STREET-DAY

It's a warm, beautiful day.  Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's convertible are 
moving past the spacious houses, the palm trees.  The sunlight reflects off 
the car.  Annie, excited, is taking the whole place in.  Background voices 
sing Christmas carols.

				VOICES
			(Singing) 
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		We wish you a Merry Christmas, 
		We wish you a Merry Christmas, 
		And a -Happy New Year.

				ROB 
			(Over the singing) 
		I've never been so relaxed as I have 
		been since I moved out here, Max.  I 
		want you to see my house.  I live 
		right next to Hugh Hefner's house, Max.  
		He lets me use the Jacuzzi.  And the 
		women, Max, they're like the women in 
		Playboy magazine, only they can move 
		their arms and legs.

				ANNIE
 				(Laughing) 
		You know, I can't get over that this is 
		really Beverly Hills.

				VOICES 
			(Singing) 
		We wish you a Merry Christmas,
		And a Happy New Year.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, the architecture is really consistent, 
		isn't it?  French next to-

				VOICES 
			(Singing over the dialogue)
		Oh, Christmas ... tree,
		Oh, Christmas tree,
		How bright and green
		Our ...

				ALVY
		-Spanish, next to Tudor, next to Japanese.

				ANNIE 
		God, it's so clean out here.

				ALVY 
		It's that they don't throw their garbage 
		away.  They make it into television shows.

				ROB 
		Aw, come on, Max, give us a break, will 
		yuh?  It's Christmas. 

Annie starts snapping pictures of the view.

				ALVY 
		Can you believe this is Christmas here?

				VOICES 
			(Singing) 
		Oh Christmas tree,
		Oh Christmas tree ...

They pass a large house with spacious lawn.  Sitting on the lawn is a Santa 
Claus complete with sleigh and reindeer.  Voices continue to sing Christmas 
carols; Annie continues to take pictures.

				ANNIE
		You know, it was snowing-it was snowing 
		and really gray in New York yesterday.

				ROB 
		No kidding?

				ALVY 
		Right-well, Santa Claus will have 
		sunstroke.

				ROB 
		Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.

				ALVY 
		There's no economic crime, you know, 
		but there's-there's ritual, religious-
		cult murders, you know, there's wheat-
		germ killers out here.

				ROB 
		While you're out here, Max, I want you 
		to see some of my TV show.  And we're 
		invited to a big Christmas party.

They continue driving, now in a less residential area, passing a hot-dog stand.
"Tail-Pup" concession; people mill about eating hot dogs.

				VOICES 
			(Singing, louder now)
		Remember Christ our Savior
		Was born on Christmas day
		To save us all ... from Satan's power
		As we were gone astray.

They pass a theater, the marquee announcing "House of Exorcism Messiah of Evil.
Rated R.  Starts at 7:15."

INT. TV CONTROL ROOM.

Several monitors line the wall in front of an elaborate console.  Rob and Alvy,
along with Charlie, the technician, stand in the small room watching the 
screens showing Rob as a television star on a situation comedy.  They chatter, 
analyzing the footage, over the sounds of the taped television comedy.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the chatter) 
		Oh.

				ROB 
		Look, now, Charlie, give me a big 
		laugh here.

				ROB ON TV SCREEN 
		A limousine to the track breakdown?

				ROB
 				(Watching) 
		A little bigger.

TV monitors go black as the technician turns of the monitors to fix the laugh 
track.

				ALVY 
		Do you realize how immoral this all is?

				ROB
 			Max, I've got a hit series.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake 
		laughs.

Technicians turn the monitors back on, showing Rob on the screen with another 
character, Arnie.

				ARNIE 
		Oh, I'm sorry.

				ROB ON TV SCREEN 
		Arnie.

				ARNIE 
		Yeah.

				ROB 
			(Turning to the technician) 
		Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.

				ALVY 
		Look, uh ...

Loud laughter from the TV monitors.

				ROB 
			(To Alvy) 
		We do the show live in front of an 
		audience.

				ALVY 
		Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause 
		your jokes aren't funny.

				ROB 
		Yeah, well, that's why this machine 
		is dynamite.

				ROB ON TV SCREEN 
		You better lie down.  You've been in 
		the sun too long.

				ROB 
			(To the technician) 
		Yeah ... uh, now give me a like a 
		medium-size chuckle here ... and 
		then a big hand.

The sounds of laughter and applause are heard from the TV.

				ALVY
			(Removing his glasses and 
			rubbing his face) 
		Is there booing on there?

The monitors show a woman on the screen.

				WOMAN 
		We were just gonna fix you up with my 
		cousin Dolores.

				ALVY 
			(Overlapping the TV) 
		Oh, Max, I don't feel well.

				ROB 
		What's the matter?

				ALVY 
		I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... 
			(Coughing) 
		I feel dizzy, Max.

				ROB 
		Well, sit down.

				ALVY 
			(Sitting down) 
		Oh, Jesus.

				ROB 
		You all right?

				ALVY 
		I don't know, I mean, I-

				ROB 
			(Crouching before Alvy, looking 
			at him) 
		You wanna lie down?

				ALVY 
		No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt 
		queasy all morning.  I just started 
		getting ...

				ROB 
		How about a ginger ale?

				ALVY 
		Oh, Max ... no, I maybe I better lie 
		down.

INT. HOTEL ROOM.

Alvy lies in bed, one elbow propped up, a doctor sitting next to him looking 
concerned.  The doctor bolds out a plate of chicken; Alvy listlessly stares at 
it. Annie, in the background, is on the phone.

				ANNIE 
			(Talking into the phone) 
		Yes.

				DOCTOR 
			(Holding out the food) 
		Why don't you just try to get a little 
		of this down?  This is just plain chicken.

				ALVY
			(Taking a piece of chicken and 
			holding it) 
		Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this.  
		I'm nauseous. 
			(He gasps and makes sounds) 
		If you could-if you could just give me 
		something to get me through the next two 
		hours, you know I-I have to go out to 
		Burbank ... and give out an award on a 
		TV show.

				ANNIE 
			(On the phone, overlapping the 
			doctor and Alvy) 
		Well ... H-h huh ... Oh, good ... Yes, 
		I'll tell him.

				DOCTOR 
		Well, there's nothing wrong with you 
		actually, so far as I can tell.  I mean, 
		you have no fever, no ... no symptoms 
		of anything serious.  You haven't been 
		eating pork or shellfish.

Annie bangs up and moves over to Alvy.

				ANNIE 
			(Sitting on the edge of the bed) 
		Excuse me.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor.  
		Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show.  They 
		said everything is fine.  They found a 
		replacement, so they're going to tape 
		without you.

				ALVY
			(Making sounds) 
		I'm nauseous.
			(He sighs and gasps)
		Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the 
		TV show?

Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of 
chicken he has been holding.  The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting.

				ANNIE
 			Yeah.  Listen, Doctor, I'm worried.

				DOCTOR 
		Now, Mrs. Singer, I can't find anything --

				ALVY 
		Christ!

				ANNIE 
		Nothing at all?

				DOCTOR 
		No, I think I can get a lab man up here.

				ALVY  
			(Grabbing the rest of the chicken 
			from the plate) 
		Oh, jesus. Can I have the salt, please?

				ANNIE 
		What do you mean?  Do you think he's-

				DOCTOR 
			(Handing the salt to Alvy) 
		Yes, excuse me. 
			(To Annie) 
		Perhaps it would be even better if we 
		took him to the hospital for a day or two.

Alvy begins to eat.

				ANNIE 
		Uh-huh ... Oh, hospital?

				DOCTOR 
		Well, otherwise, there's no real way to 
		tell what's going on. 

				ALVY 
			(Making sounds, gasping) 
		This is not bad, actually.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's car pull into a long circular driveway as an 
attendant walks over to the car.  A sprawling house is seen to the right; a 
couple moves toward the front door, and the driveway is crowded with other 
parked cars.  Loud music is heard.

				ALVY 
			(Getting out of the car) 
		Hey, don't tell me we're gonna hafta 
		walk from the car to the house.  Geez, 
		my feet haven't touched pavement since 
		I reached Los Angeles.

INT. HOUSE

A Hollywood Christmas party is in session, complete with music, milling people,
circulating waiters bolding out trays of drinks.  It's all very casual. French 
doors run the entire width of one wall; they are opened to the back lawn, 
guests move from the room to outside and back in.  It is crowded; bits of 
conversation and clinking glasses can be heard.  Two men, California-tanned, 
stand by the French doors talking.

				1ST MAN 
		Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll 
		take a meeting with you if you'll take 
		a meeting with Freddy.

				2ND MAN 
		I took a meeting with Freddy.  Freddy 
		took a meeting with Charlie.  You take 
		a meeting with him.

				1ST MAN 
		All the good meetings are taken.

								CUT TO:

FULL GROUP SHOT

A man stands talking, people in groups behind him.  Two born like gadgets are 
attached to his shoulders; he's wearing a bizarre space costume.

				3RD MAN 
		Right now it's only a notion, but I 
		think I can get money to make it into 
		a concept ... and later turn it into 
		an idea.

								CUT TO:

Alvy and Rob stand near the French doors leading to the back lawn, eating and 
drinking and watching the people walking in and out of the house.

				ROB 
		You like this house, Max?

				ALVY 
		M'hm.

				ROB 
		I even brought a road map to get us to 
		the bathroom.

				ALVY 
		Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony 
		Lacey's party.

				ROB 
		What difference does that make?

Alvy looks into the room, where Annie and Tony Lacey are having an animated 
conversation.

ALVY 
		I think he has a little thing for Annie.

				ROB 
		Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max.  He 
		goes with that girl over there.

				ALVY 
		Where?

Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a 
group of people close-by.

				ROB 
		The one with the V.P.L.

				ALVY 
		V.P.L.?

				ROB 
		Visible panty line.  Max, she is gorgeous.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great 
		for you because you're -you're used to 
		twos, aren't you?

				ROB 
		There are no twos, Max.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, you're used to the kind with the-
		with the shopping bags walking through 
		Central Park with the surgical masks 
		on muttering.

				ROB 
		M'hm.

				ALVY 
		And ... uh-

				ROB 
			(Interrupting) 
		How do you like this couple, Max?

A couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy.  The man's arm is around the woman; 
they stand very close.  In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking.

				ROB 
		And I think they just came back from 
		Masters and Johnson.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, intensive care ward. 
			(Watching the woman in white) 
		My God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I 
		think she's giving me the eye. 

As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward 
them.

				ROB 
		If she comes over here, Max, my brain 
		is going to turn into guacamole.

				ALVY
 			I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  Hi.

				GIRL IN WHITE  
		You're Alvy Singer, right?  Didn't 
		we meet at EST?

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		EST?  No, no, I was never to est.

				GIRL IN WHITE 
		Then how can you criticize it?

				ALVY 
		Oh.

				ROB 
		Oh, he-he didn't say anything.

				ALVY 
			(Laughing) 
		No, no, I came out here to get some 
		shock therapy, but there was an energy 
		crisis, so I ... He's my-my food taster.  
		Have you two met?

				ROB
			(Shaking his head) 
		Hi.  How do you do.

				GIRL IN WHITE 
		Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned?

				ALVY
 			Yeah, he's crazy.

The girl in white laughs.

				ALVY 
 				(Looking at Rob and the girl) 
		Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must 
		be in the stars.

				ROB 
		Yeah.  Right.

				ALVY 
		Uri Geller must be on the premises 
		someplace.

				ROB 
		We're gonna operate together.

Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie 
standing by the buffet table.

				TONY 
		We just need about six weeks, in about 
		six weeks we could cut a whole album.

				ANNIE
		I don't know, this is strange to me, 
		you know.

				TONY
		just ... that's all you need.  You can 
		come and stay here.

				ANNIE
		Oh.

				TONY 
		There's a whole wing in this house.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Oh yeah, stay here?  U-huh.

				TONY 
		You can have it to use.  Why-why are 
		you smiling?

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		I don't know.  I don't know.

She picks up an hors doeuvre.

								CUT TO:

The two men still talking about meetings surrounded by other groups of people 
milling about.

				1ST MAN 
		Not only is he a great agent, but he 
		really gives good meetings.

				2ND MAN   
		M'mm.

Tony, band in band with the girl in white, is leaving the party room with Alvy 
and Annie to show them the rest of the house.

				TONY 
		This is a great house, really.  Everything.  
		Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.  
		You know who the original owners were?  
		Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.  Then 
		you know who lived here?

				ALVY 
		Trigger.

Annie and the girl in white laugh.

				TONY 
		Charlie Chaplin.

				ALVY 
		Hey.

				TONY 
		Right before his un-American thing.

They stop in a den-like screening room.  A man is slouched back on one of the 
comfortable sofas that fill the room.  It is much quieter in here; a contrast 
to the noise and crowd downstairs.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, this place is great.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY 
		Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still 
		New Yorkers.

				ALVY  
		Yeah, I love it there.

				ANNIE 
			(Laughing) 
		Yeah.

				TONY 
		Well, I used to live there.  I used to 
		live there for years.  You know, but 
		it's gotten-it's so dirty now.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				ALVY 
		I'm into garbage.  It's my thing.

				ANNIE 
		Boy, this is really a nice screening 
		room.  It's really a nice room.

				TONY 
		Oh, and there's another thing about New 
		York.  See ... you-you wanna see a movie, 
		you have to stand in a long line.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY
 			It could be freezing, it could be raining.

				ANNIE 
		Yeah.

				TONY
		And here, you just-

				GIRL IN WHITE 
		We saw "Grand Illusion" here last night.

				ALVY AND ANNIE 
			(In unison) 
		Oh, yeah?

				MAN ON THE SOFA 
			(Looking over his shoulder at 
			the group) 
		That's a great film if you're high. 
			(The group laughs, looking down 
			at the man on the sofa. He looks 
			up at them, smiling, a joint in 
			his hand, and offers them a cigarette) 
		Hey, you.

				TONY 
			(Shaking his head no) 
		Come and see our bedroom.  We did a 
		fantastic lighting job.  Okay?

				ANNIE
 			Oh, good.  Okay.

				ALVY 
		I'm cool.

Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following.

				ANNIE 
			(Taking Alvy's arm) 
		It's wonderful. I mean, you know they 
		just watch movies all day.

				ALVY 
		Yeah, and gradually you get old and die.  
		You know it's important to make a little 
		effort once in a while.

				ANNIE 
		Don't you think his girl friend's 
		beautiful?

				ALVY 
		Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A 
		pat on the androgynous side.  But it's...

They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway.

				MAN ON THE PHONE 
		Yeah, yeah.  I forgot my mantra.

As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear.  People are looser 
now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate 
corners, some couples are dancing.  Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the 
huge Christmas tree.  A tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves. 
He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of 
the room dancing.

The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then:

								CUT TO:

AIRPLANE.  INT. AIRPLANE

Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers. Annie
stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads.  Both are preoccupied, 
thinking their own thoughts.

				ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
			(To herself) 
		That was fun.  I don't think California 
		is bad at all.  It's a drag coming home.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
			(To himself) 
		Lotta beautiful women.  It was fun 
		to flirt.

				ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
			(As she sips coffee) 
		I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, 
		but our relationship doesn't seem to 
		work anymore.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
			(An open magazine lies in 
			his lap) 
		I'll have the usual trouble with Annie 
		in bed tonight.  Whatta I need this?

				ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
		If only I had the nerve to break up, 
		but it would really hurt him.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		If only I didn't feel guilty asking 
		Annie to move out.  It'd probably 
		wreck her.  But I should be honest.

He looks over at Annie.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking back at Alvy) 
		Alvy, uh, let's face it.  You know 
		something, don't think our relationship 
		is working.

				ALVY 
		Tsch, I know.  A relationship, I think, 
		is-is like a shark, you know?  It has 
		to constantly move forward or it dies. 
			(He sighs) 
		And I think what we got on our hands 
			(Clearing his throat) 
		is a dead shark.

INT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY

A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general 
disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie 
move out.

				ALVY 
			(Holding up a book) 
		Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?

				ANNIE 
			(Walking into the room with an 
			armload of books) 
		Well, let's see now ... If it has my 
		name on it, then I guess it's mine.

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote 
		your name in all my books, 'cause you 
		knew this day was gonna come.

				ANNIE 
			(Putting down the books and 
			flipping back her hair) 
		Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up 
		just as much as I do.

				ALVY 
			(Riffling through the books) 
		There's no-no question in my mind.  I 
		think we're doing the mature thing, 
		without any doubt.

				ANNIE 
			(Holding a framed picture and 
			moving about) 
		Now, look, all the books on death and 
		dying are yours and all the poetry books 
		are mine.

				ALVY 
			(Looking down at a book) 
		This "Denial of Death".  You remember this?

				ANNIE 
		Oh-

				ALVY 
		This is the first book that I got you.

Annie goes over to Alvy.  They both look down at the book; the fireplace, 
burning nicely, is behind them.

				ANNIE 
		-God.

				ALVY 
		Remember that day?

				ANNIE 
		Right.  Geez, I feel like there's a 
		great weight off my back.  M'mmm.

				ALVY 
		Thanks, honey.

				ANNIE 
			(Patting Alvy's shoulder) 
		Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, you 
		know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's 
		really important for us to explore new 
		relationships and stuff like that.

She walks away.

				ALVY 
		There's no-there's no question about 
		that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, 
		uh, I think a more than fair shot, 
		you know?

He tosses the book into the carton.

				ANNIE 
			(Off screen) 
		Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is 
		keen for me.

				ALVY 
			(Off screen)  
		Yeah, and I-I tru-  you know, I trust 
		her, because my-my analyst recommended 
		her.

				ANNIE 
			(Walking in with another 
			armload of books) 
		Well, why should I put you through all 
		my moods and hang-ups anyway?

				ALVY 
		Right.  And you-and you know what the 
		beauty part is?

				ANNIE 
		What?

				ALVY 
			(Holding a small box of buttons) 
		We can always come back together again.  
		Because there's no-there's no problem.  
		'Cause ... Right.

				ANNIE 
			(Overlapping) 
		Exactly, but ... exactly.  Ooooh!

				ALVY 
		You know, I-I-I don't think many couples 
		could handle this.  You know, they could 
		just break up and remain friends.

				ANNIE 
			(Taking a button from a box) 
		Hey, this one's mine, this button.
		This one, you rem-

				ALVY 
			(Interrupting) 
		Yeah.

				ANNIE 
		I guess these are all yours.  Impeach, uh, 
		Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach 
		Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET-DAY

People milling about on the sidewalk as Alvy walks out of a store and moves 
toward the foreground.

				ALVY 
			(Into the camera, to the audience) 
		I miss Annie.  I made a terrible 
		mistake.

A couple, walking down the street, stops as the man talks to Alvy.

				MAN ON THE STREET 
		She's living in Los Angeles with 
		Tony Lacey.

				ALVY 
		Oh, yeah?  Well, if she is, then the 
		hell with her!  If she likes that 
		lifestyle, let her live there!  He's 
		a jerk, for one thing.

				MAN ON THE STREET 
		He graduated Harvard.

				ALVY
 			Yeah. He may- Listen, Harvard makes 
		mistakes too, you know.  Kissinger 
		taught there.  

The couple strolls away as an older woman walks up to Alvy while others walk by.

				OLD WOMAN 
		Don't tell me you're jealous?

				ALVY 
		Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. 
		Lemme, lemme-can I show you something, 
		lady? 
			(He takes a small item from his 
			pocket to show the woman) 
		What I have here ... I found this in the 
		apartment.  Black soap.  She used to wash 
		her face eight hundred times a day with 
		black soap. Don't ask me why.

				OLD WOMAN 
		Well, why don't you go out with other 
		women?

				ALVY 
		Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know, 
		it's very depressing.

RECENT FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S COUNTRY KITCHEN

Alvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor 
bolding up a live lobster.  He puts it on a grill tray.

				ALVY 
			(Pointing to the lobster) 
		This always happens to me.  Quick, g-go 
		get a broom. 

His date, a girl wearing short shorts, leans against the sink and lights a 
cigarette.  She makes no move to help.

				GIRL DATE 
			(Smoking) 
		What are you making such a big deal about? 
			(As she talks, the lobster drops 
			from the tray to the floor.  Alvy 
			jumps away, then gingerly scrapes 
			the tray toward the lobster) 
		They're only lobsters.  Look, you're a 
		grown man, you know how to pick up a 
		lobster.

				ALVY 
			(Looking up in stooped-over 
			position) 
		I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.

				GIRL DATE 
			(Still leaning against the sink, 
			her hand on her hip) 
		Oh, when'd you quit smoking? 

He gets up of the floor with the lobster on the tray.

				ALVY 
		Sixteen years ago.

				GIRL DATE 
			(Puzzled) 
		Whatta you mean?  

				ALVY 
			(Mocking) 
		Mean?

				GIRL DATE 
		You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, 
		is that what you said?  Oh, I-I don't 
		understand.  Are you joking, or what?

								CUT TO:

A solitary Alvy walking along the FDR Drive where he had walked with Annie. - 
The New York skyline is still in the background, the sea gulls go by, the fog 
horn blows.  He walks slowly, moving off screen.

INT. ALVY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Alvy sits on his bed talking on the phone.

				ALVY 
		Listen, honey, Central Park's turning 
		green ... Yeah, I sa-I saw that lunatic 
		that we-where we used to see ... with 
		the, uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, 
		and the roller skates? . . . Listen, 
		I-I want you to come back here ... Well, 
		I-I-then I'm gonna come out there and 
		getcha.

An airborne plane.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT.

People milling about as Alvy, in the outside phone-booth center, talks.

				ALVY 
		Whatta you mean, where am I? Where do-
		where do you think I am?  I'm-I'm out 
		... I'm at the Los Angeles Airport.  
		I flew in ... 
			(Sniffling) 
		Tsch, I-well, I flew in to see you ... 
			(Muttering) 
		Hey, listen, can we not debate this 
		on-on the telephone because I'm, you 
		know, I-I feel that I got a temperature 
		and I'm-I'm getting my-my chronic Los 
		Angeles nausea. I-I don't feel so good.

Alvy's conversation is still heard as the screen shows him behind the wheel of 
a car on a busy street; he causes a near-accident by jerking the car too slowly
toward an intersection.

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I 
		don't care.  I'll-I'll drive in.  I 
		rented a car I'm driving ... that ... 
		Whatta you mean?  What-why is that such 
		a miracle?  I'm driving myself --

EXT. OUTDOOR CAF - DAY

People sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a Sunset 
Boulevard outdoor cafe.  Street traffic goes by while they dine.  There's a 
mild California breeze.  The restaurant is somewhat crowded as Alvy makes his 
way around the tables looking about.  He finally sits down at an empty table; 
nearby sits a woman with a younger man.  A waitress brings Alvy a menu and 
waits for his order.

				ALVY
			(To the waitress) 
		I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa 
		sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.

Annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view.  Alvy,
noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table.  He rises and they shake 
hands.

				ANNIE 
		Hi.

Alvy wipes at his nose as he stares.  He smiles, the street traffic moving 
behind him. Annie smiles back.

				ALVY 
		You look very pretty.

				ANNIE 
		Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, 
		that's all. 
			(Alvy adjusts his glasses, not 
			exactly knowing where to start; 	
			a bit uneasy) 
		Well, you look nice.

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head) 
		You see, I-I've been thinking about it 
		and I think that we should get married.

				ANNIE 
			(Adjusting her sunglasses) 
		Oh, Alvy, come on.

				ALVY 
		Why?  You wanna live out here all year?  
		It's like living in Munchkin Land.

				ANNIE 
			(Looking around) 
		Well, whatta you mean?  I mean, it's 
		perfectly fine out here.  I mean, Tony's 
		very nice and, uh, well, I meet people 
		and I go to parties and-and we play tennis.  
		I mean, that's ... that's a very big step 
		for me, you know?  I mean ... 
			(Reacting, Alvy looks down at 
			his hands, then up) 
		I'm able to enjoy people more.

				ALVY 
			(Sadly) 
		So whatta you ... You're not gonna come 
		back to New York?

				ANNIE 
			(Smiling) 
		What's so great about New York?  I mean, 
		it's a dying city.  You read "Death in 
		Venice."

				ALVY 
		Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice"
		till I bought it for yuh.

				ANNIE 
		That's right, that's right. 
			(Still smiling) 
		You only gave me books with the word 
		"death" in the titles.

				ALVY 
			(Nodding his head and gesturing) 
		That's right, 'cause it's an important 
		issue.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, 
		you know that?  I mean, your life is New 
		York City.  You're just this person.  
		You're like this island unto yourself.

				ALVY 
			(Toying with his car keys) 
		I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless 
		everybody is.  I-you know, if one guy is 
		starving someplace, that's ... you know, 
		I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening. 
			(Looking down at his hands, sadly) 
		So wanna get married or what?

				ANNIE 
			(Seriously) 
		No. We're friends.  I wanna remain friends.

				ALVY 
			(In disbelief) 
		Okay. 
			(Louder, to the waitress) 
		Check, please.  Can I -can I ... 
		Can I ... Can I ...

				ANNIE 
			(Interrupting) 
		You're mad, aren't you?

				ALVY 
			(Shaking his head) 
		No. 
			(Then nodding) 
		Yes, of course I'm mad, because you 
		love me, I know that.

				ANNIE 
		Alvy, I can't say that that's true at 
		this point in my life.  I really just 
		can't say that that's true.  I mean, 
		you know how wonderful you are.  I 
		mean, you know ... you're the reason 
		that I got outta my room and that I 
		was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, 
		get more in touch with my feelings and 
		all that crap.  Anyway, look, I don't 
		wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh 
			(Laughing) 
		h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?

				ALVY
			(Shrugging his shoulders) 
		The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. 
		I'm workin' on a play. 
			(Sighing) 
		Jesus.  So whatta yuh saying?  That 
		you're not comin' back to New York with
		me?

He nods his head in disbelief.

				ANNIE 
			(Nodding) 
		No! 
			(Pauses) 
		Look, I gotta go.

She starts to rise.

				ALVY 
		You mean that ... 
			(He gets up and starts following 
			her past diners at other tables) 
		I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to 
		see you.

				ANNIE 
		I'm late.

				ALVY 
		Air miles, you know.  I mean, you 
		know what that does to my stomach?

They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.

				ANNIE 
		If you must know, it's a hectic time 
		for Tony.  The Grammys are tonight.

				ALVY 
		The what?

				ANNIE 
		The Grammys.  He's got a lotta records 
		up for awards.

				ALVY 
		You mean they give awards for that 
		kind o' music?

				ANNIE
 			Oh!

				ALVY 
		I thought just earplugs.

Annie gets into her car.  Alvy moves over to his rented convertible.

				ANNIE 
		Just forget it, Alvy, okay?  Let's 
		just forget the conversation.

She closes the door, starts the motor.

				ALVY
			(Yelling after her) 
		Awards! They do nothing but give out 
		awards!  I can't believe it.  Greatest, 
		greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!  

Annie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the 
car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with
a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has 
just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a 
flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park.  Alvy's father
is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping 
others right and left.  Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible,
purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper-
car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a 
small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking 
lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force.

Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the 
track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father 
directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy 
reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car.

He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens 
start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop 
gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him.

				ALVY 
			(Getting out of the car) 
		Officer, I know what you're gonna say.  
		I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, 
		I-I have some problems with-with-with-

				OFFICER 
			(Interrupting) 
		May I see your license, please?

				ALVY 
		Sure. 
			(Searching, he finally fishes 
			his license out of his pocket) 
		just don't-don't get angry, you know 
		what I mean?  'Cause I-I have - I have 
		my-my license here.  You know, it's a 
		rented car.  And I've ...

He drops the license and it falls to the ground.

				OFFICER
 			Don't give me your life story 
			(Looking at the piece of paper 
			on the ground)
		-just pick up the license.

				ALVY 
		Pick up the license.  You have to ask 
		nicely 'cause I've had an extremely 
		rough day.  You know, my girl friend-

				OFFICER 
			(Interrupting) 
		Just give me the license, please.

				ALVY 
		Since you put it that way. 
			(He laughs) 
		It's hard for me to refuse. 
			(He leans over, picks up the 
			license, then proceeds to rip 
			it up.  He lets the pieces go; 
			they float to the ground)
		... have a, I have a terrific problem 
		with authority, you know.  I'm... it's 
		not your fault.  Don't take it personal.

								CUT TO:

INT. JAIL-CELLS CORRIDOR.

A guard moves down the ball to the cell where, Alvy stands with other inmates.
He unlocks the door and opens it, letting Alvy out.

				ALVY 
		So long, fellas.  Keep in touch. 

He walks down the corridor off screen.

EXT. A STREET IN FRONT OF THE COURT HOUSE - DAY

Policemen are walking up and down the courthouse steps as Alvy and Rob move 
out the door of the building, down the steps to the street.

				ROB 
		Imagine my surprise when I got your 
		call, Max.

				ALVY 
			(Carrying his jacket over his 
			shoulder) 
		Yeah.  I had the feeling that I got 
		you at a bad moment.  You know, I heard 
		high-pitched squealing.

They walk over to Rob's convertible and get in.

				ROB 
			(Starting the car) 
		Twins, Max.  Sixteen-year-olds.  Can you 
		imagine the mathematical possibilities?

				ALVY 
			(Reacting) 
		You're an actor, Max.  You should be 
		doing Shakespeare in the Park.

				ROB 
		Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.  
		I got mugged.  I was playing Richard the 
		Second and two guys with leather jackets 
		stole my leotard.

He puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles.

				ALVY 
			(Looking at Rob's helmet) 
		Max, are we driving through plutonium?

				ROB 
		Keeps out the alpha rays, Max.  You 
		don't get old.

								CUT TO:

INT. REHEARSAL HALL OF A THEATER.

An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball.  
They face each other.  The actress resembles Annie; the actor, Alvy.

				ACTOR 
		You're a thinking person.  How can you 
		choose this lifestyle?

				ACTRESS 
		What is so incredibly great about New 
		York?  It's a dying city!  You-you read 
		"Death in Venice".

				ACTOR 
		You didn't read "Death in Venice" till 
		I gave it to you!

				ACTRESS 
		Well, you only give me books with the 
		word "death" in the title.

The camera pulls back, showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up 
near the actors.  A mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the 
two actors, a script lying on the table between them.  It is obvious now that 
they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote.

				ACTOR 
			(In mirrored reflection) 
		It's an important issue.

				ACTRESS 
			(In mirrored reflection) 
		Alvy, you are totally incapable of 
		enjoying life.

The camera moves back to actual actor and actress.

				ACTRESS 
		You're like New York.  You're an island.

				ACTOR 
			(Rising with emotion) 
		Okay, if that's all that we've been 
		through together means to you, I guess 
		it's better if we just said goodbye, 
		once and for all!  You know, it's funny, 
		after all the serious talks and passionate 
		moments that it ends here ... in a health
		-food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.  
		Goodbye, Sunny.

The actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair.

				ACTRESS 
		Wait!  I'm-I'm gonna ... go with you. 
			(The actor comes back. They embrace) 
		I love you.

The camera cuts to Alvy, who turns and looks straight into the camera.

				ALVY 
			(To the audience, gesturing) 
		Tsch, whatta you want?  It was my first 
		play.  You know, you know how you're 
		always tryin' t' get things to come out 
		perfect in art because, uh, it's real 
		difficult in life.  Interestingly, however, 
		I did run into Annie again.  It was on the 
		Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Annie, singing "Seems Like Old Times, " overlaps Alvy's speech and continues 
over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater, 
shakes hands with Annie and her escort.  The theater marquee reads "OPHULS 
PRIZE FILM: 'THE SORROW AND THE PITY'."

				ALVY'S VOICE
			(Over the theater scene and, 
			Annie's singing) 
		She had moved back to New York.  She was 
		living in SoHo with some guy. 
			(Laughing) 
		And when I met her she was, of all things, 
		dragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the 
		Pity."  Which I counted as a personal 
		triumph.  Annie and I ... 
			(Alvy's voice continues over the 
			scene shot through a window of 
			Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and 
			Annie sitting at a table, laughing 
			and enjoying themselves) 
		... we had lunch sometime after that, and, 
		uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.

A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to 
sing:

Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie 
driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich.

Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to 
Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove.

Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.

Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and 
sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home 
in her car.

Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie
and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the "Death" titles; Annie and, Alvy in 
their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts 
in the red light.

The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's 
house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing 
tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college 
performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came 
over to kill the spider.

And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy 
following, the day she first moved into his apartment.  Annie holding up her 
sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and 
Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park
bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City 
skyline behind them.
The music stops.

Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows 
Annie and Alvy across street.  They look about at the city traffic.  Lunch is 
over; it's time.

Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like.  Annie crosses 
the street, Alvy watching her go.  Then he turns, and slowly walks down the 
street off screen.  His voice is heard over the scene:

				ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
		After that it got pretty late.  And we 
		both hadda go, but it was great seeing 
		Annie again, right?  I realized what a 
		terrific person she was and-and how much 
		fun it was just knowing her and I-I 
		thought of that old joke, you know, this-
		this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and 
		says, "Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He 
		thinks he's a chicken." And, uh, the 
		doctor says, "Well, why don't you turn 
		him in?" And the guy says, "I would, but 
		I need the eggs." Well, I guess that's 
		pretty much how how I feet about 
		relationships.  You know, they're totally 
		irrational and crazy and absurd and ... 
		but, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it 
		because, uh, most of us need the eggs.

				THE END

THE ARTIST


                            Written by

                       Michel Hazanavicius




    Silent film, illustrated musically, with some title cards to
    indicate the dialogues, with actors whose lips move when they
    speak although we never hear their voices. The images are in
    black and white, in format 1.33.


1   TITLES                                                       1

    The letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of
    the 1920s. Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame, and,
    in the background, there are geometrical shapes reminiscent
    of the light beams of a film première. Behind is a stylized
    town. The titles end in a fade to black. On black, the date
    appears on the screen: 1927


2   INT. LABORATORY - DAY                                        2

    In a "futuristic" 1920s laboratory, a man in tail coat and
    bow tie is being tortured. Ultrasound is being piped into his
    ears. It's incredibly painful! He's screaming.

    Title card:
    I'm not telling!   I won't talk!!!

    His torturers, cold men of science in white coats, gradually
    increase the volume. The pain seems unbearable, the volume
    reaches level 10 (maximum), the man passes out!


3   INT. CELLS & CORRIDORS - DAY                                 3

    Guards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a
    cell!

    As the man is lying there on the ground, a dog wiggles
    through the bars at the window. The dog, a Jack Russell,
    jumps on top of the man - visibly his master - and begins to
    lick his face. The man opens one eye! When he sees his dog,
    he can't help cracking a smile...

    The man, now on his feet, looks in pain. Despite the pain, he
    motions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion.

    Outside the cell, the guard looks curious about the noise. He
    goes to the door, opens the spy flap and finds himself face
    to face with the man, eye to eye just a couple of inches
    apart! The man moves his eyes in such a way that he
    hypnotizes the guard! Superimposed on the screen: a spinning
    black and white spiral, until the dazed guard take his keys,
    opens the door and releases the man and his dog.
                                                                 2.


    The man (the hero, thus) imprisons the guard without harming
    him, then runs over to the guard's desk. His ears are still
    causing him pain, but he opens a drawer and takes out his
    belongings: a top hat which he snaps open, and a mask, which
    he puts over his head to conceal his eyes.

    We catch up with the masked man walking down corridors. He
    suddenly stops, copied by his dog who follows him like his
    shadow. The man, on his guard, has spotted another guard
    where two corridors meet.

    With a look, he orders his dog to move forwards into the
    guard's line of sight. The guard looks over at the animal.
    Using his fingers, the hero pretends to shoot his dog. The
    dog collapses, plays dead. The guard, increasingly curious,
    gets to his feet. He slowly approaches the motionless dog.
    When he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero,
    who quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch!

    The masked man then rushes to another cell, and releases a
    young female prisoner. She too is wearing evening dress. As
    she is thanking him he staggers and clutches his ears in
    pain. She's concerned.

    Title card:
    Can I help you in some way?

    He refuses.

    Title card:
    No. I don't get helped.   I give the help around here.

    He composes himself. She casts him an admiring glance. Then,
    in view of the urgency of their situation, they escape at a
    run.


4   EXT. HOUSE/LABORATORY - DAY                                       4

    They come out of a house that is lost in the hills, climb
    into a Bugatti sports car that the man starts by rubbing two
    wires together, and speed off.


5   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                   5

    The car speeds along the road. Its occupants turn round to
    check they aren't being followed.
                                                              3.


6   INT. HOUSE/LAB - DAY                                           6

    The guard who got knocked out picks himself up, realizes what's
    happened and dashes over to his office. He grabs a radio
    emitter and begins sending a message.


7   EXT. AIR FIELD - DAY                                           7

    The hero, the young woman and the dog come to a halt in the
    Bugatti on the air field, by a telegraph pole whose wires
    lead...to a watch tower.

    In the watch tower, a radio receptor is vibrating. A soldier
    approaches, listens and suddenly understands! He grabs hold of
    his gun and goes out onto the air field, only to find the
    fugitives! He tries to shoot at them as he draws closer, but
    the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him, before
    climbing inside where the woman and dog are waiting for him.

    The airplane begins to move.

    The soldier shoots.

    The airplane is positioning itself on the runway, while the
    soldier continues to fire!

    The aircraft gains speed.

    The soldier is still shooting, but too late, as the heroo pulls
    back the joystick, and the airplane takes to the sky...

    The soldier is furious, but the hero is all smiles as he looks
    back towards the ground and shouts something.

    Title card: Free Georgia forever!!!

    The airplane flies away into the evening sky.


8   EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT                                          8

    A little later in the night, still at the controls, the man is
    fighting not to fall asleep. Behind him, the women is sleeping,
    the dog is lying in her arms. Suddenly she is awoken by
    explosions happening close by! Pandemonium! The man doesn't
    understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly
    notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and
    inoffensive. He consults a calendar dial on the control panel
    that shows it is July 14th, immediately understands, and
    bursts into laughter.

    Title card: We've arrived, welcome to France!!!
                                                               4.


     As the music picks up the tune of The Marseillaise, the
     airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks...

     The words "The End" appear on the screen.


9    INT. WINGS MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                   9

     From the moment they parked the car onwards, we become
     absorbed by what's happening around the screening of end of
     this film.

     Behind the screen, we've seen the actor who plays the hero -
     his name is George Valentin - closely studying the reactions
     of the audience. He was standing close to his dog, motioning
     to it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack.

     In the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name
     is Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto
     the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on
     a cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely
     the producer.


10   INT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                     10

     In the house, much of the audience is open-mouthed, excited,
     immobile and often wide-eyed.

     In the pit, a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film.

     (9) Now that the film is ending, and the last note is
     sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict,
     which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into
     thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the
     people around him, especially the actress and the producer,
     who kiss each other on the lips.

     Two theater hands bring down the curtain.

     (10) The lights come on. George Valentin comes onto the stage
     and acknowledges the audience, they are cheering for him. He
     is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then
     he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to
     someone in the wings to join him. Jack the dog trots over in
     response. The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the
     dog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people
     are loving it!

     In the wings, Constance is fuming with rage, but on stage,
     George is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog, who
     fakes death. Thunderous applause again.
                                                               5.


     Behind the actress, the producer can't hold back a smile, and
     this enrages the actress still more.

     Suddenly, George, hamming it up, remembers something he'd
     forgotten, and asks someone from the other side of the wings
     to join him. It's Constance. She comes over, smiling to the
     audience, and says something to George with a smile.

     Title card: I'll get you for that.

     She waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her
     teeth. She isn't feeling comfortable. George motions firing a
     gun with his fingers, but she does not fall down, merely
     casts him a "very funny" glance. George looks at his fingers,
     not understanding why they don't work anymore then mimes
     throwing them away behind him, as though they've become
     useless. Constance stalks back off into the wings in
     annoyance, but the audience is ecstatic. Once in the wings,
     the actress sticks up her middle finger at George, and
     exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips: "Put this up
     your ass." George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his
     hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few
     more dance steps as he does so. The audience is delighted.

     As he comes off stage, George gets soundly told off by
     Constance, but, still grinning, he motions towards the
     audience who are still asking for more. The producer,
     although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak
     attempt to calm the actress down. As for George, he returns
     to the stage, the audience roars. He pretends to want to
     leave the stage, and mimes bumping into an invisible wall
     just as he's leaving the stage. George holds his nose, the
     audience goes wild, Constance gets even madder, and while
     George carries on clowning about, the producer too breaks
     into a beaming smile. He's probably realized that George has
     the audience on his side... Constance, furious, storms off. She
     is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her,
     although it looks like he's got his work cut out for him.


11   EXT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                      11

     Outside, we are in front of a typically American movie theater
     decked out with all the accessories of a grand première. The
     entrance is lit up, there are crowds gathered on the sidewalk,
     cops are guarding the red carpet with a cordon of bodies, etc.

     George comes out, causing the crowds, mainly young women, to
     press forwards - and the photographers' flashes to spark into
     life. The cops are struggling to maintain control of the
     situation as George poses for the photographers and waves at
     his many fans.
                                                               6.


     In the crowd, a young woman right at the front is staring at
     him in rapture. She drops her bag and, as she bends to pick it
     up, a swell in the crowd pushes her underneath the arms of the
     policeman in front of her, out of the crowd and into George.
     She stares at him, more in love than ever, delighted to be
     there. The police wait for someone to give orders. George
     doesn't quite know what to do. Nobody moves. The young woman
     finally bursts out laughing, which, after a moment of shock,
     causes George to laugh too, thus placating the cops and tacitly
     signaling to the photographers that they can take pictures of
     the scene. The flashes seem to lend the woman self-confidence
     who, in a very carefree manner, begins to clown about in front
     of them. George is delighted at the sight, by the whole scene
     and, realizing this, the young woman steals a kiss. Flash. The
     image becomes static, then dissolves into the printed picture
     on the front page of "The Hollywood Reporter" newspaper, along
     with three other pictures of the scene and the headline WHO'S
     THAT GIRL?


12   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           12

     The very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman
     sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table. We are in the large
     dining room of an ultra-luxurious Hollywood villa. All around
     her are magnificent furniture, superb paintings and objets
     d'art, including a beautiful trio of monkeys, one hiding its
     eyes, one with hands clasped to its ears and the third
     obscuring its mouth. George comes into the room and kisses
     his wife. She responds with cold indifference. You could cut
     the atmosphere with a knife. The woman hands George the
     newspaper. He knows what's up but tries to laugh it off. She
     doesn't find it funny, is as cold as stone and barely looks
     at him. She is obviously extremely annoyed with him. George
     picks up his dog and puts it on the table. Jack drops his
     head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her
     forgiveness. It's the exact expression of someone asking to
     be loved, but Doris is implacable. She gets up, walks away
     and does not turn back. Left on his own, George has a closed
     expression on his face. He seems unhappy to have hurt his
     wife's feelings. Then he realizes that Jack is on the table
     in a ridiculous pose, and signals to him to get down. The dog
     obeys. George looks at the paper, the cause of his problems.


13   EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET BUS - DAY                            13

     Thirteen white letters placed on a hillside.

     HOLLYWOODLAND.

     Below, in town, a bus.
                                                               7.


14   INT. BUS (DRIVING)/HOLLYWOOD - DAY                           14

     Inside the full bus is the young woman from the day before. Her
     name is Peppy Miller. She is proudly holding "The Hollywood
     Reporter" with her face on the front page, and is more or less
     discreetly making suggestive glances, hoping that someone
     recognizes her. But the people around her - from working and
     middle class backgrounds - are visibly on their way to work and
     remain impervious to her game.

     She - carefully - puts the paper away in her bag, in which four
     or five copies of the newspaper are already carefully tucked
     away, then gets off the bus at the next stop.


15   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 15

     She goes through the main gates of Kinograph Studios, and
     heads towards where they hire extras.

     In a courtyard, fifty-odd people are waiting, some sitting on
     wooden crates, others standing. There are mums with kids,
     guys with animals, men dressed as cowboys, etc. Peppy is
     among them, sitting next to a man of about sixty who is
     dressed in a highly stylized fashion. His job is obviously
     that of a butler. Peppy proudly shows him the picture in the
     newspaper. The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the
     newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back
     up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting
     the headline: Who's that girl ?

     Peppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place, but
     deep down she knows he's right. Nobody knows who she is. She
     puts the newspaper away.

     A man who visibly works for the studio, some assistant or
     other, comes into the courtyard, climbs on a crate and makes
     an announcement.

     Title card: Contemporary film!   Five girls who can dance!

     All the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels,
     leaving the assistant surrounded only by women. The man says
     something to one girl, who begins to dance. He motions to her
     that it's ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section.
     He does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too.
     Then it's Peppy's turn. She puts a lot of energy into a few
     top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent
     that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired.

     Full of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy
     heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she
     pauses in front of the butler.
                                                                  8.


      Title card: The name is Miller.    Peppy Miller!

      She finishes with an exaggerated wink, before walking on,
      leaving behind the impassive butler.


16A   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                            16A

      In the lobby, George is preparing to leave the house. He
      waves at the huge, full-length portrait of himself waving and
      smiling whilst wearing a tuxedo. He looks great in the
      painting, and George is delighted to see and to wave to
      himself.


16    EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 16

      Later, George, in a luxurious car driven by his chauffeur,
      arrives at the Kinograph studios with his dog. The guard at the
      entrance smiles broadly at them and waves.


17    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY       17

      As he walks towards his dressing room, everyone smiles at him.
      He's not always fooled by these signs of respect, and apes a
      few smiles himself.


18    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY        18

      In his dressing room, wearing a tailcoat and top hat, George
      is finishing putting his make up on. He has a white face and
      dark lips and eyes. His chauffeur is signing autographs for
      him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his
      dog. George says to him:

      Title card: Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice
      piece, to make it up to her.

      The chauffeur nods. Having finished his mask up, George,
      picks up a photo, looks at it closely and then writes on it.
      As he leaves the dressing room, we see the photograph. He's
      written Woof Woof on it, and signed it with the paw print of
      a dog.


19    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY          19

      We're on a film set, the crew is setting up a shot. The
      director is unhappy with a screen positioned behind a bay
      window and he sends it off.
                                                           9.


Title card: Remove that screen and bring me another one!    On
the double!

Two hands pick up the screen and carry it away. George
arrives on set, everyone smiles at him. He sits down on the
chair which bears his name. The producer whom we saw the
previous day at the première arrives. His name is Zimmer, and
he's flanked by - and followed around at every moment by -
two secretaries and two assistants. One of them hands him The
Hollywood Reporter, and Zimmer, before he's even come to a
halt, talks to George as he shows him the front page. He is
visibly upset. George looks a lot more relaxed, he says hello
and vaguely tries to reassure him. But Zimmer persists, still
pointing at the newspaper.

Title card: Because of this childish nonsense, there's
nothing about the film before page 5!

Behind George, the two set hands come back with a new screen
of sky scenery, and wait, standing just next to George. As
they are holding it, there is a three foot gap underneath.
While the producer is talking to him, George's attention is
drawn by a lovely pair of women's legs that have come to
stand behind the screen, the top half of the body being
hidden by it. George acknowledges the sight with a smile and
is about to bring his attention back to the on-going
discussion, when his attention is drawn away again by a
noise, that of the tap steps the female legs are making,
presumably as a warm up. George smiles in recognition and
responds with a few tap steps of his own. The women's legs
instantly stop, seem to think a moment and then answer back,
but with a jump in the complexity of the steps. A tap
dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs, until the set
hands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their
screen of scenery and walk off with it. The screen moves away
and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a
young woman. She pulls a face meaning 'Here I am!!' And of
course it's Peppy, except that she immediately realizes who
she is dealing with - visibly she wasn't expecting this at
all - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable.

Her joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject
apology, but George is roaring with laughter.

After a short pause, Zimmer makes the connection. He checks
the front page of the paper, and recognizes her!

Then he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower
her head, unable to reply. He gestures that she's fired and
for her to get out, and she starts to go, completely
distraught. She's just made a couple of steps when George
stops her and tells her to come back. Everyone is surprised,
most of all him. Zimmer can't believe it, and so doesn't
respond at first.
                                                              10.


     There's bad feeling between them, as though neither wanted
     this sudden conflict, but like it had always been there,
     tangible. Everyone on the set seems to be waiting for Zimmer
     to react, but to their surprise, after a long moment of
     hesitation, he walks away without saying a thing. Peppy looks
     at George gratefully, smiling, but seems a little preoccupied
     as though she might have made a mistake.

     Everyone on set gets back to work.


20   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY        20

     They're about to start shooting. The director is showing
     George what he has to do. The scene is happening in a cabaret
     restaurant. George has to cross a dance floor, but each time he
     is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to
     change dancing partner. George finds himself dancing with
     Peppy one moment, and in the arms of a very fat man the next,
     the director finds the gag hysterical. The scene is shot
     several times from three different angles. Each time, George
     dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport
     changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then,
     with time, less so. Then they become embarrassed, and then
     things get worse. We start the sequence again and again, to the
     sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the
     eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from
     the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. Ultimately, no
     flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious
     beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing.
     It's probably love.


21   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     21

     Later on, in the dressing room corridor, Peppy, holding an
     envelope, goes up to George's door. She knocks, waits for a
     reply, then enters. There's nobody there. She hesitates, not
     sure whether to leave or stay...


22   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      22

     Finally, she goes into the room and places the envelope
     addressed to George Valentin on the dresser. Then she
     attentively looks around the dressing room. She looks at the
     objects and photos and notices, hanging from a coat stand,
     George's jacket on a hanger, and his hat which sits on a hook
     above it. The way the clothes are disposed looks like George's
     silhouette, except that the clothes are empty. She goes over,
     strokes the jacket and little by little brings George to life
     through his clothes.
                                                              11.


     She puts her right hand into the sleeve and touches her own
     waist. As it's George's sleeve, she makes it look like his arm
     has come to life, as though George has come to life. Even more
     so since her left hand is stroking the jacket as though George
     were inside. She takes pleasure from the embrace and, when
     George comes into the room, she slowly removes her hand without
     any rush. George sees her, they look at each other. He closes
     the door but doesn't go over to her, instead going over to the
     mirror. He looks at her, she at him... He motions to her to
     approach. She does. He stares at her face for a while before he
     speaks.

     Title card: If you want to be an actress, you need to have
     something no one else has.

     He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her
     upper lip. She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. She
     likes it. She turns towards him and, quite naturally, folds
     into his arms. The dog watches them curiously with its head
     leaning to one side. They are probably about to kiss when
     George's chauffeur comes into the room and catches them.
     George swiftly moves aside and there is a moment of
     discomfort. The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a
     large and beautiful pearl necklace. George is intrigued by
     the necklace, and turns away from Peppy. She understands that
     George has his own life, that their embrace was just a stolen
     moment and slowly leaves, looking back at George as she does
     so. He does not look at her. She leaves the room. Once he has
     studied and necklace and is satisfied, George turns back
     towards Peppy but she is no longer there. The chauffeur exits
     the room.

     When he is alone, George looks at himself in the mirror. His
     expression shows that he things he is the stupidest man in
     the world. He mimes shooting himself in the temple with his
     fingers, but it's the dog which collapses into its play-dead
     pose.


23   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             23

     The next morning, he's having breakfast with his wife. The
     atmosphere is still dreadful but this time he's not making any
     effort either. He disdainfully watches Doris eat. She is
     cutting up strawberries using a knife and fork. George watches
     her, smiles and continues to watch. Except it's not Doris he's
     watching. Instead it's Peppy who's tucking into her food and
     talking and laughing vivaciously. George is with her with an
     expression of love on his face. He's laughing with her when,
     suddenly, reality bites. He's still sitting opposite Doris,
     and she's staring at him because she doesn't understand why he
     is laughing. She visibly finds him ridiculous. He stops
     laughing and breakfast carries on as normal.
                                                                 12.


24   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              24

     We see several quick sequences which indicate time passing:

     Breakfasts with George and Doris where the atmosphere is
     increasingly dreadful. Doris scribbles on photos of George in
     the press, draws on moustaches, large spectacles, etc.


25   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PIRATE/COWBOY/ETC. - DAY                 25

     Short extracts of George in various films, in which he portrays
     a pirate, then a cowboy, then William Tell, etc. We also see
     him in "Someday in July" in the sequence he shot with Peppy and
     the fat male dancer.


26   INT. MOVIE THEATER AUDIENCE, ETC. - DAY                       26

     Movie-goers reacting to the films, but the way the images are
     edited - cut with breakfast images - could mean they are
     reacting to them too.

     Among the audience is Peppy Miller. She's trying to
     concentrate fully on the film and is pushing away the handsome
     young man she's with, who is trying to kiss her. We see her
     later, at the movies again, but this time alone.


27   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PEPPY AS A SERVANT/DANCER/ETC. - DAY     27

     We see her playing some bit parts, maid, dancer, etc. Her roles
     seem to get a little bigger. We notice that she now wears the
     beauty spot that she'll keep forever.

     Her name climbs up the ranks in the title sequences of films,
     until it appears on its own.


28   INT. OFFICE - PEPPY/CONTRACT/1927 - DAY                       28

     We see her signing a contract in a small office, she seems
     happy.


29                                                                 29
     INT. OFFICE - GEORGE/ZIMMER/CONTRACT - DAY

     George signs a big contract with Zimmer as photographers take
     pictures. He smiles broadly, whereas Zimmer looks like his
     smile is a little forced.

     The date appears on the screen: 1929
                                                                13.


30                                                                30
     INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR - DAY

     George, dressed as a musketeer, is sword-fighting with three
     middle-ages thugs in a tavern. He kills two of them, but
     unfortunately loses his epee when fighting the third. But when
     the third man attacks, George merely dodges with a sleight of
     body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook!
     Calm restored, he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a
     mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape.
     The man stands up, throws aside his cape and reveals himself to
     be... Napoleon! He puts his bicorne hat back on and warmly
     thanks an astonished George. Napoleon says something to him
     and George respectfully bows, walks away from him still bowing
     then turns and runs. Once out of the decor, he bumps right into
     a worried-looking Zimmer who is followed by his loyal
     assistants. George is in a playful mood. Zimmer tells him:

     Title Card: I want to show you something.     Right now.

     George seems astonished that Zimmer is leaving the set and
     not filming, but agrees. Napoleon walks past them very
     imperially and gestures royally to a technician to bring him
     a chair. The technician doesn't miss the chance to remind the
     man that he is only an extra, and not Napoleon.


31                                                                31
     INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

     Zimmer, his guards, and George - still dressed as a musketeer -
     come into a screening room in which a dozen or so very serious-
     looking people are waiting. They sit down and Zimmer, very
     proudly and self-confidently, gestures to an assistant who
     passes on the message to the projectionist. The room goes dark.
     The screening begins.


32                                                                32
     INT. VOICE TEST STUDIO - DAY

     On screen we see a card that indicates it's a sound shooting
     test for a talking scene. Then Constance appears, the actress
     from the spy film. She's standing in front of a mic and she
     tests it, delighted to be there. Cut. We see her again, the
     microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene. It's a
     monologue. Her acting is terrible, very theatrical, but the
     audience can hear her. It is however, awful.

     (31) In the screening room, the audience seems stunned by
     what they see/hear. They are fascinated. They then begin to
     congratulate each other and slap Zimmer on the back. Zimmer's
     pride seems to grow by the second.

     George, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a
     snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the
     actress earnestly ends her monologue.
                                                              14.


     When the lights come up, George is laughing uncontrollably
     way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is
     obvious. The people present are embarrassed, and Zimmer is
     deeply put out. George, still laughing, leaves the room,
     waving an apology with his hands as he goes, but also
     pointing to the screen to explain why he's laughing. Zimmer
     feels even more humiliated. Fade to black on his face.


33   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      33

     We're back with George in his dressing room. He's removing his
     make up. He moves some ordinary object and the object, as he
     moves it, makes a noise. We hear the noise it makes. Really
     hear it. It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes
     from within the film itself. One second later, George realizes
     that the object made a noise. He moves it again, the object
     makes a noise again. George is worried. He tries another object
     and obtains noise again. His dog barks and we hear it! He gets
     up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog, but no
     sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks. He realizes
     this... Panic sets in, he turns to the mirror and tries talking
     again, but still no sound comes out. Not understanding what's
     happening, the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his
     dressing room!


34   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     34

     Noisy, laughing dancers pass in the corridor, others are
     talking or shouting and even if we can't make out what they are
     saying, they are all making sound. George tries to talk to them
     but his voice remains silent. One dancer, seeing his fright,
     bursts into throaty laughter. George rushes through the
     milling crowd the sound of which is becoming increasingly
     loud...


35   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - COURTYARD - DAY                   35

     ...and bursts out into the courtyard of the studio that is now
     suddenly deserted and silent. In front of him a feather eddies
     slowly to the ground, carried by the breeze. It finally lands,
     making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like
     that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion.
     George screams, but again his cry is silent.


36   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT               36

     George awakes with a start! He's in bed and is having trouble
     shaking off his nightmare.

     The film continues as normal: in other words, silent.
                                                               15.


     His wife is sleeping by his side. He gets up, taking care not
     to make a sound.


37   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            37

     George calms down as he sits in the living room, alone in the
     darkness. Jack, still sleepy, has just curled into a ball
     next to him to fall back to sleep. George smiles and gives
     him a pat.


38   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY     38

     Driven by his chauffeur, George crosses town heading for the
     studios.


39                                                               39
     EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY

     The car goes through the studio gates. There's nobody there.
     George gets out. He goes into the courtyard. There's nobody
     there either.


40   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR SET - DAY             40

     He goes into the studio and heads for the set. There is still
     no one about. He doesn't understand and goes back outside.


41   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                41

     Outside in the deserted courtyard, a feather eddies towards
     the ground, carried by the breeze. George is watching it drift
     to the ground when suddenly a gust of wind sends it soaring
     back into the sky. George follows it with his eyes and notices
     a man crossing between two sets. He looks like some kind of set
     hand or assistant; a working man in any case. George calls to
     him. The two men draw close and George asks him what's
     happening. The man takes the day's newspaper out of his pocket
     and hands it to George before walking off. George reads:
     Kinograph Studios stop all silent productions to work
     exclusively on talkies.


42   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY           42

     Despite the secretary's attempts to stop him, a furious George
     storms into Zimmer's office.
                                                              16.


43   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY                43

     Zimmer is in a meeting with some men. They are probably
     engineers in view of the attention being given to the plans
     lying on the desk. Everyone is surprised by George's rude
     entry. The engineers seem embarrassed, but Zimmer smiles and
     politely asks them to leave, as though asking for their
     understanding. As they head for the door, some of them drop
     their heads so as not to meet George's eyes, whereas others
     look him right between the eyes but without any love lost. This
     exchange causes a strange, unpleasant feeling within him. He
     seems embarrassed. It's perhaps due to the rudeness of his
     eruption into the office, but it's more likely due to the looks
     he's been given. For the first time for ages, he has not been
     looked at how a star is normally looked at - with respect,
     desire and admiration - but like any ordinary man is looked at
     or, worse still, how a superfluous man is looked at.

     As George realizes that his status has just changed, Zimmer
     invites him to sit down. Then speaks to him, in a friendly
     manner.

     Title card: We belong to another age, you and I, George.
     Nowadays, the world talks.

     He talks to him, looks a little embarrassed, while George
     takes it on the chin, not knowing how to respond.

     Title card: People want to see new faces. Talking faces.

     George reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to
     bring up a smile.

     Title card: Paramount will be delighted. They still want me.

     Zimmer responds with a pursing of the lips that is more
     damning than any counter argument could be. As though he's
     telling George he can always give it a go... George understands
     what's happening. Zimmer is sorry.

     Title card: I'm sorry. The public wants fresh blood. And the
     public is never wrong.

     George gets to his feet.

     Title card: It's me the people want and it's my films they
     want to see. And I'm going to give them to them.

     Zimmer nods with another pursing of the lips, as though he
     can't wait to see that. George seems very sure of himself.

     Title card: I don't need you. Go make your talking movies.
     I'm going to make them a beautiful film!
                                                              17.


     As George leaves in disgust, his eyes are drawn to an
     advertising feature representing the "new faces of Kinograph
     Studios". Among the medallion framed young portraits, George
     recognizes that of Peppy Miller. He glances up at Zimmer.

     Title card: Fresh blood...

     The two men exchange a last glance, then George exits.


44   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS, SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY            44

     Outside he feels a few seconds of discouragement but, as he
     meets the gaze of the engineers waiting in the secretary's
     antechamber, he puffs up his chest and walks tall out of the
     office.


45   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - STAIRS - DAY                       45

     Going down the stairs from the offices, he passes a laughing
     Peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men, perfect
     specimens of America's golden youth. She is coming up, he is
     going down. When she notices him, she stops, already one step
     above of him. She has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to
     see him. He is delighted too, although his mood is very
     different.

     Title card (him): How are you?

     Title card (her): Fantastic! I've been given a lead role!
     Isn't it wonderful?!

     He nods, we see in his eyes that he's terribly happy for her.
     They look at each other, she laughs.

     Then she fumbles in her bag for something with which to note
     down her telephone number on a piece of paper. It takes a
     while and is a little chaotic, she apologizes, but he visibly
     takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her. She finally gets
     the number down and hands it to him, telling him to call her -
     to really call her. In response he casts a glance over to the
     young men waiting for her higher up the stairs, and she
     bursts out laughing. She leans towards him to say something.

     Title card: Gadgets!

     She looks at him flirtatiously. Then she gestures again for
     him to call her, and he nods, even though we think that he
     probably will not do so. She leaves and he watches her go
     before beginning his decent once more. Once at the top, she
     turns back to call out to George, he too has turned to look.
     She smiles at him, breaks into a few tap steps for old time's
     sake, then blows him a kiss.
                                                              18.


     He catches the kiss with a smile, pretends to make it
     disappear in his other hand like a magician, then shows her
     the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that he's
     keeping it safe and warm. She laughs loudly and goes on her
     way. He watches her walk away with admiration in his eyes.
     She vanishes and George's smile takes on a note of
     melancholy, and then he leaves too.

47   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           47

     George comes home. Doris is there scribbling on a magazine but
     he takes no notice of her. When the dog jumps into his arms
     however, he greets it affectionately. Doris is vexed.


48   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY             48

     A while later he's running Jack through his tricks when Doris
     arrives.

     Title card: We have to talk, George.

     George smiles.

     Title card: Or not.

     She insists but he doesn't listen. He's with his dog. She
     gets annoyed, he doesn't answer, she ends up throwing Jack.
     George cannot forgive her for doing so, he looks at her in
     disgust. She starts to cry.

     Title card: I'm unhappy, George.

     He answers without looking at her.

     Title card: So are millions of other people, me for instance.


49   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              49

     Thanks to a montage of shot frames, photos and press cuttings,
     we see George begin making his film, the first clap of the
     board that shows he's both the film's producer and director.
     The film is called Tears of love, and it tells the tale of an
     English adventurer - played by himself - accompanied by a young
     woman, an old man who looks like a professor and who is
     probably the father of the young woman and, lastly, an African
     tribe represented as savages and whose humanity remains to be
     proven.
                                                              19.


     We see George in the various stages of preparation: writing, re-
     writing, directing, acting, signing a lot of checks, but also
     leaving very early in the morning to set up shots with his
     collaborators, etc. He looks fulfilled, like he truly believes
     in what he's doing, despite the tiredness he's feeling. His dog
     has a role in the film too, doing tricks. George looks very
     happy, very committed. He takes a supple branch, feeds it
     through the sleeves of a woman's blouse and, by holding the two
     ends of the branch out in front of him, dances with the
     imaginary woman. Everyone around him is happy and laughing.
     He's not shooting a comedy, however, it's obviously a drama of
     some sort from what we see of the set and the way the actors
     play their role.

     Then appear on screen the mock ups of posters, they are shown
     on the set to George.

     He chooses the one in which he is most prominent, it's a poster
     depicting a cutesy melodrama and bears the release date
     October 25th.


50                                                              50
     OMITTED


51   EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET (POSTERS) - DAY                    51

     In the street, at the entrance to a movie theater, George sees
     a large "Beauty Spot" film poster. The poster shows Peppy close
     up, wearing a magnificent and jauntily positioned chapka over
     one eye. She is incredibly stylish but in no way vampish, more
     the image of a young comedy debut... George looks at her, Peppy
     seems to be smiling at him. He smiles back. Then his smile
     becomes strained. He's noticed something. The two theater
     employees are sticking a banner over the poster that reveals
     the release date of Beauty Spot - it's also October 25th.


52   INT. ANIMATION STAND - DAY                                 52

     Then we see advertising inserts and full page press articles
     appearing one after the other, creating a montage of images
     with a very 1920's feel. "Get some Peps with Peppy!" and a
     close up on her smiling, mischievous face. "The girl next
     door", "The girl you'll love to love" "Young and pretty", etc.
     with a photo of Peppy each time, posters of the film and then,
     everywhere, the face that it's a talking movie! Talking,
     talking, talking!

     As for George, his image is a lot more austere, the photographs
     show him as very serious. And the captions are like: "I'm not a
     muppet anymore, I'm an artist!"
                                                              20.

54   INT. RESTAURANT INTERVIEW - DAY                              54

     We're in a smart restaurant. George has his back to the room
     and is eating with his chauffeur. Peppy comes into the
     restaurant and comes to sit just behind George. They are back
     to back. She is with several young men, two of whom are
     journalists and they are interviewing her.

     Title card: Your first film doesn't come out until tomorrow
     and yet you're already the new darling of Hollywood! How do
     you explain that?

     She starts by bursting into laughter, which draws George's
     attention. He turns round to listen to the rest of Peppy's
     answer.

     Title card: I don't know, maybe it's because I talk. And
     people hear me.

     She continues talking, obviously happy that people are
     interested in her. She doesn't see George smiling behind her.

     Title card: People are sick to death of those old actors who
     pull faces to make themselves understood.

     She continues talking with the casual arrogance of youth.
     Behind her, George's smile vanishes.

     Title card: Anyway, it's normal for the young to take over
     from the old, that's life. Make way for youth!

     George is hurt. He gets up and, before he leaves, gestures
     silently that if she wants his place all she has to do is
     take it. She watches him leave and immediately regrets what
     she's just said.


55   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             55

     It's the day of the films' release, October 25th.

     It's morning. George opens his front door. His chauffeur is
     outside. The man's expression announces bad news. He's holding
     the day's press. The huge headlines talk of a stock market
     crash, a black Thursday, a catastrophe.

     Dressed in a robe, George is on the telephone in the living
     room. He nods. The atmosphere is stifling. He hangs up. His
     chauffeur looks at him inquisitively. George replies as though
     lost in thought:
                                                              21.


     Title card: It would seem that we're ruined.

     The chauffeur takes it on the chin with as much reserve as he
     can muster, but George continues.

     Title card: That's the best case scenario...

     He almost laughs - not so the chauffeur.


56   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           56

     Now wearing a suit, George is sitting at his desk. Lying in
     front of him are the front pages of newspapers reporting the
     Crash. He looks for something on the inside pages of one paper
     and reads. Next to a large picture of Peppy there's a review of
     his own film, beginning "Tears of Love, Old and Boring". He
     shuts the paper and searches for something in the drawer of his
     desk. He takes out a piece of paper. It's the telephone number
     that Peppy had scribbled down for him. He looks at it, moves
     closer to the telephone, hesitates, looks at the paper again,
     then puts the scrap of paper back in the drawer without making
     the call.


57   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                         57

     Peppy awakes in bed with a start. She doesn't know what has
     woken her up. She looks around, looks at the phone, seems
     perplexed. Then a man's arm invites her to lie back down; she
     does.

     (56) Still at his desk, George gets up and goes to the
     window. He seems lost in thought.


58   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              58

     An extract from "Tears of Love" in which we see George, holding
     the young woman in his arms, take part in a cliché-d African
     dance with shields, spears and all the African accoutrements
     attributed by Westerners at the time. George and the woman are
     complacently watching the dance, when George says to the young
     woman.

     Title card: Let's go back, Norma. They've never seen a white
     woman before and I don't want to take any risks.


59   INT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" SCREENING - DAY       59

     There's hardly anyone in the theater. The people that are there
     look bored more than anything. At the back smoking a cigarette,
     George takes the failure on the chin.
                                                               22.


     One couple gets to their feet and leaves the theater. As the
     man reaches George, he recognizes him and casts him a glance
     that seems to say "goodness old chap this one's not up to
     much..." George doesn't know what to say in reply.


60   EXT. MOVIE THEATERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                       60

     Outside, George comes out still smoking his cigarette. On the
     sidewalk, people are cheerfully waiting in line. George walks
     up the line and comes to a movie house that's playing the
     "Beauty Spot" talking movie. A huge poster depicts Peppy and
     the people in the line seem excited and delighted to be going
     to see the film. It's visibly a success. George takes it on the
     chin.


61   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY       61

     Inside the car, behind the implacable chauffeur, George is
     talking to himself, as though he's re-running the story in
     his head and searching for what he might have done better, or
     differently.


62   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              62

     Once home, he finds a photo of himself on the floor. It has
     been defaced with a scribbled moustache, spectacles and a big
     nose. There's a note to him scribbled on the back. We read it
     at the same time as him.

     It's over, George. You've got a fortnight to collect your
     souvenirs together and get out of the house.

     Doris
     P.S.: You should go see Beauty Spot, it's incredible.

     George takes it on the chin and leaves, revealing behind him
     the portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo, smiling and waving.


63   INT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" SCREENING - DAY          63

     As for Peppy, she's in the theater, watching Tears of love.
     She's with a handsome young man who seems bored.


64   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                             64

     George is wearing shorts and an explorer's hat. He is sinking
     in sinking sand. The young woman is screaming and the dog
     barking.
                                                                23.


     The Africans are panicking but there's nothing anyone can do.
     George stops struggling, and looks deep into the eyes of the
     young woman. He says gently:

     Title card: Farewell, Norma.    I never loved you...

     It's obvious he's only saying that so that she can forget him
     and move on with her life, but it doesn't wash and the young
     woman weeps all the more, terribly moved by this last
     sacrifice on his part.

     (63) In the balcony, Peppy is speechless and her face
     impassive.

     (64) On screen, George and the young women exchange a last
     glance as George's face gradually sinks into the sand.

     (63) Next to Peppy, the young man sits watching her. She sees
     sad.

     (64) On screen, George has disappeared into the mire. Only
     one hand stays in the air for several seconds more in a
     tortured pose, that of a dying man trying to hold on to the
     wind.

     (63) Peppy's companion seems to find the film far too long
     and doesn't understand why they haven't already left.

     (64) The hand has disappeared. The young woman is in a state
     of shock, rigid with a look of horror on her face. She is no
     doubt about to be put to certain death. The dog turns round
     and walks off with head and tail lowered...

     The End appears on the screen.

     (63) Peppy seems moved. She is shaking her head from side to
     side.


65   EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - PICTURE OF GEORGE - EVENING        65

     Evening has fallen on the town. It's raining. On the ground
     lies an old page from a newspaper that bears a picture of
     George. A man's feet trample the picture.


66   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - NIGHT                           66

     George is   at home. Two bottles are apparent and, obviously
     drunk, he   is staring out the window. The projection of
     raindrops   sliding down the window look like tears running down
     his face.   And Jack's face too. George is pulled out of his
     stupor as   he hears something.
                                                              24.


67   EXT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - TOP STEP - NIGHT                 67

     He opens the door. It's Peppy. She immediately notices that
     George is drunk. Her smile tenses a little.

     Title card: I wanted to talk, I...

     George looks at her. She continues.

     Title card: I saw Tears of Love.

     George nods, and answers.

     Title card: And so you've come to get your money back?

     She smiles stiffly, not knowing how to react.   He continues.

     Title card: Too much face-pulling?

     She stops smiling because it's not funny at all. It's bitter,
     even. There's an embarrassed silence. Softly, she tries to
     explain.

     Title card: About last night...

     She stops because George is not looking at her anymore. He's
     watching the arrival of the young, smiling, handsome and
     wholesome man who is with Peppy. George bears a melancholy
     smile.

     Title card: You're right. Make way for youth...

     The young man shakes George's hand. He's obviously a nice
     lad, and very polite.

     Title card: I'm so happy to meet you. My Dad just loves you.

     He says it very nicely, with no ulterior motive, but George
     is cut to the quick. The comment wounds him and Peppy
     notices. She cuts short the meeting by smiling and upping the
     cheerfulness stakes, as though to kid George she hasn't
     noticed any embarrassment or perceived anything that might
     have shocked or hurt him during their encounter.

     Title card: OK! Well, we'll be off now.   I'll call you soon.
     Bye!

     George smiles politely. She leaves, taking the handsome jock
     with her. George watches them leave. As does his dog, who
     sits with his head and ears hanging low as though very
     disappointed. George watches Peppy walking away, then steps
     forwards and sits down on the steps leading up to the house.
                                                              25.


     As she gets into the car, Peppy seems surly, unhappy even,
     for the first time. She turns her back on her companion.

     Title card: Take me home. I'd like to be alone.

     George watches the car leave, then goes and sits on a bench
     next to the front door. But the bench breaks and George finds
     himself on the ground next to the dog. George remarks evenly
     to Jack:

     Title card: See, could be it just wasn't my day...

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.


68   EXT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" - DAY                    68

     In the rain, a worker is taking down letters from the facade
     of a theater. Of Tears of Love, only the word Tears remains.


69   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          69

     Peppy is facing her mirror and putting her make up on. She
     takes a break, looking a little sad. Someone (some kind of
     assistant) opens the door to her dressing room and says
     something like you need to hurry up. She nods and gets back
     to work.


70   EXT. MOVIE POSTERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                        70

     Alternate shots of three or four film posters and frames from
     them which illustrate Peppy's rising fame. Her name moves
     higher up the posters and into bigger letters. The films are
     called "The Rookie", "The Brunette ", "The Girl Next Door" and,
     finally, "On the Roof ".


71                                                                 71
     OMITTED


72   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          72

     We catch up with her in a close up, applying her make up. The
     camera pulls back and we see that not only is she not putting
     the make up on herself - a make up artist is doing that - but
     there are in fact four pairs of hands getting busy around her;
     two make up girls, a hairdresser and a wardrobe assistant.
     Peppy, fortunately, has stayed completely natural and doesn't
     seem to take any of it seriously. As the last touch is put in
     place, Peppy gets to her feet and turns round.
                                                              26.


     At her feet lie a dozen pairs of shoes, each pair as
     magnificent as the next, and all in their swanky boxes. Peppy
     tries on a pair. Close up of her feet.


73   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE (1931) - DAY                              73

     Crossfade to a man's pair of shoes with used heels and uppers.
     George's dog comes to sit at his feet. The date is superimposed
     on the screen: 1931.

     The camera climbs up his legs to reveal George lying fully
     dressed in his bed, obviously at home in view of his attitude.
     He's changed. And even if his suit is still pretty smart, he's
     become more "common", less unattainable. He seems to have lost
     whatever it was that made him so superb. Primarily he's a bit
     drunk, somewhat hesitant. George gets up and closes his Murphy
     bed, the kind of bed that slots up into the wall to look like a
     closet. Then he walks across the living area. His home has
     changed too, it's fallen in class and is a lot more modest than
     the one we were used to seeing him in. We do however recognize
     some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old
     house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling. He goes into
     the kitchen which is open onto the rest of the apartment.
     There's nothing in the refrigerator. He looks for something to
     drink but there's only one bottle left in the rack. He lifts it
     up. It's empty.

     He opens a closet. Inside, a tuxedo hangs among a number of
     bare hangers.


74   INT. PAWNSHOP - DAY                                           74

     In a pawnshop, George, still a little drunk, is selling his
     tuxedo. The pawnbroker and he are visibly disagreeing on the
     price, but of course it's George who folds first and hands
     over the tuxedo. The pawnbroker counts out the bills and
     hands them to George who, in a fit of pride, leaves a tip as
     he leaves - his dignity intact even in the face of adversity.


75   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     75

     At home, George is drinking and watching his chauffeur fix some
     food. He seems preoccupied.

     Title card: How long's it been since I paid you last,
     Clifton?

     The chauffeur answers as he carries on doing what he's doing.

     Title card: Been one year now, Sir.
                                                              27.


     George gets up, visibly thinking that he shouldn't have done
     that, that it's wrong. He go gets the keys and a jacket,
     comes back and gives them to the chauffeur.

     Title card: You're fired. Keep the car. Get yourself a job
     someplace else.

     The chauffeur refuses, George insists. They don't agree but
     George ends up throwing him out, even though we've understood
     that he's doing it for Clifton's benefit and not through any
     unkindness.


76   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     76

     Once outside, the chauffeur doesn't move. He stays next to the
     car. George watches him through the window. The chauffeur
     still doesn't budge. George pulls the curtains.


77   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - EVENING                                 77

     In the evening, George looks out between the curtains, the
     chauffeur is still there. George turns on his heels and gets
     into his Murphy bed.


78   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                         78

     Night time. George is in bed with his eyes open.


79   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   79

     Outside, the chauffeur is still in the same position.


80   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     80

     The next morning, George gets up and goes to look from the
     window. The chauffeur has gone. George is a little sad, but
     that's just the way it is... He looks around at his home.

     A little later, George looks at himself in a mirror. We pass
     from him to his reflection, which he hides by placing his drink
     against the mirror.


81   INT. AUCTION ROOMS - DAY                                      81

     A sign says that the effects of George Valentin are to be
     auctioned. Furniture, costumes, objets d'art and paintings on
     September 14th. There aren't many people in the room, just five
     or six. George is standing at the back, smoking a cigarette.
                                                              28.


     His position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching
     the screening of Tears of Love, from the back of the room with
     the verdict of failure in the air...

     He's looking a little unsteady on his feet, probably due to the
     hip flask he's necking that seems to contain liquor. The
     objects go under the hammer one by one. We see the three
     monkeys go by, notably, hear no evil, speak no evil, see no
     evil. Two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding
     against each other, a distinguished and reserved-looking man,
     and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe, to the
     point of bigotry. They don't seem perfectly comfortable, but
     they are the only two buying.

     A few crossfades (the display table emptying, faces, hands
     being raised, hammer falling, "sold" labels) show us the lots
     disappearing - every single item is sold.


82   INT. AUCTION ROOMS - CORRIDOR - DAY                           82

     George is now with the auctioneer, he's studying the list of
     items as auction assistants busy themselves around him,
     carrying and packing the sold lots. The auctioneer, who is
     putting on his coat, congratulates George.

     Title card: Well done! It all sold, there's nothing left!

     George nods but his smile seems a little ironic. He leaves
     the room.

     On the stairway, as he's leaving, he is joined by the
     distinguished-looking man who puts on his coat and leaves.


83   EXT. AUCTION ROOM'S STREET - DAY                              83

     They leave at the same time. The man crosses the street, we
     follow him.

     He gets into a car. Peppy is sitting in the back. She's alone
     and watching George walk off with his unsteady gait. She's sad.
     The man casts a glance to ask her what he should do next.
     Peppy, with a forced smile, motions that they can leave. As the
     man starts up the motorcar, George is walking away. The car
     sets off and overtakes him. Peppy does not turn round. She's
     crying.


84   INT. CLANDESTINE BAR - NIGHT                                  84

     George, dressed differently, is drinking in a clandestine bar
     that has made the effort of putting up a few Christmas
     decorations. George is visibly smashed.
                                                              29.


85   INT. STUDIO JUNGLE ENCRUSTED LITTLE GEORGE - NIGHT            85

     A small version of him appears superimposed on the bar, dressed
     as an explorer and discovering the life-size version of
     himself. The big version watches the little version load his
     rifle. Then the little version shoots at the big version, but
     the big version just smiles.

     Little version runs off shot to get help, and he comes back
     with a tribe of African warriors, all bearing spears. They
     attack.

     Big version tries to defend himself, staggers as he gets to his
     feet, tries to gesture to the barman, but he is so drunk that
     he falls straight backwards without making the slightest
     attempt to stop his fall. The Africans leap about with joy.

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

     (84) George's chauffeur comes into the bar. He motions to the
     barman who jerks his head in one direction. The chauffeur
     follows the indication and finds George lying on the floor,
     totally smashed. He slaps him gently around the face a few
     times in a vain attempt to wake him, then lifts him over his
     shoulder, pays the check and leaves.


86   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   86

     At George's house, his chauffeur puts him to bed and hangs his
     suit carefully before leaving the room. He sees the dog, goes
     over to it and strokes it. They look at each other. We can tell
     that the chauffeur is worried about George.


87   EXT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - DAY                           87

     Peppy Miller is "The Guardian Angel". It's a huge poster on the
     façade of a movie theater. George goes inside. With Jack.


88   INT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - DAY                           88

     The auditorium is full. George sits down in the first row. To
     watch the film he has to look upwards, and sees a huge and
     magnificent Peppy rising above him. She's playing a scene with
     a young actor we recognize, it's Humphrey Bogart. He's become a
     spectator: he laughs, is absorbed and cries along with the
     others.
                                                               30.


89   INT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - CORRIDOR & LOBBY - DAY       89

     Coming out of the theater several young people bump into him.
     They don't recognize him. There's a lot of people milling
     about, so he picks Jack up. A woman exclaims an Oh! of
     admiration as though she's recognized George. He smiles
     modestly but soon realizes that it's just because she thinks
     Jack is cute and has come over to stroke him like she would any
     other dog. She is totally under Jack's charm, and says to
     George.

     Title card: If only he could talk!

     George still has the smile on his lips, but it has become one
     of resignation.

     He looks away as the woman strokes the dog.


90   EXT. MEXICAN VILLAGE - DAY                                   90

     George is playing Zorro. He performs stunt after stunt and the
     close ups show his devastating smile to its best advantage. In
     fact, it's an extract from The Mark of Zorro with Douglas
     Fairbanks, into which we'll insert close ups of Jean we've shot
     ourselves.


91   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    91

     The Zorro sequence is being screened on a wall in George's
     apartment. George is watching himself, slumped in an easy
     chair. His sluggish attitude and listless air are in sharp
     contrast with the image of himself projected by the film.

     Then the image jumps and goes white. George gets up, still half-
     smashed. His shadow is clearly delineated on the white screen.
     He sees it, looks it up and down and then starts to look at it
     sideways.

     Title card: Look what you've become...

     He carries on shouting at it, obviously very annoyed with it.

     Title card: You were very nasty! And stupid! And arrogant!

     He doesn't even want to look at it anymore. He looks
     disgusted. Suddenly his shadow separates itself from him and
     moves independently from him. As he shouts at it, it lowers
     its head and doesn't reply.

     Title card: You acted very badly! You were thoughtless!
                                                               31.


     He carries on as though it's normal until his shadow walks
     off with its head bowed. He watches it go, trying to
     understand what's happening, but it's gone and he's still
     there. He begins to holler.

     Title card: COME BACK! COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!

     Totally smashed he starts to violently throw film reels
     against the wall as he hollers. The cans split open and the
     film bursts out all over. George is becoming more and more
     frenzied. The floor is now covered in cans and film. He
     stops, dripping with sweat. Worriedly, he looks around for a
     moment. Then he strikes a match, takes a second to consider
     what he's about to do and throws the match into the middle of
     the reels.

     There's madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold.
     We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread. But he's
     very quickly overrun. The reels burst into flames in an
     instant and give off lots of smoke. Jack is panicking and
     barks incessantly. Suddenly, George seems to lose it. He
     doesn't know what to do anymore and, although the fire is
     spreading quite spectacularly around him, he runs to where
     the reels and films that he has not opened are, and begins
     throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though he's
     looking for one in particular. The ever-increasing denseness
     of the smoke, however, is making the task almost impossible.
     On the floor, below the smoke, Jack flees the room and runs
     off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with
     the cans of reels.


92   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    92

     The dog comes out of the house and makes a dash for the
     sidewalk as fast as he can.

     (91) In the room, among the flames and the smoke, George -
     now breathless - picks one of the reels and tries to turn
     round. He collapses, still holding on to the can.


93   EXT. POLICEMAN JUNCTION - DAY                                93

     Jack spots a cop at a junction. He takes hold of the cop's
     trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards
     George's house. The policeman doesn't understand, however, and
     pushes it away with his foot. The dog persists and barks but
     the cop just wants to be left in peace.

     (91) George is suffocating on the floor. The level of smoke
     is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face.
                                                              32.


     (93) Jack barks louder and louder. The policeman feels
     uncomfortable. A woman is watching the scene inquisitively.
     Not knowing what to do, the cop motions to the dog to be
     silent and threatens it with two fingers, just like George
     miming a pistol. Jack collapses and plays dead. The cop has
     no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog
     to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but
     stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with
     him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who
     tells him what he must do. The cop seems to understand, has a
     moment of doubt, and then starts following the dog. Jack
     encourages him to go faster, but the cop resists to begin
     with. Little by little though, as though realizing the
     seriousness of the situation, he speeds up. More and more,


94   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    94

     until he finally arrives flat out at George's home. The cop
     sees the smoke coming out of the house. He runs into the smoke.


95   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    95

     A completely unconscious George, overcome by the fumes, is
     dragged out of the fire by the policeman.


96   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    96

     They come out the house. George is still clutching the reel. A
     crowd has formed, people recognize him. One woman feels sorry
     for him, a man runs for help. George is unconscious.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.


97   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY              97

     We see Peppy on a shoot, sitting in a chair with her name on
     it, smoking a cigarette. Everyone about her is busy preparing a
     shot. Suddenly an assistant brings her a telephone. She takes
     the receiver with a smile and listens. Her expression tightens
     a little. She hangs up, pensive for a moment. On set,the
     director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and
     they are good to go. The assistant goes towards Peppy to let
     her know but, as he gets to where she should be, her seat is
     empty. He looks everywhere for her, but she has disappeared.


98   INT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                             98

     In her car, and still in costume, she urges her chauffeur to go
     quick as he can.
                                                                 33.


99    EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - DAY                                99

      The car pulls into the hospital courtyard.


100   INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY AND STAIRS - DAY                      100

      Peppy bursts into the lobby, talks to a woman at the desk who
      directs her with a raised hand that Peppy immediately follows.

      She bounds up the stairs four at a time and comes into a
      corridor,


101   INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR AND GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY            101

      and then to a door through the window of which she sees
      George lying down. His dog is at the foot of the bed, asleep.
      George is on a drip, unconscious and covered in bandages. A
      doctor is in the room with a nurse.

      Peppy enters. She's anxious but the doctor seems reassuring.

      Title card: He's not in any danger now. He just needs to
      rest.

      Peppy goes up to George. She notices that his burnt hands
      seem to still be clutching something. She's intrigued. In
      response, the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in
      a corner of the room.

      Title card: He was holding that. It was real hard to pry it
      away from him.

      Peppy picks up the can. The label is too damaged to be able
      to read the title of the film. She opens it and unrolls some
      of the film in front of the window. We see random photograms
      run by. It's the only sequence they ever shot together, years
      before. Peppy is moved. Without turning round, she asks the
      doctor:

      Title card: Do you think he could come rest up at my place?

      The doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye.

      Title card: It's probably the very best he could have hoped
      for.


102   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    102

      An ambulance takes George, still unconscious, to Peppy's
      house. Jack is with him.
                                                                 34.


      It's a large, beautiful house, very expensive and very
      Hollywood. But it's also very inviting.


103   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM & CORRIDOR - NIGHT    103

      It's night time. George is in bed. He opens one eye. Then he
      wakes up and looks around, not understanding where he is.

      Jack wakes up and barks, wags his tail. A nurse who had been
      dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start, then
      goes over to George. She reassures him, motions to him not to
      get upset, then slowly leaves the room before running off down
      the corridor. She knocks at a door then goes back to George's
      room. Peppy is close on her heels. She comes into the room in
      her nightgown. When he sees her, George smiles and she rushes
      over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him. She is
      terribly moved but, when she releases him from her arms to talk
      to him, she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and
      so was not sharing the same special moment as she. She pulls a
      face, afraid she might have done something wrong, glances over
      at the nurse, then lays George's head back on his pillow.


104   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                 104

      The next morning, Peppy brings breakfast into George's room
      and they eat it together. She laughs, talks, eats, drinks and
      is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years
      before. He looks at her with a smile on his face. Then she
      looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry.

      Title card: I've got to go. I have to be on set for nine
      o'clock.

      George smiles kindly at her. She returns the smile but we can
      tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is
      working, and he is not. They exchange a last glance before
      she leaves the room.

      George, now alone, gets up with some difficulty. He picks up
      a pile of folded clothes from an armchair. It's his jacket
      and pants, both half burned. On the floor, his shoes are in
      exactly the same state of disrepair.


105   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    105

      A little later, and alone, he's exploring the house. It's
      richly and tastefully decorated, highly personal. He goes
      along a corridor and down a wide stairway. Jack begins sniffing
      outside of one door, as though he wants to go inside.
                                                               35.


106   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                        106

      George opens the door and goes into the room, it's a kind of
      storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets. He
      closes the door behind him. The room has a ghostly quality to
      it. Jack sniffs about everywhere. George too seems troubled by
      the strange pervading atmosphere. His curiosity is spurred by
      a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. A ray of
      light surges into the room. The door has opened and, standing
      against the daylight, is a maid.

      Title card: You should go back to your room, Sir.

      George nods with a smile. The maid leaves pretty swiftly, we
      haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange.
      George is intrigued but leaves the room. He has to call Jack
      to him. Jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master.


107   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY             107

      A screenplay lies on a table. Peppy and Zimmer are seated
      either side of the table and are talking animatedly. We're on
      the set we saw the previous day, and Peppy seems to be trying
      to convince Zimmer of something. She seems to be describing a
      film poster or the façade of a movie theater she'd love to see.
      He doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative
      shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to
      Peppy. She finally stops talking and gives him a determined
      look. Zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies.

      Title card: George is a silent movie actor. He belongs to the
      past. Today he's a nobody.

      As Zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat.
      Zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking.

      Title card: What are you doing?

      She looks him straight in the eyes, and answers:

      Title card: I'm stopping work. It's him or me.

      She looks determined. He's looking unsure of himself. He
      visibly isn't sure he's understood properly. She drives her
      point home.

      Title card: What I mean is it's either him AND me! Or neither
      of us!

      Zimmer still isn't sure he's understood. He just looks at
      her.

      Title card: I'm blackmailing you, get it?!
                                                                36.


      Even when she's blackmailing, she's still pretty, and Zimmer
      looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time it's
      obvious that he's going to back down. The people around them
      are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting
      for his decision. There's an element of déjà-vu to the
      situation, and Zimmer, who already backed down a few years
      before, gives in.

      Title card: And why not...

      She smiles at him, picks up the screenplay with delight, and
      leaves. As he moves away she whistles at him. He turns round
      and she vigorously blows him a kiss.


108   INT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                             108

      The screenplay lies on the front seat of a car. The camera
      pulls back, it's Clifton who is in the driving seat.


109   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                  109

      George is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in. At
      first, he's delighted to see him, but this turns into
      astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question. The
      chauffeur answers:

      Title card: I work for Miss Miller now.

      George visibly doesn't know what to think and, although he
      remains pleasant, becomes somewhat reserved. It's as though
      something has come between them. The chauffeur places the
      screenplay on the bedside table. George seems to greet it
      with mistrust, certainly not with enthusiasm.

      The chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts
      on a plate for George. George doesn't want any, it's all too
      much...

      Before he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual
      reserve for the first time and says to George:

      Title card: She's been good to you. She's always looked out
      for you.

      The chauffeur leaves without trying to convince George
      further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt.
                                                               37.


110   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  110

      From the window, we see the chauffeur get into the car and
      drive off. We recognize the car as being the one that belonged
      to George.

      (109) At the window, George watches him leave. Then he seems
      to have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition.


111   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      111

      George goes into the room that's full of sheets. He goes
      straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up
      the sheet. Underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the
      three monkeys "hear no evil", "speak no evil" and "see no
      evil". He thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to
      reveal a piece of furniture. Once again it's a piece that used
      to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the
      auction room.

      After taking off several other sheets, George realizes that
      she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture,
      paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. He rips off sheets
      one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his
      suits and tuxedos. He continues and discovers the painting
      depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. George looks
      stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. He's
      interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room
      once more. This time, at the door, are the butler and the maid.

      George walks towards them when he sees them. The closer he gets
      to them, however, the more his expression tightens. We realize
      that the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking
      man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid
      is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale
      prices. George is looking at them as he leaves the room. He has
      recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. He walks
      off, still shocked by what he's just realized.


112   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY               112

      He finishes putting on his burnt suit in his room, and leaves.


113   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  113

      He goes down the stairs and flees the house.
                                                               38.


114   EXT. BEGGAR STREET - DAY                                  114

      George is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged
      shoes. He is shirtless. With Jack by his side, he walks along
      the sidewalk. There are a few other people walking along. About
      twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. He holds out his
      hand to passers-by. George approaches and, when there are no
      other passers-by between him and George, the beggar glances at
      him and lowers his hand. He doesn't raise it as George
      approaches. George stops in front of him and looks at him, but
      the beggar motions to him to scram. George continues on his
      way. For that moment at least, he has become one of them.

      He buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the
      fact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses
      himself in the crowd. Some distance later, he stops to check
      his reflection in a shop window. The image he sees is that of a
      bum. It's even more striking because the in the window there is
      a young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf.
      The image of the mannequin and that of George are superimposed.

      A cop comes up to George and begins talking to him in a
      friendly manner. He speaks but we don't know what about. There
      is not Title card. George visibly has no idea what the cop is
      talking about. The cop seems to be talking about nothing
      important, just chatting... He talks and talks... George
      doesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand
      why he's talking to him. He's lost.

      Title card: What did you say?

      The cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. He thinks
      he's talking to a madman. He doesn't persist, merely sizes
      George up and, once he's decided that he's harmless, the cop
      walks off. George, totally bewildered by the incident, seems
      to lose his grip on himself a little more.


115   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  115

      Peppy gets home in the evening, arms laden with flowers. She's
      happy.

      She quickly goes up the stairs and into George's bedroom. He's
      not there. She looks for him but can't find him. The maid says
      that he has left. She drops the flowers.


116   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           116

      George goes into his house that has been disfigured by the
      fire. The flames have changed everything and the atmosphere,
      here again, seems ghostly and sad.
                                                               39.


      George sits down in an armchair in the darkness. Jack sits down
      facing him. He wags his tail and it thumps on the ground.


117   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      117

      In the room with all the sheets, Peppy is with the maid. The
      maid seems to be telling her what happened with George, how he
      removed all the sheets, etc. Peppy listens with an inscrutable
      expression on her face. Then, suddenly overcome by a terrible
      thought, she rushes outside.


118   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  118

      She runs out of the house and over to the car, but the
      chauffeur isn't there. She honks the horn to call him but
      there's no response. She honks the horn again, then, not
      wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the
      dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and
      pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. It's obvious that she
      doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full
      speed - more or less successfully. Just as she passes through
      the gate, the chauffeur turns up. Too late. He sees her drive
      away.


119   EXT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                          119

      Peppy is driving as fast as she can through town, but she's
      pretty reckless and almost causes an accident.


120   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           120

      Outside George's house, the wind is slamming one of the
      shutters with the regularity of a metronome. George takes a
      gulp of liquor, then puts down the glass, opens a cardboard box
      and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of
      him. He picks up the glass for another gulp. Jack doesn't like
      what he sees. He barks.

      (119) As for Peppy, she's speeding along, totally ignoring
      even the most basic of road safety requirements.

      (120) George puts down his glass and picks up the pistol.
      Jack isn't happy at all. He barks and bites George's trouser
      leg, pulling on it.

      (119) Peppy speeding along.

      (120) George puts the pistol into his mouth. Jack is barking
      like mad. George, still in the same position, closes his
      eyes.
                                                                40.


      Title card: "BANG!"

      George is in the same position. He still has the pistol in
      his mouth. Visibly, he's heard a BANG from outside, because
      he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the
      window.


121   EXT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            121

      Outside, we see Peppy's car has rammed into the gate and is
      still shuddering. Peppy didn't brake in time, but she doesn't
      care. She jumps out the car and runs into the house.


122   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            122

      She rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look
      at George. George awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind
      him. She bursts into tears.

      Title card: I feel so awful. I only wanted to help you. To
      take care of you...

      He seems to reply that no, it's not her fault, she's got
      nothing to feel bad about. He opens his arms towards her,
      still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself.
      Fortunately no one is hurt, but the incident makes Peppy
      laugh and, between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws
      herself into George's arms. They hug for a long time. Peppy
      says into his ear,

      Title card: You've got so much that no one else has...

      And into her ear, George replies:

      Title card: No, I'm nothing but a shadow. No good for
      anything but silence.

      Peppy doesn't reply. She just holds him tighter still and
      closes her eyes. Jack is sitting close by, watching them and
      wagging his tail.

      Outside, the shutter is still slamming and the car is still
      shuddering. Peppy opens her eyes. Visibly, she's had an idea.

      Jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground. The shutter
      slams. The car shudders. Peppy smiles at George.

      Title card: I know what you have that no one else does.

      Peppy moves away from George and motions to him to listen.
      The shutter slams. Jacks tail thumps. The car shudders... Peppy
      does a few tap steps. George doesn't understand.
                                                               41.


      Peppy starts again, with a beaming smile, waiting for his
      response. George does a few tap steps himself, basic ones,
      without any great enthusiasm. She smiles at him and does a
      few more complex steps that are a lot livelier. He smiles
      back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his
      feet. He looks at Peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his
      face.


123   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS (1931) - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY     123

      Music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in
      another decor. Except that from now on we actually hear the
      sound of the tap steps. We pull back to find Peppy and George
      in Zimmer's office. They're dancing for him. Little by little,
      Zimmer is convinced by them, and, when they finish their
      demonstration, he has a broad smile on his face.


124   INT. STUDIO - PEPPY & GEORGE - DAY                        124

      We find Peppy and George on a film set, still dancing. The
      piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now
      everyone wants to get up and dance! They are dancing a tap
      number facing the camera, in a décor representing a stylized
      New York. The choreography is incredible, in the grand style
      of the old Hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee
      slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on
      their faces. The music stops on a powerful blast from the
      brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy.
      In the ensuing silence, Peppy and George stay exactly where
      they were, facing the camera, with the smile stuck on their
      faces. It goes on for a little too long, they are out of
      breath.

      Then they look at someone off-shot. They are facing a film
      crew (from their era of course). The director smiles. Zimmer,
      sitting next to him, seems ecstatic. The director speaks and
      we hear what he says.

                          DIRECTOR
                Cut! Excellent!

      Zimmer has both his thumbs up. The director says to Peppy and
      George.

                          DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                Once more? Please?

      George laughs and replies, and we hear him too.

                          GEORGE
                With pleasure!
                                                       42.


                           THE End

The credits run while Peppy and George go back to their
positions. The camera (ours) pulls back and into frame come
all the technicians who are setting up the shot, the hair,
make-up and costume people for continuity, the camera coming
into position, the director coming over to say a few words to
the star couple, in short: the shot being prepared for
another take. And, when everyone is in position, the director
speaks into his megaphone and we hear "OK, Camera! Sound!
Rolling... and... Action!"

Fade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the
credit sequence.

	Story by 

	Mark Andrus





	FADE IN:

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an 
	enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up 
	against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the 
	unseen love of her long life.

			SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I'm just going to get some 
		flowers, dear. I'll be back in 
		twenty minutes. It's tulip season 
		today. I'm so happy.

	And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness 
	dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that 
	quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her 
	apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

	POV - MELVIN UDALL

	in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, 
	unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever 
	met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength 
	is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the 
	elevator door he holds open.

			MELVIN
		Come here, sweetheart... come on.

	ON DOG

	Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. 
	Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the 
	mutt who has ignores him.

			MELVIN
		Wanna go for a ride? Okay, 
		sweetie?

	The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges 
	and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog 
	urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG 
	sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

			MELVIN
			(a malevolent tone)
		You've pissed your last floor, you 
		dog-eared monkey.

	The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much 
	meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout 
	shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the 
	garbage chute.
				
			MELVIN
		I'll bet you wish you were some 
		sort of real dog now, huh? Don't 
		worry...  this is New York. If you 
		can make it here, you can make it 
		anywhere, you know? You ugly, 
		smelly fuck.

	And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and 
	lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS" 
	from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment 
	door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON 
	NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with 
	Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of 
	trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about 
	to enter his apartment.

			SIMON
		Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie... 

	He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.
			
			SIMON
		Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey 
		there!
			(as Melvin turns)
		Have you seen Verdell?

			MELVIN
		What's he look like?

	Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is 
	directly opposite Simon's.

			SIMON
		My dog... you know... I mean my 
		little dog with the adorable 
		face... Don't you know what my dog 
		looks like?

			MELVIN
		I got it. You're talking about 
		your dog. I thought that was the 
		name of the colored man I've been 
		seeing in the hall.

	Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

			SIMON
		Which color was that?

			MELVIN
		Like thick molasses, with one of 
		those wide noses perfect for 
		smelling trouble and prison 
		food... 

	Simon has had it.

			SIMON
		Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

			MELVIN
			(not missing a beat)
		How're you doing?

				SIMON
		Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I 
		think you know that.

				FRANK
			(overlapping)
		Simon, you've got to get dressed.

				MELVIN
			(to Simon)
		What I know is that as long as you 
		keep your work zipped up around 
		me, I don't give a fuck what or 
		where you shove your show. Are we 
		being neighbors for now?

				SIMON
			(to Frank)
		Do you still think I was 
		exaggerating?

	FRANK can only smile.

				FRANK
		Definitely a package you don't 
		want to open or touch.

				MELVIN
		Hope you find him. I love that 
		dog.

	Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds 
	himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

				SIMON
			(directly)
		You don't love anything, Mr. 
		Udall.

	Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the 
	hallway.

				MELVIN
		I love throwing your dog down the 
		garbage chute.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to 
	five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and 
	off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards 
	his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens 
	the medicine chest.

	INT. MEDICINE CHEST

	Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps 
	one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the 
	process two more times.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

	A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN 
	holding Verdell who looks and finds:

	SIMON

	who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves 
	quickly toward the group and his dog.

				SIMON
		Thank the good Lord... wow... my 
		honey... where have you been?

				PARTY GOER
			(thinking the greeting's 
			for him)
		He always liked me.

	As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the 
	Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a 
	laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As 
	the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. 
	Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks 
	some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts 
	Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS 
	in protest.

				SIMON
		Just for a second, okay?

	The DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

				SIMON
			(kissing him on the mouth)
		Look at him...  where was little 
		baby?

				HANDYMAN
			(smiling)
		In the basement garbage bin eating 
		diaper shit.

	Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in 
	cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.

				SIMON
		Go ahead, John, you earned your fun.
			(looking at Verdell)
		How did he get down in the 
		basement? I mean even if he got 
		on the elevator how... ?

				HANDYMAN
		Maybe some nice neighbor shoved 
		him down the garbage chute.

				SIMON
		My God! No!

	He stares out... Frank frustrated following.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT

	Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he 
	writes.

				MELVIN
		'Somewhat in the dark, she had 
		confessed and he had forgiven. 
		This is what you live for, he 
		said. Two heads on a pillow where 
		there is only the safety of being 
		with each other. How, she 
		wondered, could she find such hope 
		in the most shameful part of her.'

	He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall.

	But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

				MELVIN
		'At last she was able to define 
		love. Love was... '

	More KNOCKING.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you 
		please.

				MELVIN
		'Love was... '

	He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of 
	love -- but the knocking throws him.

				MELVIN
		... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
		stool-pusher.

	He burst from his chair.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step 
	back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

				MELVIN
			(loud and angry)
		Yeeeess!!!

				SIMON
		Maybe this can wait.

	Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

				SIMON
		I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

				MELVIN
		Well, that's a load off.

	Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to 
	close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

				SIMON
		Did you... do something to him?

				MELVIN
		Do you realize that I work at 
		him?

				SIMON
			(eyes downcast)
		No, I didn't.

				MELVIN
		Do you like to be interrupt when 
		you are danging around in your 
		little garden?

				SIMON
		No...  actually, I even shut the 
		phone off and put a little piece 
		of cardboard in the ringer so no 
		one can just buzz me from d... 

				MELVIN
		Well, I work all the time. So 
		never, never again interrupt me. 
		Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 
		years from now... not if there's 
		fire. Not even if you hear a thud 
		from inside my home and a week 
		later there's a smell from in 
		there that can only come from a 
		decaying body and you have to hold 
		a hanky against your face because 
		the stench is so thick you think 
		you're going to faint even then 
		don't come knocking or, if it's 
		election night and you're excited 
		and want to celebrate because some 
		fudge-packer you dated has been 
		elected the first queer President 
		of the United States... and he's 
		going to put you up in Camp David 
		and you just want to share the 
		moment with someone...  don't knock
		...  not on this door. Not for 
		anything. Got me. Sweetheart?

				SIMON
		Yes. It's not a subtle point 
		you're making.

				MELVIN
		Okay, then.

	Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

				SIMON
		So the theory of confrontations is 
		that now he'll think twice before 
		messing with me?

	Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

				SIMON
		He's genuinely upsetting, isn't 
		he?

				FRANK
		Won't worry about it. You go 
		ahead.

	Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly 
	on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really 
		pissed!!!

	Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. 
	Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him 
	forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

				MELVIN
		No touch. No touch. No touch.

				FRANK
		You may think you can intimidate 
		the whole world with your 
		attitude, but I grew up in Hell. 
		My grandmother had more attitude. 
		You don't intimidate me.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Police! Police! Fucking crooked 
		police...  doughnut-munching morons 
		help me!
			(to Frank)
		Assault and battery and you're 
		black.

				FRANK
		Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like 
		him enough to batter you 
		unrecognizable if you verbally 
		abuse him or so much as touch his 
		dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try 
		and think how you can make this up 
		to him.
			(suddenly loud)
		I hate doing this. I'm an art 
		dealer.
			(beat)
		Have a nice day. Party!

	He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens 
	his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as 
	he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears 
	impressed.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His 
	walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the 
	danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. 
	At times he places his palms together and extends his 
	arms cutting a path through people. We will be very 
	pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	His eyes focused on the terrain.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	ANGLE ON WAITRESS

	CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. 
	You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be 
	the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a 
	story about her son for the umpteenth time.

				CAROL
			(to the Mother's 
			little girl)
		Look at you, you're all better.

				MOTHER
		It's that new medication.

				CAROL
		You know all my son's stuff, 
		right?

	The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but 
	Carol interrupts her.

				CAROL
		No, no, no, I got a date tonight. 
		I'm walking out the door this 
		morning and he says to me, 'Mom, 
		I promise not to get one of my 
		fevers or coughs during your 
		date.'

				MOTHER
		Isn't that sweet.

				CAROL
		Little blonde angle.
			(to child, 
			affectionately)
		Eat everything.

	Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a 
	table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find 
	a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.

				WOMAN
		It just came out of me. I said 
		you love me the way a remote 
		control loves a TV. As long as I 
		switch every time... 

				HER MALE COMPANION
		Wonderful.

				MELVIN
		People who talk in metaphors can 
		shampoo my crotch.
			(on their look)
		Eat up.

	They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the 
	waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, 
	are talking.

				LISA
		Pay me back next week.

				CAROL
		I owe you. I told you today... 
		them's the rules. Oh, excuse me, 
		Melvin.

	She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out 
	of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else 
	ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

				MELVIN
		I'm starving.

				CAROL
			(firmly to Lisa)
		Will you please take it?

	Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with 
	stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out 
	of the way... 

				LISA
		This way you take a cab home so 
		you have time to get ready for the 
		date.

				CAROL
		"Ready" is not my problem.

	She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could 
	read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the 
	date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

				CAROL
			(to Melvin)
		Go sit down. You know you're not 
		allowed back here...  Spencer's 
		more excited about it than I am... 
		He says, "Mom, I promise not to 
		get a fever or couch during your date."

	The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go 
	"awww."

				CAROL
		I know. He's just the best.

				MELVIN
		I've got Jews at my table.

				CAROL
		It's not your table. It's the 
		place's table. Behave. This 
		once, you can sit at someone 
		else's station.

	The two waitresses signal their protests.

				CAROL
		Or you can just wait your turn... 

	Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs 
	near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo... 
	then:

				MELVIN
		How much more you got to eat? 
		Your appetite isn't as big as 
		your noses, is it?

				WOMAN
		What?!!

				MAN
			(to Woman)
		Let's go --

	The Woman starts to protest.

				MAN
		Let's leave. We're going.

	Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his 
	pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. 
	As he opens his utensils.

				CAROL
		Bryan says he doesn't care how 
		long you've been coming you ever 
		act like this again you're barred 
		for life. I'm gonna miss the 
		excitement, but I'll handle it.

	There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some 
	ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only 
	one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear 
	the table.

				MELVIN
		The table's fine if it had some 
		cholesterol on it. Two sausages, 
		six bacon strips, fries, three 
		eggs over easy and coffee.

				CAROL
		You're gonna die soon with that 
		diet, you know that?

				MELVIN
		We're all gonna die soon. I will. 
		You will. It sure sounds like 
		your son will.

	ON CAROL

	Stunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her 
	perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin 
	senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.

				CAROL
		If you ever mention my son again, 
		you will never be able to eat here 
		again. Do you understand? Give me 
		some sign you understand or leave 
		now. Do you understand me... 
			(adds truthful label)
		you crazy freak? Do you?!?

	A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing 
	down.

				CAROL
		Okay. I'll get your order.

	She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower 
	lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room 
	sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make 
	noises as she responds...  each time startling herself 
	with her own noise and trying to reign it in.

	She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway 
	-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the 
	emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young 
	Man stops and looks at her.

				YOUNG MAN
		What?

				CAROL
		I...  I...  I don't know...  You got 
		me.

	His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited 
	but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the 
	fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her 
	mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt 
	opening her mouth. She stops him.

				CAROL
		Let me just do whatever I do by 
		myself...  I'll catch up to you 
		someplace I promise.
			(as he's put off)
		Oh, no...  don't look like that. 
		No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

	And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed 
	the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about 
	egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when 
	we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and 
	COUGHING.

				CAROL
		Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.

	Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

				SPENCER (O.S.)
			(softly)
		Grandma, grandma... 

				YOUNG MAN
		Maybe you better check.

				CAROL
		Like what did you think I was 
		going to do?

	INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... 
	she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her 
	mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... 
	she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the 
	cough.

				BEVERLY
		I'm sorry. I was hearing just 
		everything you were doing so I put 
		these on to give you privacy.

	Carol now goes into her son's room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... 
	two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer 
	(breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand 
	filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with 
	some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged 
	into the tiny space.

				SPENCER
		I'm sorry.

				CAROL
		Don't be silly. How bad?

				SPENCER
		Not bad.

	Carol feels his head...  that's okay. Then he coughs -- 
	trying to suppress it...  then a bigger cough...  they each 
	know what that signals...  She brings up a waste basket as 
	he throws up...  she comforts him. He apologizes. She 
	loves him.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

				CAROL
			(a bit panicked)
		You can't smoke...  He can't take 
		smoke.

	He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand 
	squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his 
	hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he 
	picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking 
	at her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to 
	cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.

				CAROL
		Oh, God...  I don't even notice 
		anymore.

	She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make 
	light.

				CAROL
		That'll teach you.

				YOUNG MAN
		Don't apologize.

				CAROL
			(perturbed)
		That wasn't an apology.

	She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her -- 
	how uncomfortable he is.

				CAROL
		Hey...  this is just a little throw-
		up -- it's nothing to be so 
		embarrassed about. Really.
			(as he shifts 
			uncomfortably)
		Thanks for the dinner. Let me 
		write down which trains you take 
		to get back.

				YOUNG MAN
		No way.

	She brightens.

				YOUNG MAN
		I'll take a cab.

	She deflates as he moves past her.

				YOUNG MAN
		Too much reality for a Friday 
		night.

	EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT

	A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the 
	approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN 
	and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and 
	the most likeable of the gritty little trio.

				EVAN
		Why is every customer surprised I 
		read books?

				DOUG
			(amazed)
		You read books?

				EVAN
		Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! 
		He even bought me dinner.

	They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in 
	front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through 
	the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

				CARL
			(slightly exasperated)
		Look, I just can't. I promised 
		Simon I'd find him a model.

				FRIEND (V.O.)
			(on speaker phone,
			flirting)
		Carl, take me off the speaker. 
		Did I tell you that these are 
		house seats? C'mon, you could use 
		a break. Hello...  Carl, are you 
		there...  hello?

	Seeing the hustlers:

				CARL
.		...  I just found a model.

				DOUG
			(to Carl)
		Hey, how it's goin'... 

				EVAN
		Hey, hi...  remember?

				CARL
		I only need one.

				EVAN
		You picked me up, maybe a few 
		weeks, I don't know, some time 
		ago. You were very flattering 
		about our...  encounter.

				CARL
		Maybe just you and me...  but this 
		is for a painting. I need a 
		pretty face.

	Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal 
	his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. 
	He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace 
	humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who 
	scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Sorry, I was out in the studio 
		doing some work and I forgot about 
		our appointment.

	He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away 
	-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him 
	and eyeing the expensive apartment.

				SIMON
		I usually make such a big deal out 
		of picking models but Carl's so 
		thorough. I'll bet he drove you 
		nuts checking your references.

	And he turns and sees the naked model.

				SIMON
			(taken aback)
		This isn't a nude.

	Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.

				VINCENT
		Just kidding around.
			(then mutters)
		So much for love.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)

	Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the 
	increasingly uneasy Simon.

				SIMON
		Exactly what is your previous 
		experience?

				VINCENT
		How about that pose?
			(sing-song)
		This is not fun... 
			(then)
		Give me some direction.

	Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He 
	tries not to show it.

				SIMON
		Nothing. I just watch till 
		something strikes me. Do anything 
		you think of -- try different 
		thing. Until I say, "hold that 
		pose." Then just try and 
		comfortably hold it.

				VINCENT
			(trying another space)
		The fact that you haven't said, 
		"hold it" means I haven't done it 
		right...  is that correct? I 
		haven't done it right?

				SIMON
		No...  Okay. What I do is watch 
		and wait for, um... You ever watch 
		someone who doesn't know you're 
		watching...  an old woman on a bus, 
		kids going to school and you see 
		this flash come over them and you 
		know immediately that it has 
		nothing to do with anything 
		external -- that it's in respond 
		to a private thought they just 
		had? They are just sort of realer 
		and more alive. And when you 
		notice it so are you. If you look 
		at someone long enough, you 
		discover their humanity.

	Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an 
	intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.

				VINCENT
		I know exactly what you mean.

	There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.

				SIMON
		Hold it.

	Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to 
	celebrate.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their 
	order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story 
	of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. 
	Carol is rapt.

	As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give 
	him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so 
	-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment 
	commentary on her every action.

				MELVIN
		Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- 
		she has to pretend she doesn't 
		hear me. Listening to the story 
		from the upset friend...  now she 
		drops off the cappuccino and 
		smiles at the putzette who doesn't 
		even say, "Thank you." No, the 
		putzette wanted the whipped cream 
		so back she goes and now she has 
		to pass him again and it's getting 
		tougher to make believe.

				CAROL
			(reluctant forgiveness)
		Okay.

	Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an 
	uncharacteristic rabbit punch.

				CAROL
		What's with the plastic picnic 
		ware? Why not try ours...  afraid 
		it isn't clean?

				MELVIN
		I see the help -- judgement call.

				CAROL
		Just give yourself a little pep 
		talk. "Must try other people's 
		clean silverware as part of the 
		fun of dining out."

				MELVIN
		What's wrong with your son, 
		anyway?

				CAROL
		What do you care?

	Melvin just looks at her.

				CAROL
		He's gotta fight to breathe. 
		His asthma can just shoot off the 
		charts -- he's allergic to dust 
		and this is New York and his 
		immune system bails on him when 
		there's trouble so an ear 
		infection...  Is this bothering 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(caught)
		No.

				CAROL
		An ear infection can send us to 
		the emergency room -- maybe five, 
		six times a month where I get 
		whatever nine-year-old they just 
		made a doctor. Nice chatting with 
		you.

				MELVIN
		His name?

				CAROL
		Spencer.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

				CAROL
			(quietly)
		Spence.

	She exits.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)

	The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts 
	the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat 
	and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and 
	the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.

				SIMON
		You can put on anything you want 
		now. I might be sort of done 
		here... 

	Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his 
	immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every 
	second of silence during the transition... then LOUD 
	MUSIC PLAYS...  Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon 
	does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down -- 
	which Vincent does.

	ANGLE - APARTMENT

	where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- 
	Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all 
	objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses 
	to look past the terrace to the studio.

				DOUG
		Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY

	MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.

				VINCENT
		So you're practically finished, 
		huh?

				SIMON
		Yes...  well, there's one more 
		stage -- trying to figure out if 
		it's any good.

	Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another 
	perspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod 
	of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate 
	to distract.

	CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his 
	ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to 
	frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

	As Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the 
	canvas.

				VINCENT
		Wait -- I want to see the 
		painting.

				SIMON
		Just a second -- he has to go.

				VINCENT
		Please!! NO!!!

	Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a 
	bullet. Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown 
	to see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized." 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL 
	stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.

	Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he 
	continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing 
	them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.

				SIMON
			(to Vincent)
		What's the matter, sweetheart?

	He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the 
	stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in. 
	Doug greets him.

				DOUG
		Yo.

	Simon turns to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Why are you doing this?

				VINCENT
		No. No. No. Hey, that painting 
		in there...  I just want to tell 
		you... 

	Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.

				EVAN
			(to Vincent)
		What are you doing? Cruising him?

	And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a 
	club, as the brief savage attack begins.

	ON VERDELL

	as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in 
	fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single 
	BARK from VERDELL.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK

	A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is 
	whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if 
	Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the 
	wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.

				RAY
		Okay. So you call 911 and don't 
		leave your name -- even a dumb 
		geezer should know that emergency 
		automatically pulls up your name. 
		How come you make a mistake like 
		that?

				MELVIN
		How come you're pretending to do 
		cop work -- 'cause I don't think 
		you could find your ass if you 
		were spotted the hole.

				RAY
			(stunned)
		What?

				MELVIN
		Just move on. No one here killed 
		him.

				RAY
		Oh, is he dead?

				MELVIN
		Ask him.

				RAY
		We will if we can and if we can't, 
		we'll come back and ask you again 
		and again.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - 
	ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

	Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a 
	leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic 
	little CRYING SOUNDS.

	As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...  Frank is talking to the 
	Sweet-Faced Woman.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I've been praying for him since I 
		heard.

				FRANK
		So I've got to get to the 
		hospital. If you could take the 
		dog just for tonight.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, Lord -- I've got all these 
		antique knick-knacks...  Or else 
		I'd be glad... 

				FRANK
		Maybe if you kept locked in 
		the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.
			(as he turns away and she 
			closes the door he adds)
		Old bitch...  Damn dog.

	A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed 
	and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings... 

	VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches 
	his mugger:

				FRANK
		You're taking him...  yes...  you're 
		taking him -- this will clear the 
		books. One night. You want to 
		say "no" to me? Try...  because 
		I've never felt as nuts as I do 
		right this second. I almost want 
		you to try saying "no."

				MELVIN
			(quietly)
		I'm not saying nothing to you.

				FRANK
		Thanks for looking after him.

	Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and 
	places Verdell inside.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to 
	block Verdell's escape.

	The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped 
	in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We 
	STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head 
	turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue 
	continues O.S.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Hey, where are you going? You 
		can't do this.
			(calls after Frank)
		I can't take a dog.
			(a confession)
		Nobody's ever been in here before.

				FRANK (O.S.)
			(threatening)
		You don't want to mess with me 
		today. I'll figure something else 
		out tomorrow.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now 
	Melvin sees him.

				MELVIN
		You're dead!!

	VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking 
	along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a 
	bit calming.

				MELVIN
		I don't have dog food. And I 
		won't want dog food here. You'll 
		eat what we have. You'll eat what 
		we eat.

	Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped 
	meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the 
	room.

				MELVIN
		Don't you touch anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC 
	CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and 
	exits...  Verdell breathes excitedly though looking 
	alternately in all directions... his recent past making 
	him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs 
	cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a 
	dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound 
	of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then 
	MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he 
	sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd. 
	Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl 
	with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and 
	sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of 
	Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks 
	over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts 
	and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out 
	the lights and exits.

	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

	Frank on the phone.

				FRANK
			(into phone)
		Put the solid red dots on three of 
		them and the hold blue dots on two 
		others...  Well, we're not going to 
		sell anything if they know we're 
		two weeks into a show and have no 
		sales. No, you can't reduce a 
		price at this stage...  We're in 
		free fall here. Any calls?

				JACKIE
		We can see him.

				FRANK
		I'll meet you in there.

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	As Jackie enters.

				JACKIE
		How you doing, great one?

				SIMON
		I haven't looked at myself yet. I 
		figured I could tell from your 
		reaction.

	He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his 
	painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a 
	horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into 
	yuccchhh...  The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into 
	tears...  sobs, actually.

				SIMON
		That bad, huh?

	They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in 
	the doorway.

				FRANK
		Hey, hey... 
			(as he sees him)
		Haaa...  bad but temporary. The 
		nurses say it's much better than 
		you looked three weeks ago...  the 
		hand will come back...  they're 
		sure... 

				SIMON
		Jackie, will you hand me the 
		mirror?

				JACKIE
			(a small voice)
		No.

	She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- 
	then thinks better of it.

				JACKIE
		Wait, I have a smaller one.

	But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror -- 
	he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.

				SIMON
		So, what's new anyway? How's 
		Verdell?

				FRANK
			(sheepish)
		Your neighbor -- Udall -- is 
		taking care of him.

				SIMON
			(suddenly alive and upset)
		How could you do that? He'll hurt 
		him.

				FRANK
		No, I promise...  not a chance. I 
		own this guy. There was no one 
		else. I'm on the move too much. 
		Trust me.

				SIMON
		You are very certain my dog is 
		okay...  because you have no 
		idea... 

				FRANK
		Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

	Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, 
	then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive 
	underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.

				SIMON
		Okay, waiting gives the devil 
		time. Now!

	He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror...  
	he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him 
	awed by his misfortune.

				SIMON
		Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?

	EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with 
	his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as 
	she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning 
	periodically to keep an eye of his dog.

				CAROL
		So what are you doing with a dog?

				MELVIN
		Suckered in. Set up. Pushed 
		around.

				CAROL
		You're not worried that someone 
		might take him?

				MELVIN
		Well, not until now -- for 
		Christ's sake.

				CAROL
		Sorry.

				MELVIN
		It's okay -- I'll sit here.

	He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can 
	keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.

				CAROL
		You know he's a little dog. Next 
		time, if Bryan's not here, you can 
		bring him in.

				MELVIN
		How old are you?

				CAROL
		Oh, please... 

				MELVIN
		If I had to guess by your eyes, 
		I'd say you were fifty.

	Carol looks at him.

				CAROL
		And if I had to guess by your 
		eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, 
		so much for eyes. But as long as 
		you bring up age...  how old are 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(quickly)
		Otherwise, you're not ugly.

				CAROL
			(laughs out loud)
		Okay, pal...  I accept the 
		compliment, but go easy -- my 
		knees start a-knocking when you 
		turn on the charm full blast.

				MELVIN
		What's with the dark?

	He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.

				CAROL
		Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. 
		My son had a full blown attack. 
		And this time, for extra fun, they 
		gave us the wrong antibiotics, so 
		I get him home... 

	She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes 
	nuts.

				MELVIN
		No...  no...  leave it...  the 
		bacon's for the dog.

	She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, 
	but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.

				MELVIN
		Last week I was playing the piano 
		for him and he likes it, and so I 
		decide I'm going to make a little 
		joke... 

				CAROL
		You all set here?

	Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to 
	finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a 
	beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is 
	avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.

				MELVIN
		It's a beautiful day for our walk.

	Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.

	ON VERDELL

	again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the 
	sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic 
	gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.

				MELVIN
		Don't be like me, don't you be 
		like me. You stay just the way 
		you are because you are a perfect 
		man. I'm gonna take you home and 
		get you something to eat...  what 
		you love.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				FEMALE PASSERSBY
			(charmed)
		Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like 
		that.

				MELVIN
			(all smiles to Verdell)
		Let's go home and do some writing.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself 
	with great satisfaction as he goes.

	Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his 
	master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing 
	aloud to the dog.

				MELVIN
		"He turned off the gas jets and 
		carried her outside. He kissed 
		her brow and when her eyes opened 
		and found him, he said, 'there are 
		easier ways to break a date.' She 
		laughed. The only sensible 
		ambition he had ever known was now 
		realized. He had made the girl 
		happy. And what a girl. 'You've 
		saved my life,' she said, 'you'd 
		better make it up to me.'"

	Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine... 

				MELVIN
			(singing to Verdell)
		Done!
			(playing with him some)
		Yes, I hate the doggy...  yes, I 
		hate the doggy.

	He exits.

				MELVIN (V.O.)
		Sixty-two books... done!

	As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our 
	couple's play time for... 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

	As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul 
	mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the 
	maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few 
	words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and 
	talk of how long Nora can stay on.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.

				FRANK
		How's Verdell doing?

				MELVIN
		He's a pain in the ass.

	As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, 
	without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's 
	surprise.

				FRANK
		Simon's home. I was sort of 
		hoping you could keep the dog 
		until he's had a chance to think 
		and adjust... 

				MELVIN
			(leaping at the chance)
		It's been five weeks...  another 
		few won't kill me.

				FRANK
		No. He wants him back. He'll be 
		by tomorrow.

				MELVIN
			(too loudly, weirdly)
		Okay by me.

	Frank exits.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to 
	the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are 
	locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in the 
	correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back to 
	check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished, 
	until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.

	INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

	Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a 
	wheelchair and shudders... 

				MELVIN
		That's some face they left hanging 
		on you. You look like... 

				SIMON
			(interrupting)
		Could you take it just a little 
		easy, Mr. Udall?

	A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.

				SIMON
		Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?
			(to Melvin)
		By the way, thanks for saving me.

				MELVIN
		I called. I never touched you. I 
		didn't leave my name or nothing.

				SIMON
			(not listening)
		Verdell?

	ON VERDELL

	Totally weirded out...  hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin 
	shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...  Simon 
	smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the 
	reunion.

				SIMON
		Hi, sweetheart.

	Verdell isn't eager.

	ON SIMON

	The first gnawing pains of rejection.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get 
	Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the 
	door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog 
	up.

				SIMON
		No. Please, don't force him.

				JACKIE
			(to dog)
		You little stinker. He's given 
		you everything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	MELVIN'S POV

	Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and 
	hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...  
	there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly 
	one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels 
	the panic rise in him... 

	...  all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and 
	now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.

				MELVIN
		Over the dog...  an ugly dog.

	It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual 
	sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite 
	pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but 
	highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared, 
	beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.

	EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

	Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then 
	turning into a building with a copper sign reading 
	"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."

				MELVIN
		Worst sidewalk in New York and 
		look where they put in.

	INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

	Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.

				MELVIN
		Help!

				DOCTOR
		If you want to see me you will not 
		do this. You will make an 
		appointment... 

				MELVIN
		Explain to me how you can diagnose 
		someone as "obsessive compulsive 
		disorder" and then act like I have 
		any choice in barging in.

				DOCTOR
		There's not going to be a debate. 
		You must leave.

	The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to 
	follow.

				MELVIN
		You said you could help me -- 
		what was that -- a tease?

				DOCTOR
		I can help you if you take the 
		responsibility to keep regular 
		app --

				MELVIN
			(suddenly)
		You changed the room around... 

				DOCTOR
		Two years ago... 

	Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough 
	he must go through a careful exercise noting every new 
	element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies 
	each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued 
	despite himself.

				DOCTOR
		I also regrew my beard...  but 
		you're not interested in changes 
		in me... so it's like I always 
		told you...  when it comes to 
		people you... 

				MELVIN
		Shhhhhhh. I don't have this 
		mountain of available time...  I 
		got to get to my restaurant on 
		time. Do you know how hard it is 
		for me to be here?

				DOCTOR
		Yes.
			(as Melvin starts 
			for the office)
		No.

	INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY

	More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin 
	passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops. 
	Eyes on them. Then:

				MELVIN
			(to other patients)
		What if this is as good as it 
		gets?

	They look stricken. He exits.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief. 
	CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his 
	table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils 
	and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT 
	AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl 
	looks at his utensils.

				CHERYL
		What the heck are those for?

				MELVIN
		No. No. Get Carol.

				CHERYL
		I'm filling in. We don't know if 
		she's coming back. She might have 
		to get a job closer to home.

				MELVIN
		What are you trying to do to me?

				CHERYL
		What the heck do you mean?

				MELVIN
		Hey, elephant girl, call her or 
		something...  just let her do my 
		one meal here. I'll pay whatever. 
		I'll wait.
			(as she doesn't 
			budge; he screams)
		Do it!!!

	The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police 
	that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.

				MANAGER
		Out. Be silent or leave.

				MELVIN
		I'll be quiet. Just let me wait. 
		No problem. Get her here -- have 
		her get me two sausages, four 
		bacon, two eggs over easy and 
		coffee. I'm not a prick here -- 
		I'm a great customer. This day is 
		a disaster. I can't handle this, 
		too.

				MANAGER
		Get out immediately or there's 
		going to be trouble.

	Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless 
	situation and rises.

				MELVIN
		There's going to be trouble???

	He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other 
	employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near 
	the door he hands him 20 dollars.

				MELVIN
		Carol's last name?

				BUSBOY
		Connelly.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

	An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.

	MELVIN'S POV

	A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever 
	the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of 
	community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving 
	their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local 
	store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.

	EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY

	Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. 
	She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a 
	thermometer.

				MELVIN
		I'm hungry.
			(on Carol's astonished 
			look)
		You've upset my whole day. I 
		haven't eaten.

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge 
	he had imagined she might make... 

				MELVIN
		This is not a sexist thing. If 
		you were a waiter I would still be 
		here saying... 

				CAROL
		Are you totally gone? This is my 
		private home... 

				MELVIN
		I am trying to keep emotions out of 
		this. Even though this is an 
		important issue to me and I have 
		strong feelings about the subject.

				CAROL
		What subject? That I wasn't there 
		to take crap from you and bring 
		you eggs? Do you have any control 
		over how creepy you allow yourself 
		to get?

				MELVIN
		Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... 
		and to prove it I have not gotten 
		personal and you have. Why aren't 
		you at work? You're not sick -- 
		you don't look sick... just very 
		tired and bitter.

				CAROL
		My son is sick, okay?

	Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some 
	emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy 
	man at her threshold.

				MELVIN
		What about your mother?

				CAROL
		How do you know about my mother?

				MELVIN
		I hear you talk when I'm 
		waiting!!!

	She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a 
	step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into 
	the room.

				CAROL
		Sorry, honey...  I'll be right 
		there.

				MELVIN
			(uncomfortably)
		How ya doing?

	Spencer just stares at him.

				MELVIN
			(miffed)
		You should answer when someone 
		talks to you... 

	Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then 
	emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs 
	out the door.

				CAROL
		Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, 
		and I can't handle you teaching 
		my son manners.

	She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son 
	and leads him back to his room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM

	CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of 
	Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his 
	ear. They both count down the seconds.

				CAROL AND SPENCER
		5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo.

				SPENCER
		104.9

				CAROL
		We are going to treat ourselves to 
		a cab ride.

	EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol carries her young son through a class of 
	uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She 
	spots Melvin about to enter a cab.

				CAROL
		Melvin, wait!

	The school kids pick up the chant in unison.

				SCHOOL KIDS
		Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! 
		Melvin, wait!

	He turns to face them.

				MELVIN
		Shut up, kids!

	They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.

				CAROL
		Melvin...  give us a lift. We've 
		got to go see our friends at the 
		hospital.

	Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the 
	rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The 
	maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

				MELVIN
		I'll ride up front. Cover your 
		mouth when you cough, kid.

	INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY

	As they settle in and drive off.

				CAROL
		Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, 
		please and quickly please.

	EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

	As Carol enters the hospital.

				CAROL
			(calling back)
		I owe you three dollars.

	Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son... 

				MELVIN
		Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll 
		get back to work today?

				CAROL
			(furiously)
		No!!! Stay away from me!

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for 
	Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...  
	she has some index cards in her laps which she 
	occasionally consults and shuffles.

				JACKIE
		I feel terrible that I have to... 
		Simon? Forget about the dog for a 
		second.

	Simon forces his attention to Jackie.

				SIMON
		Sorry. What are those cards?

				JACKIE
			(a bit embarrassed)
		Frank's idea. He thought I should 
		have notes so I did this right... 
		maintained focus, didn't get 
		emotional and tried not to terrify 
		you.

				SIMON
			(scared shitless)
		Terrify me?

				JACKIE
		See, he's right. I need the 
		cards.
			(reading from cards)
		Simon, you're broke.

	ANGLE ON VERDELL

	as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.

				JACKIE (O.S.)
		The medical bill are 61 thousand 
		now. I've spoken to your parents 
		and they didn't hang up or 
		anything -- they just said they 
		would feel strange calling you.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Well, I can't reach them.

	Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns 
	for:

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		Here, baby...  what is it, 
		Verdell?...  You miss the tough 
		guy... 
			(trying to be 
			Melvin-like)
		Well, here I am, you little pissant 
		mop, happy to see me? How about 
		another ride down the chute? Oh, 
		God...  I don't mean it, 
		sweetheart... 
			(on Jackie's look)
		I'm sorry. I know... 

	Verdell hides behind a chair.

				JACKIE
		Frank loves you. You know that... 
		but I've spoken to him and he 
		feels that --
			(reading from card)
		-- as a businessman, with limited 
		resources... 

				SIMON
		I'll be able to keep my apartment 
		and studio, won't I?...  Just tell 
		me.

	As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.

				SIMON
			(overwhelmed)
		Wow... 

	Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet 
	the dog and the dog ducks.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset. 
	He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He 
	is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.

	INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

	We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening 
	with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering 
	phone calls, "Premier Publishing."

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
		Yes, you write more than anyone 
		else. Yes, you make us a lot of 
		money, but isn't there someone 
		more appropriate to... 

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I need this. Just say, "Melvin, 
		I'll try," okay?

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
			(resigned)
		Melvin, I'll try.

	They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She 
	pauses at the elevator.

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE
		Now, on a pleasant note, our son 
		got accepted at Brown. My 
		husband... 

				MELVIN
			(curtly)
		Great, wonderful. I don't need 
		you to wait with me.

	She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe 
	summons her moxie.

				ZOE
		I can't resist. You usually move 
		through here so quickly and I have 
		so many questions I want to ask 
		you. You have no idea what your 
		work means to me.

				MELVIN
		What's it mean?

				ZOE
		That somebody out there knows what 
		it's like to be... 
			(taps her head and heart)
		in here.

				MELVIN
		Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

				ZOE
		Aw come on, just a couple of 
		questions -- how hard is that?

	As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button 
	etc.

				ZOE
		How do you write women so well?

				MELVIN
			(as he turns 
			toward her)
		I think of a man and take away 
		reason and accountability.

	The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.

	EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is 
	suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.

	CAROL'S POV

	A car at the curb with "MD" license plate.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As Carol breaks into a run.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY

	As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and 
	jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering 
	sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment.

				CAROL
		Hello? Hello?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.

	The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, 
	her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk 
	on opening day of the hunting season.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY

				CAROL
		What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

				DR. BETTES
		Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes
		...  Dr. Bettes.

				CAROL
		Not your name...  what are you 
		telling me your name for!! Where 
		is he?

				DR. BETTES
		He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.

				CAROL
			(overlapping)
		Tell me how bad it is. I let him 
		go out last night when it was so 
		cool without an overshirt -- just 
		and underone with just the straps 
		and I know better...  and I let him 
		talk me into it. He was whining 
		and...  you don't need this. Give 
		me a second to catch hold.

	And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some 
	notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it 
	takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and 
	she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer 
	enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now. 
	Salvation as farce.

				SPENCER
			(to his mother)
		Hi... 
			(they kiss)
		Did you know there are doctors who 
		come to your house?

				CAROL
		No, I didn't.
			(to Bettes)
		So why are you h... 

	Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient 
	which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

				BEVERLY
		I didn't know you had a secret 
		admire.

				CAROL
		Huh?

				BEVERLY
		You met the gift.

				SPENCER
		He's good...  And I'm an expert on 
		doctors.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		Stay out of this...  Doctor?

				DR. BETTES
		My wife is Melvin Udall's 
		publisher.
			(as Carol reacts)
		She says I have to take great care 
		of this guy because you're 
		urgently needed back at work. 
		What work do you do?

				CAROL
		I'm a waitress.

	ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.

				BEVERLY
		In Manhattan.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Dr. Bettes?

				DR. BETTES
		In here.

	A NURSE enters.

				NURSE
		Sorry it took so long. I don't 
		know Brooklyn.

				DR. BETTES
		It's okay, Terry.
			(hands her blood 
			vail)
		Tell the lab I'd like the report 
		back today.

	Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.

				CAROL
		You're going to get the results 
		today?!

	MOVING SHOT

	As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from 
	each other at a small table... soft voices...  relaxation. 
	Bettes is examining medicine bottles.

				DR. BETTES
		How long has he been having 
		problems?

				CAROL
		Since forever.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done blood tests on him?

				CAROL
		Yes.

				DR. BETTES
		Only in the emergency room or when 
		he was well.

				CAROL
		Emergency room only.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done skin testing for 
		allergies?

				CAROL
		No.

				DR. BETTES
		They haven't done the standard 
		scratch test. Where they make 
		small injections into the skin?

				CAROL
		No. I asked. They said it's not 
		covered under my plan. And it's 
		not necessary anyway.

				DR. BETTES
		It's amazing these things weren't 
		done.

				CAROL
		Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of 
		shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.

				DR. BETTES
		No. Actually, I think that's 
		their technical name.

				CAROL
		Once the tests come back, is there 
		someone I can reach in your office 
		for the results?

				DR. BETTES
		Me. My home number is on this 
		card.

				CAROL
		His home number.

	Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly 
	has a hard time stopping.

				CAROL
			(to doctor)
		Do you want some juice or coffee 
		or two female slaves?

				DR. BETTES
		Water...  Nobody told you it might 
		be a good idea to remove the 
		carpeting and drapes in Spencer's 
		room?

				CAROL
		No.

	She starts towards Spencer's room.

				DR. BETTES
		You don't have to do it this 
		second...  it's not dangerous or 
		anything. It's just something 
		that's advisable. Look, there's 
		a lot to be checked but...  Hey, 
		your son is going to feel a 
		good deal better at the very 
		least... 

	She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce 
	intimacy.

				CAROL
		Doc!!!
			(then)
		So listen, you gotta let me know 
		about the additional costs -- one 
		way or the other we'll... 

				DR. BETTES
		They're considerable. But Mr. 
		Udall wants to be billed.

	She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained 
	Nora hugs him good-bye.

				NORA
		You poor, poor man.

				SIMON
		Let's use just one poor, okay? 
		Anyway, dear, thanks for 
		everything. Forgive my recent 
		crankiness and as soon as things 
		are on track again I'll call.

	She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a 
	sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				NORA
		Who's going to walk Verdell?

	Simon hadn't thought of this either.

				SIMON
		No, no.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY

	Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin 
	opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.

				MELVIN
		Is he dead yet?

				NORA
		No! Would there be any way for 
		you to be willing to walk his dog 
		for him?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely.

				NORA
		Not just today -- Uh, could you 
		do it -- until, until he gets 
		back on his feet?

				MELVIN
		Sure thing.

				NORA
		You're a wonderful man. Two 
		o'clock is a good time. Here's 
		the key in case he's asleep. Open 
		the curtains for him, so he sees 
		God's beautiful work and knows 
		that even things like this happen 
		for the best.

				MELVIN
		Where'd they teach you to talk 
		like this -- some Panama City 
		"Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? 
		Or was today getaway day and your 
		last shot at his whiskey. Sell 
		crazy some place else -- we're all 
		stocked up here.

	He closes the door in her face. She stands there... 
	thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper 
	shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the 
	elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then 
	continues on her way.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT

	The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.

				CAROL
		There is a seriously goofy man 
		behind this. You are not allowed 
		to block out that fact.

				BEVERLY
		Do you really want to go back to 
		the runt doctors in Emergency who 
		keep telling us they can't help?

				CAROL
		It lets a crazy man into our 
		lives.

				BEVERLY
		Come on. Why fight when we know 
		how it will come out. This isn't 
		like stocking or a string of 
		pearls. You don't send this one 
		back.

	EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS. 
	He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that 
	reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult 
	struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he 
	answers.

				SIMON
		Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally, 
		huh? Why, "finally"? Because I 
		called you so many times. Maybe 
		20.
			(relief)
		Oh, boy...  I was hoping it was 
		something like that. You didn't 
		get one of them, huh? 'Cause I 
		mean it wasn't only your office -- 
		it was your home, hotel and the 
		cigar club you like in San 
		Francisco. No -- Sarcastic...  Of 
		course. I believe you. No, don't 
		fire anyone...  Please. Maybe I'm 
		wrong about the 20 times. Take a 
		breath... 
			(more)
		So, you miss me a little? Hey, 
		strike the question -- How's the 
		case going? Really. Fantastic. 
		I didn't hear. I haven't been 
		watching. Great. Just great. 
		I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me? 
		Well, I'm mending. No, I look 
		fine. Well, some of the damage 
		might still be noticeable if you 
		look closely... 

	He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and 
	beaten face... 

				SIMON
		Carl, I need some help and you're 
		the logical one to turn to.
			(aghast)
		No! Not 'cause I blame you for 
		what happened. I hardly get how 
		you can ever think that. No, I'm 
		not being sarcastic.
			(trying to figure it 
			out)
		I guess because you hired the guy 
		who did this you think...  No, I am 
		a sarcastic person. Well, if 
		you must know, the reason I said 
		you were the logical person is 
		because you always told me how you 
		thought I was this great person 
		who made you feel good about 
		humanity and everything. You do 
		remembering saying that? Well, whew. 
		Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but 
		this money thing is ridiculously 
		serious... 

	He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes 
	the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

				SIMON
		"Will you please loan me money? I 
		will pay you back. I will give 
		you whatever percentage of my 
		income I don't absolutely need 
		until I do. It will take a while. 
		But I don't know what I'll do if 
		you say"... that.
			(as he listens)
		I understand...  yes...  No, I do.
			(a bit of boldness)
		But you know, you know -- you 
		didn't even ask how much, Carl? 
		Well, Frank has no right to 
		discuss how much I'm in hock... 
		no, you're right -- not the point. 
		So...  what have you been up to??? 
		Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...  
		how was it? Well, I'm not 
		surprised that there's that much 
		talent around...  great...  Look -- 
		gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel 
		that way at all...  take care, you, 
		too...  you, too...  Good-bye.
			(as he hangs up)
		Pal o' mine.

	It's very quiet.

	LONG SHOT - SIMON

	A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his 
	face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional 
	release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous 
	with the moment of catharsis... 

	...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the 
	CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to 
	focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering 
	the room.

				MELVIN
		Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

				SIMON
		Thank you for walking him.

	Simon wheels away from Melvin.

				SIMON
		If you'll excuse me I'm not 
		feeling so well.

				MELVIN
		It smells like shit in here?

				SIMON
		Go away.

				MELVIN
		That cleaning woman doesn't... 

				SIMON
		Please, just leave.

				MELVIN
		Where are all your queer party 
		friends?

				SIMON
			(his first shout)
		Get out.

	Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon 
	with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?

				SIMON
		Nothing worse than having to feel 
		this way in front of you?

				MELVIN
		Nellie, you're a disgrace to 
		depression.

				SIMON
		Rot in hell, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		No need to stop being a lady... 
		quit worrying -- you'll be back on 
		your knees in no time.

	Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden 
	attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.

				SIMON
		Is this fun for you? Well, you 
		lucky devil...  It just gets better 
		and better. I am losing my 
		apartment and Frank wants me to 
		promise to paint hotter subjects 
		and to beg my parents, who haven't 
		called, for help... and I won't. 
		And I don't want to paint anymore.

	Melvin has made for the door...  Simon blocks him.

				SIMON
		So the life I was trying for is 
		over. The life I had is gone and 
		I am feeling so damn sorry for 
		myself that it is difficult to 
		breathe. Right times for you -- 
		huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is 
		terrified... 
			(a sudden screamed 
			word surprises them 
			both)
		Terrified...  Lucky you, you're 
		here for rock bottom...  me 
		wallowing in self-pity in front of 
		you, you absolute horror of a 
		human being... 

	As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with 
	discomfort.

				MELVIN
		Well, I'll do one thing for you 
		that might cheer you up.

				SIMON
		Get out.

				MELVIN
		Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. 
		You want to know why the dog 
		prefers me...  it's not affection. 
		It's a trick.

	Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's 
	rapt...  Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.

				MELVIN
		I carry bacon in my pocket.

				SIMON
			(pleased)
		Oh, my gosh.

				MELVIN
			(hands him bacon)
		Now we'll both call him.

				SIMON
		Come on, sweetheart... 

				MELVIN
		Yo, yo, yo... 

	Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally 
	surprised and staggered by the implications. True love 
	and such.

				SIMON
		Would you leave now, please?

				MELVIN
		Stupid dog.
			(to Simon)
		I don't get it.

	He exits...  looking apologetically at Simon in stoic 
	ruin.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Carol in bed on the pullout sofa...  She is in turmoil... 
	there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen. 
	She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.

	INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol 
	shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep.

	Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving 
	her nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy 
	here, the woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer 
	dress -- no time for underwear.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

	Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.

	EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM

	Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on 
	her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the 
	subject.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING - 
	NIGHT (RAIN)

	Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the 
	rains come...  We are in a familiar neighborhood.

	ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE

	As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on 
	it.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)

	As she enters building and realizes it's not just that 
	she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet 
	T-shirt contest...  the fabric clinging to her breasts, 
	like the old movie poster of The Deep.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of 
	Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness 
	and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally 
	Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side 
	of the door.

				CAROL
		Uh, Udall?

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Carol the waitress?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her 
	breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it 
	straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is 
	static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it 
	self-conscious pats.

				CAROL
		The doctors had your billing 
		address. I'm sorry about the 
		hour.

				MELVIN
		I was working...  can't you just 
		drop me a thank-you note?

				CAROL
		That's not why I'm here... 
			(tearing suddenly)
		...  though you have no idea what 
		it's like to have a real 
		conversation with a doctor about 
		Spencer... 

				MELVIN
			(very uncomfortable)
		Note. Put it in the note.

				CAROL
		Why did yo do this for me?

				MELVIN
		To get you back at work so you can 
		wait on me.

				CAROL
		But you do have some idea how 
		strange that sounds??? I'm 
		worried that you did this 
		because... 

	She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long 
	silence. Finally.

				MELVIN
		You waiting for me to say 
		something?
			(as she shakes her head)
		What sort of thing do you want? 
		Look, I'll be at the restaurant 
		tomorrow.

				CAROL
		I don't think I can wait until 
		tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

				MELVIN
		What needs clearing up?

				CAROL
			(strong and true)
		I'm not going to sleep with you. 
		I will never, ever sleep with you. 
		Never. Not ever.

	Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the 
	brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to 
	scream --

	-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt 
	during his half turn away from her -- and then answer 
	hoarsely.

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry. We don't open for the 
		no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

	Carol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way 
	ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity.

				CAROL
		I'm not kidding.

				MELVIN
		Okay!!!! Anything else?!?

				CAROL
		Just how grateful I am.

	Her mission completed -- she turns.

				MELVIN
		So you'll be at work?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's 
	night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we've 
	seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor 
	twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his 
	body angles from the bed in a deliberate way.

	He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays 
	very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his 
	forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the light 
	on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator... 

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR - 
	NIGHT

	As he grabs a cardboard take-out box... 

	INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.
	
	He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly.

	SIMON'S APARTMENT

				MELVIN
		I took a chance you were up.

	Simon walks painfully back to a chair.

				MELVIN
		I brought you Chinese soup.

				SIMON
		Thanks.

				MELVIN
		I have never been so tired in my 
		life. Okay, if I sit here?

				SIMON
		Got any easier questions?

	Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.

				MELVIN
		I haven't been sleeping. I 
		haven't been clear or felt like 
		myself. I'm in trouble. Some son 
		of a bitch is burning my bridges 
		behind my back...  But the 
		tiredness -- boy...  Not just 
		sleepy.

				SIMON
		But sick -- nauseous -- where 
		everything looks distorted and 
		everything inside just aches -- 
		when you can barely get up the 
		will to complain.

				MELVIN
			(brightening)
		Yeah... 

	He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to 
	take it from here.

				MELVIN
		I'm glad we did this.

	He rises and makes an awkward exit.

				MELVIN
		Good talking to you.

	He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to 
	express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed 
	pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't 
	even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and 
	is let in by Beverly.

	They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly 
	hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over 
	Carol's shoulder -- "I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and 
	emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my 
	conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how 
	gratefull (sic)... "

				BEVERLY
		You're not still writing that 
		thank-you note?

				CAROL
		I'm on the last page. How do you 
		spell conscience?

				BEVERLY
		C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean 
		from the bakery to baby-sit so 
		let's go out.

				CAROL
		I still don't feel safe leaving 
		Spencer with someone. How do you 
		spell it again?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer is okay. You'd better 
		start finding something else to do 
		with your free time. If you can't 
		feel good about this break and 
		step out a little... 
			(struts and pumps 
			her arms)
		You ought to get Mr. Udall to send 
		you over a psychiatrist.

				CAROL
			(more emotionally 
			than she intended)
		I don't need one 'cause I know 
		what's really going on here. I 
		have to finish this letter or 
		I'll go nuts.
			(looking at paper; 
			weepy)
		This can't be right -- con-
		science.

	Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself 
	on the brink of crying.

				BEVERLY
		Carol. What?

	Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able 
	to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she 
	looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission 
	for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol 
	-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

				CAROL
		I don't know... It's very strange 
		not feeling that stupid panic 
		thing inside you all the time. 
		Without that you just start 
		thinking about yourself -- and 
		what does that ever get anybody. 
		Today, on the bus there was this 
		adorable couple and I felt myself 
		giving them a dirty look -- I had 
		no idea everything was... 

				BEVERLY
		Go ahead.

				CAROL
			(great, forceful 
			hand gestures)
		... moving in the wrong 
		direction... Away from when I 
		even remembered what it was like 
		to have a man to... anything... 
		hold fucking -- sorry -- hands 
		with, for Christ's sake. I was 
		feeling like really bad that Dr. 
		Bettes is married.
			(this next one's 
			tough)
		Which is probably why I make poor 
		Spencer hug me more than he wants 
		to... Like the poor kid doesn't 
		have enough problems. He has to 
		make up for his mom not getting 
		any.
			(weeps at her 
			insight)
		Oh, boy. Who needs these 
		thoughts?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer's doing fine. So what are 
		you saying, that you're frustr... 

				CAROL
		Leave me be! Why are you doing 
		this? Why are you picking at my 
		sores... What is it that you 
		want?... You want what? What's 
		with you? I hope getting me 
		thinking of everything that's 
		wrong when all I want is to not 
		do this has some purpose.
			(puffy; red; 
			furious)
		What is it, Mom? No kidding.

	Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked 
	husky voiced question.

				CAROL
		What is it you want? What?

				BEVERLY
		I want us to go out.

	A beat, then.

				CAROL
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their 
	cry.

				CAROL
			(to Sean)
		We're going out.

				SEAN
			(looking at their 
			red eyes)
		Looks like fun.

	She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what 
	he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting.

				CAROL
		Okay -- we're out of here. I love 
		you.

	Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol 
	as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. 
	Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, 
	going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then 
	to her son to ask:

				CAROL
		Do you love me?

				SPENCER
		Uh-huh.

	Carol exits.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY

	Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A 
	simple and unprecedented experience in their recent 
	lives.

				BEVERLY
		Nice to get out, isn't it?

	Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each 
	other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 
	14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated 
	at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa 
	keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.

				CAROL
		Don't get it wet.

	Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.

				CAROL
		So it's okay?

				LISA
		You almost have me liking him. 
		You sure come from the heart. I 
		never knew what you went through 
		with everything.

				CAROL
		I wanted him to know how much he'd 
		done.
			(looking over)
		Can you believe he's eating with 
		someone.

	ON MELVIN & FRANK

				MELVIN
		It's not my dog and this Simon 
		seems to have enough on his mind 
		-- but he did throw up twice and 
		his spark is off.

				FRANK
		Sure -- take him to the vet.

				MELVIN
		I did. And his stomach is out of 
		whack. So they need him for a 
		couple of days.

				FRANK
		Do it.

				CAROL
		Melvin.

	She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.

				MELVIN
		What's this?

				CAROL
			(sotto)
		A thank-you note for what you did 
		for me.

	He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and 
	walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, 
	confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note.

	After Carol leaves... 

				FRANK
		She's nice.

				MELVIN
			(to Frank)
		Really nice. Shouldn't that be a 
		good thing... telling someone, 
		'no thanks required.'

				FRANK
		It looks like it really went over. 
		You're sure making the rounds. 
		Simon says you brought him soup 
		last night. I hope he doesn't 
		write you a note.

	Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing 
	message.

				FRANK
		What?

				MELVIN
		"What?" Look at you... You sense 
		a mark.

				FRANK
		Hey -- you called me... I... 

				MELVIN
		About a dog.

				FRANK
		Yeah, but it's all about Simon 
		now... you helped with the dog... 
		And now there are other things. 
		I'm just as concerned as you are 
		about Simon.

				MELVIN
		Concerned. I'm just the hall 
		monitor here.

				FRANK
		It's not only financial 
		assistance. What he's got to do 
		is go to Baltimore tomorrow and 
		ask his parents for money. It's 
		not going to happen on the phone.

				MELVIN
		Yeah. If his parents are alive 
		they've got to help -- those are 
		the rules. Good.

				FRANK
		Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high 
		maintenance selling painter coming 
		through... So I'm out. Can you 
		take him?

				MELVIN
		Think white and get serious.

	Carol enters scene.

				FRANK
		Take my car -- a convertible. Do 
		you drive?

				MELVIN
			(loudly)
		Like the wind but I'm not doing 
		it.

				CAROL
		Getting loud, getting loud.

				MELVIN
		He wants me to take his car and 
		his client to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		I want your life for a minute 
		where my big problem is someone 
		offers me a free convertible so I 
		can get out of this city.

	She exits. Frank prepares to depart.

				MELVIN
		Okay. I'll take him. Get him 
		packed -- ready -- tomorrow 
		morning.

	Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.

				MELVIN
			(excited)
		Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. 
		Let's not drag this out. We don't 
		enjoy another that much.

				FRANK
		If there's some mental health 
		foundation that raises money to 
		help people like you be sure to 
		let me know.

				MELVIN
		Last word freak.

	Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a 
	"good-bye" to him.

				CAROL
		So. Anything else?

				MELVIN
		Yes. I'm going to give my queer 
		neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		Okay.

				MELVIN
		Hey, what I did for you is working 
		out?

				CAROL
			(a breath; then)
		What you did changed my life.

	She offers him the note.

				MELVIN
		No... no thank you notes.

				CAROL
		Well, part of what I said in this 
		entire history of my life which 
		you won't read is that somehow 
		you've done more for my mother, my 
		son and me, than anyone else ever 
		has... And that makes you the most 
		important, surprising, generous 
		person I've ever met and that you 
		be in our daily prayers forever.

				MELVIN
		Lovely.

				CAROL
		I also wrote one part... I wrote 
		I'm sorry... I was talking about I 
		was sorry when I got mad at you 
		when you came over and you told my 
		son that he ought to answer back 
		so I wrote that.
			(reading from the 
			letter, Melvin 
			wildly uncomfortable)
		I was sorry for busting you on 
		that... and I'm sorry for busting 
		in on you that night... when I 
		said I was never... I was sorry 
		and I'm sorry every time your food 
		was cold and that you had to wait 
		two seconds for a coffee filler... 

	Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- 
	emotionally moved by her own words.

				CAROL
		... and I'm sorry for never 
		spotting, right there at the table 
		in the restaurant, the human being 
		that had it in him to do this 
		thing for us... You know what, I'm 
		just going to start from the 
		beginning... I have not been able 
		to express my gratefulness to 
		you... even as I look at the word 
		"grateful" now it doesn't begin to 
		tell you what I feel for you... 

	And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.

				MELVIN
		Nice of you... thank you.

				CAROL
		Thank you.

				MELVIN
		Now I want you to do something for me.

	She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.

				CAROL
		Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, 
		"what?" I thought I said, 
		"what?"... What?

				MELVIN
		I want you to go on this trip.

				CAROL
		No, sir... 

				MELVIN
		I can't do this alone. I'm afraid 
		he'll pull the stiff one eye on 
		me. I need you to chaperon. 
		Separate everything but cars. You 
		said you liked convertibles. Now 
		I'm on the hook.

				CAROL
		The stiff one eye?

				MELVIN
		Two days.

				CAROL
		I can't. I work.

				MELVIN
		You take off when you have to.

				CAROL
		My son.

				MELVIN
		Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

				CAROL
			(no other way)
		Melvin, I'd rather not.

				MELVIN
		What's that got to do with it?

				CAROL
		Funny, I thought it was a strong 
		point.

				MELVIN
		Write me a note and ain't she 
		sweet. I need a hand and where'd 
		she go.

				CAROL
		Are you saying accepting your help 
		obligates me!?

				MELVIN
		Is there another way to see it?

				CAROL
		No.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf 
	of the closet.

				CAROL
		Well, here's a little suitcase 
		shocked that it's been used.

	She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's 
	too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another 
	drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries 
	of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

	INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER

	Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday 
	"girl Jockies." She fingers the good stuff -- puts it 
	back -- then the everyday -- hesitates.

				CAROL
			(furiously exasperated)
		There's not way to pack for this 
		trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm 
		not packing the camera.

	As she exits the room --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	As she picks up the phone.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly 
	stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a 
	camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items -- 
	underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each 
	one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds 
	another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing 
	development. He has almost no recent experience with 
	receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little 
	comment to himself as he moves.

				MELVIN
		Woo-woo.

	He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is 
	-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but 
	before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his 
	throat.

	ON CAROL

	As she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a 
	pretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)

				CAROL
		Hello?

				MELVIN
		Are you still coming?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	Melvin visibly relaxes.

				CAROL
		Melvin... I'd like to know exactly 
		where we are going.

				MELVIN
		Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. 
		So I know what you're going to ask 
		next.
			(correcting himself)
		That you might ask -- I'm not 
		certain.

				CAROL
		There's... there's no need to 
		bring anything dressy... or... I 
		mean -- I didn't know if we'd be 
		eating at any restaurant that 
		have dress codes.

				MELVIN
		Oh.
			(a beat)
		We might. Yes. We can. Let's.

				CAROL
		Okay, gotcha. What did you think 
		I was going to ask?

				MELVIN
		Whether crabs are in season there 
		now... 

				CAROL
		Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good 
		night.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

				BEVERLY
		How was it talking to him?

				CAROL
		Stop treating this like I'm going 
		away with a man. He's just going 
		to say those crappy, sick, 
		complaining, angry things to me. 
		I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. 
		He's a freak show -- the worst 
		person I ever met.

				BEVERLY
		Well, maybe he has nice friends.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches. 
	She kisses them.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		You stand there and I'll wave to 
		you from the back window.

	As she boards the bus.

				BEVERLY
		Call me as soon as you're settled.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		I love you.

	The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them 
	open.

				CAROL
			(to bus driver)
		Sensitive, huh?!

	The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at 
	his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing 
	himself.

	INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

	A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as 
	Melvin finishes filling out some forms.

	On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black 
	dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

				VETERINARIAN
		Anything unusual in the dog's 
		diet?

				MELVIN
		No. Everybody gets their own 
		cage?

				VETERINARIAN
		Certainly.

				MELVIN
			(pointing to 
			Chihuahua)
		Put him in with that one, not that 
		one... 
			(pointing to large 
			dog)
		... Builds his confidence.

	EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	Carol disembarks.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	As she walks and turns a corner.

	CLOSE ON CAROL

	The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death 
	chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do 
	not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws" 
	will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect 
	couldn't be grimmer.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the 
	tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the 
	building.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry that I'm not taking 
		you.

				SIMON
			(upset)
		So am I, Frank.

	Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

				MELVIN
		Soak it up -- it's your last 
		chance at a hug for a few days.

	As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor 
	changes... that quickly there is a shyness.

				CAROL
		Hi.

				MELVIN
		Thanks for being on time... Carol, 
		the waitress, this is Simon, the 
		fag.

				CAROL
		Hello... Oh, my God, who did that 
		to you?

				SIMON
		I, uh... I was... attacked. 
		Walked in on people robbing me. I 
		was hospitalized. I almost died.

				MELVIN
		Let's do the small talk in the 
		car. Load up.

	Carol puts her bag in the car.

				MELVIN
		I was going to do that for you.

				CAROL
			(taken aback)
		It's okay. No problem. Where 
		should we sit?

				MELVIN
			(totally non-plussed)
		I -- uh, I... Well, there is no 
		place cards or anything.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me go in back. You look like 
		you need all the room you can 
		manage.

				SIMON
		That's very thoughtful.

				MELVIN
		Never a break. Never.

	Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's 
	not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small 
	back seat. She struggles to get her feet in. 

				MELVIN
		You're really jammed back there.

	He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his 
	seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving 
	Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel. 
	She is startled by the gesture.

				CAROL
		Thanks, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		Welcome.

	And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

	EXT. 12TH STREET

	Turning onto Fifth.

				MELVIN
		I got the whole ride programmed.

	CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all 
	carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the 
	one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly 
	and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick 
	burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

				MELVIN
		Just wanted to see what you'd do. 
		No, we have greatness here.

	He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS 
	UP."

	The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY 
	SELECTED MUSIC.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		Hey, I like this music.

	And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	The three of them... Carol chattering away.

				CAROL
		I don't know the last time I've 
		been out of the city... Hey, my 
		arms are tanning. I used to tan 
		great. We gotta stop soon so'se 
		I can check on Spencer.

				SIMON
			(during the above)
		I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I 
		can't turn my head all the way 
		yet... tell her we can't hear her.

				MELVIN
		Doesn't matter. She's enjoying 
		herself. Consider it part of the 
		music.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	A short time later. Carol is now driving.

				CAROL
		I'm sure, Simon, they did 
		something real off for you to feel 
		this way... But when it comes to 
		your partners -- or your kid -- 
		things will always be off for you 
		unless you set it straight. Maybe 
		this thing happened to you just to 
		give you that chance.

				MELVIN
		Nonsense!

				CAROL
		Anybody here who's interested in 
		what Melvin has to say raise their 
		hands.

	Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus 
	declared their majority.

				SIMON
		Do you want to know what happened 
		with my parents?

				CAROL
		Yes. I really would.

				SIMON
		Well... 

				CAROL
		No, let me pull over so I can pay 
		full attention.

	Car pulling over toward parking spot.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY

	She takes the car curbside and parks.

				CAROL
		Now go ahead.

	Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks 
	innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something 
	-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

				SIMON
		Well, I always painted. Always. 
		And my mother always encouraged 
		it. She was sort of fabulous 
		about it actually... and she used 
		to... I was too young to think 
		there was anything at all wrong 
		with it... and she was very 
		natural. She used to pose nude 
		for me... and I thought or assumed 
		my father was aware of it.

				MELVIN
		This stuff is pointless.

				CAROL
		Hey -- you let him... 

				MELVIN
		You like sad stories -- you want 
		mine.

				CARL
		. Go ahead, Simon. Really. 
		Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

				SIMON
		Okay. Well, one day my father 
		came in on one of those painting 
		sessions when I was nine -- and he 
		just started screaming at her -- 
		at us -- at evil. And... 

				MELVIN
			(very quickly)
		... my father didn't leave his 
		room for 11 years -- he hit my 
		hand with a yardstick if I made a 
		mistake on the piano.

				CAROL
		Go ahead, Simon. Your father 
		walked in on you and was yelling 
		and... really, come on.

				SIMON
		I was trying to defend my mother 
		and make peace, in the lamest way. 
		I said, "she's not naked -- it's 
		art." And then he started hitting 
		me. And he beat me unconscious. 
		After that he talked to me less 
		and less -- he knew before I left 
		for college, my dad came into my 
		room. He held out his hand. It 
		was filled with money. A big wad 
		of sweaty money.
			(gathers himself)
		And he said to me, "I don't want 
		you to ever come back." I grabbed 
		him and I hugged him... He turns 
		and walked out.

	Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as 
	strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so 
	much more complicated than her meat and potatoes 
	troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her 
	fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, 
	understated, gesture of friendship.

				CAROL
		Well, you know -- I still stay 
		what I said. You've got to get 
		past it all when it comes to your 
		parents. We all have these horror 
		stories to get over.

	Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

				MELVIN
		That's not true. Some of us have 
		great stories... pretty stories 
		that take place at lakes with 
		boats and friends and noodle 
		salad. Just not anybody in this 
		car. But lots of people -- that's 
		their story -- good times and 
		noodle salad... and that's what 
		makes it hard. Not that you had 
		it bad but being that pissed that 
		so many had it good.

				CAROL
		No.

				SIMON
		Not it at all, really.

				MELVIN
			(a veteran's irony)
		Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to 
		the hotel. And if you're lucky 
		tomorrow Dad will give you another 
		wad of sweaty money.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY

				MELVIN
		Two bedrooms and the sofa opens... 

	Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		No answer... Maybe we should just 
		drive there tomorrow. Can I have 
		that one?

				MELVIN
		Yes... sure.
			(to Simon)
		I'll take the sofa.

	Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever 
	have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials... 

				CAROL
			(into phone)
		Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are 
		you out of breath? You did?!? 
		That is great... So great... So -- 
		no, wait a second, Spence... 

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially 
	neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.

				MELVIN
		Can I ask you a personal question?

	Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

				MELVIN
		Do you ever get an erection for a 
		woman?

				SIMON
		Melvin... 

				MELVIN
		Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier 
		if you were not... 

				SIMON
		You consider your life easy.

				MELVIN
		I give you that one... 
			(eyes suitcase)
		Nice packing.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting 
	there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new 
	factors in her life.

				CAROL
		My son was outside playing soccer. 
		I never saw him playing ball. Come 
		on, you guys -- take me out for a 
		good time... Take me out dancing.

				MELVIN
		Dancing?

				SIMON
		I can't, I'm exhausted.

	Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is 
	visibly disturbed by her gesture.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		I don't blame you... This is a 
		monumental first day out... You 
		sad or anything?

				SIMON
		No... Nervous. It would be very 
		rough, Carol, if you weren't 
		along.

				CAROL
		What a nice compliment.

	She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy. 
	She turns to him.

				CAROL
		I'm happy. And you're my date. 
		Let's get dressed.

	She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

				MELVIN
		I'm going to jump in the shower. 
		I'll be right with you.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main 
	room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she 
	sits down to wait -- through... 

	SERIES OF DISSOLVES

	Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until 
	finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom 
	through a cloud of steam. They exit.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they drive up.

				VALET
		Good evening, sir.

				MELVIN
		They sell hard shell crabs here?

				VALET
		Yes.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they enters... 

				HEAD WAITER
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		Hi. You have hard shells, right?

				CAROL
		Stop asking everyone.

				MELVIN
		Just him and that's it. Okay, you 
		can answer -- we've worked it out.

				HEAD WAITER
		Yes, we do... And I can give you a 
		tie and jacket.

				MELVIN
		What?

				HEAD WAITER
		They require a tie and jacket but 
		we have some available.

	He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.

				MELVIN
		No... I'm not wearing that -- and 
		just in case you were going to ask 
		I'm not going to let you inject me 
		with plaque either.

				CAROL
		You promised a nice place -- can't 
		you just... 
			(to Head Waiter)
		You have these dry cleaned all the 
		time, don't you?

				HEAD WAITER
		Actually, I don't think so.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Wait here.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.

	EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

	As the car goes right across the street to a shopping 
	mall.

	INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT

	Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.

				SALESMAN
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		I need a coat and tie.

	OTHER ANGLE

	CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so 
	that passage for Melvin is impossible.

				SALESMAN
		Come on in.

				MELVIN
		No.

				SALESMAN
		No?

				MELVIN
			(pointing)
		That jacket and give me a tie.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.

				VALET #2
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		You have hard shells?

				VALET #2
		I'm not sure.

				MELVIN
		Everyone else says you do.

				VALET #2
		Then I guess we do.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT

	As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is 
	having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool -- 
	watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning 
	down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin 
	watches... Watches his date.

				HEAD WAITER
		Shall I get her for you?

				MELVIN
		No, it's all right. I'll just 
		watch.

	He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns 
	-- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture... 
	and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has 
	lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her. 
	She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, 
	giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g. 
	She notices the waiter in her trail.

				CAROL
			(mouthing the words 
			to Melvin)
		My drink is following me.

	Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite. 
	He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.

				CAROL
		You look s... 

	She stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then... 

				CAROL
		You look great.

	They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.

				CAROL
		You wanna dance?

				MELVIN
		I've been thinking about that 
		since you brought it up before.

				CAROL
			(rising)
		And?

				MELVIN
		No... 
			(and before she can 
			digest that)
		... I don't get this place. They 
		make me buy an outfit but they let 
		you wear a house dress. I don't 
		get it.

	ON CAROL

	Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in 
	extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave.

				MELVIN
		No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't 
		mean it. You gotta sit down. You 
		can still give me the dirty 
		look... just sit down and give it 
		to me.

				CAROL
		Melvin, pay me a compliment... I 
		need one and quick... You have no 
		idea how much what you said just 
		hurt my feelings.

				MELVIN
			(really pissed, 
			mutters)
		That monominute somebody gets that 
		you need them they threaten to go 
		away. Never fails.

				CAROL
		That's not compliment, Melvin... 
		That's just trying to sound smart 
		so I feel stupid... A compliment 
		is something nice about somebody 
		else... Now or never.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

	He waves her down.

				CAROL
			(sitting)
		And mean it... 

				MELVIN
		Can we order first?

	She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. 
	This does not stop Melvin.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Two crab dinners and pitcher of 
		cold beer.
			(to Carol)
		Baked or fries?

				CAROL
		Fries.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		One baked -- one fries.

				STARTLED WAITER
			(shouting back)
		I'll tell your waiter.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Okay, I got a real great 
		compliment for you and it's true.

				CAROL
		I am so afraid you're about to say 
		something awful... 

				MELVIN
		Don't be pessimistic. It's not 
		your style. Okay... Here I 
		goes... Clearly a mistake.
			(this is hell 
			for him)
		I have this -- what? Ailment... 
		And my doctor -- a shrink... who 
		I used to see all the time... he 
		says 50 or 60 percent of the time 
		a pill can really help. I hate 
		pills. Very dangerous things, 
		pills. "Hate," I am using the 
		word "hate" about pills. My 
		compliment is that when you came 
		to my house that time and told me 
		how you'd never -- well, you were 
		there, you know... The next 
		morning I started taking these 
		pills.

				CAROL
			(a little confused)
		I don't quite get how that's a 
		compliment for me.

	Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- 
	so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- 
	then:

				MELVIN
		You make me want to be a better 
		man.

	Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so 
	slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered, 
	momentarily moved and his for the taking.

				CAROL
		That's maybe the best compliment 
		of my life.

				MELVIN
		Then I've really overshot here 
		'cause I was aiming at just enough 
		to keep you from walking out.

	Carol laughs.

				CAROL
		So how are you doing with those 
		pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

				MELVIN
		Takes months to know... They work 
		little by little.
			(holds his head; 
			then)
		Talking like this is exhausting.

	Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very 
	close -- he tenses.

				CAROL
		Have you ever let a romantic 
		moment make you do something you 
		know is stupid?

				MELVIN
		Never.

				CAROL
		Here's the trouble with never.

	TIGHT SHOT

	for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at 
	him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him 
	-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves 
	away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But 
	now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is 
	brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. 
	Melvin can't bear the pleasure.

				MELVIN
		You don't owe me that.

				CAROL
		That wasn't payment. When you 
		first came into breakfast, when I 
		saw you -- I thought you were 
		handsome... Then, of course, you 
		spoke... So now that your soft 
		li'l underbelly is all exposed. 
		Tell me, why did you bring me?

	Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable... 
	as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.

				MELVIN
		Well, ah... that's a personal 
		question.

				CAROL
		Tell me even if you're scared. 
		Tell me why you wanted me here. 
		It's okay.

	She kisses him again.

				CAROL
		If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

				MELVIN
			(dissembling)
		There are lots of reason... I had 
		a thought that if you had sex with 
		Simon it might... 

				CAROL
			(humiliated)
		Sex with Simon?

				MELVIN
		It's one idea... 

				CAROL
		That's why you brought me? Look 
		at me! Is that really why you 
		brought me... Like I'm a what and 
		I owe you what?!

				MELVIN
		I don't know why I brought you -- 
		that idea occurred to me is all... 
		It came out first... Hey, you kiss 
		him -- me... He says he loves 
		you. You two hit it off. But you 
		don't want to... fine... Forget 
		what I said about sex with Simon. 
		It was a mistake.

				CAROL
			(wiping away tears)
		I'll never forget you said it.

				MELVIN
		It was a mistake.

	But she has already turned away and exits the 
	restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.

	INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not 
	breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let 
	the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice, 
	then a humorless male voice:

				PARENTS' VOICE
			(humorless male 
			voice)
		Hi. This is Fred Bishop... 
			(perky woman's 
			voice)
		... and Betty.
			(Fred again)
		We are sorry to be unable to take 
		your call right now. Please leave 
		a message and we'd appreciate your 
		including the time/date and 
		purpose of your call.
			(Simon mouths the 
			word "date," then 
			Betty speaks before 
			the beep Bye-bye.

				SIMON
		Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in 
		town... 
			(he waits)
		... and, folks, you haven't come 
		home later than 10 in your lives. 
		Please pick up -- really... 
		Okay... I'm going to call again in 
		the morning. I need to see you. 
		Or, at least get you to answer the 
		phone.

	He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he 
	needs help.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she 
	goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing 
	things in.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT

				SIMON
		Hello... Hello???

	Carol thrusts open the door and enters... 

				SIMON
		Was this supposed to be your room?

				CAROL
		Our room. I don't want to see him 
		and he's not going to come 
		knocking on your door.

	Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, 
	inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.

				SIMON
		Can you not be violent?

				CAROL
		I don't think so. You need help 
		with the pants?

				SIMON
			(emphatically)
		No!!!

				CAROL
		I'm going to take a big bath and 
		order a big meal.

				SIMON
		Uh-huh... 

				CAROL
		I'm sorry... are you okay?

				SIMON
		Well, considering everything's 
		horrible and tomorrow I have to 
		face my parents... Don't ask me
		... I'm sick of my own complaints
		... got to get me a new set of 
		thoughts.

				CAROL
		Why? What have you been thinking 
		about?

				SIMON
		How to die, mostly.

				CAROL
		Can you believe in our little mix 
		you're the good roommate.

	Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins 
	to prepare a bath.

				SIMON
			(turning off the light)
		Good night.

				CAROL
		Good night.

	We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or 
	sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he 
	faces the bathroom and we have... 

	SIMON'S POV

	Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now 
	as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair 
	-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast 
	exposed... 

	BACK TO SCENE

				SIMON
			(a whisper)
		Hold it.

	He leaves the bed.

	ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK

	What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set 
	and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair 
	and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of 
	the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

				SIMON
		I've got to sketch you.

				CAROL
		No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer 
		than you think. I give the wrong 
		impression sometimes and... 

				SIMON
		I haven't even been thinking about 
		sketching for weeks.

				CAROL
		Stop staring. Do a vase.

				SIMON
		But you're beautiful... your skin 
		glows.

				CAROL
		Thanks. But I just want to take a 
		bath and... 

				SIMON
		That long neck -- the line of 
		you... you're porcelain... your 
		back goes on forever. You're 
		classic... you're why cavemen 
		chiseled on walls... 

				CAROL
		All right, cut me a break.

	Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him 
	earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly 
	but deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right. 
	She's breathtaking.

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to 
	the bartender.

				MELVIN
		So then, the next thing I know, 
		she's sitting right next to me, 
		and then, well, it's not right to 
		go into the details, but I screwed 
		up. I got nervous. I said the 
		wrong thing and if I hadn't, I 
		could be in bed now with a woman 
		who if you could make her smile 
		you got a life. Instead, I'm here 
		with you, no offense, a moron 
		pushing the last legal drug.

	He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his 
	heart breaking.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT

	He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		I don't care how you put it -- 
		We're being naughty here, pal.

	FULL SHOT

	Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a 
	ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His 
	style cramped by his cast.

				SIMON
		No. No. This is great, this is 
		so great. I can't get the angle 
		with this cast.

	He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle 
	no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece 
	from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- 
	a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin is having a room service breakfast.

	The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better 
	than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

				MELVIN
		Did you have sex with her?

	Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the 
	hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.

				MELVIN
		Sorry, didn't realize she was 
		right there.
			(a beat)
		Did you have sex with her?

				CAROL
		To hell with sex.

	Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.

				CAROL
		We held each other. It was better 
		than sex. What I need he gave me 
		great.

				SIMON
		I just love her.
			(beat)
		How're you doing?

	Melvin reacts.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

	Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:

				SIMON
		Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely 
		hear you. Do you have to whisper? 
		No -- don't apologize -- it was 
		the luckiest thing for all of us 
		that you didn't answer last 
		night... I can't hear you... okay, 
		dear, just listen to me then.

	ON MELVIN AND CAROL

	Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings 
	the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in 
	her suitcase.

				MELVIN
		I get why you're angry. It's no 
		snap to explain why I was like 
		that, but let's not try to do it 
		on the run... 

				SIMON
		... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- 
		truly. A little odd that you 
		didn't come to see me when you 
		heard I was hurt, but the 
		important thing I want you to know 
		is your son is happy. I'm working 
		again. I'll make do -- I don't 
		want a thing. Wouldn't take it if 
		it was offered. I'll drop you a 
		note from wherever I land and then 
		it's up to you. I hope we patch 
		things up but know that if we 
		don't, I wish you both the very 
		best... I can't hear you. You 
		heard me, though, right? Good -- 
		take good care. 'Bye.

	He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over 
	to Carol and Melvin.

				MELVIN
		... Now he's going to want to 
		stay. And they'll want to take a 
		ride to the lake or whatever. So 
		it's a good five hours back. It 
		gives us a chance to take it easy 
		and... 

				SIMON
		I'm going back with you.

				CAROL
		But what about... 

				SIMON
		I'll take care of myself --

				MELVIN
		What are you talking about? You 
		got real problems.

				SIMON
		I know. I'm a little bit nervous. 
		Suddenly everything seems so easy. 
		Carol, a load has been lifted.

				CAROL
		One night with me!

				SIMON
		You think you're kidding.

	Melvin stalks out.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The car parked near a phone booth --

				MELVIN
			(to Frank over 
			the phone)
		Aww Jesus! No choice.

	Carol walks up to Simon in the car.

				CAROL
		I got a gift for you.

	She hands him a base ball cap.

				MELVIN
			(on phone)
		Nothing like no choice to make you 
		feel at home.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!

				MELVIN
		Do it then. Get the dog picked 
		up. I can't believe you let it 
		stay there.

	Melvin hangs up the phone.

				MELVIN
		Good-bye.
			(to Simon)
		Well, your luck is holding. They 
		sublet your place. You're 
		homeless. Frank's got a line on 
		another place you can use for now.

				SIMON
		Another place where?

				MELVIN
		Does it matter?

	Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a 
	special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it 
	PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:

				CAROL
		I don't want to hear that music 
		right now.

				MELVIN
		What do you mean? You said you 
		liked it.

				CAROL
		I don't.

				MELVIN
		This one has a special meaning.

				CAROL
		It's your car but I don't want to 
		hear it. If that means anything.

	Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
	proclamation of love.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT

	As the car arrives... They get out... 

				MELVIN
		Here are the keys to my apartment. 
		I'm going to park you in my place 
		while I take Carol home.

				CAROL
			(hefting bag)
		I'll take a bus.

				MELVIN
		I'll take you... why not?

				CAROL
		I don't care what you did for me. 
		I don't think I want to know you 
		anymore -- all you do is make me 
		feel badly about myself.
			(turning to Simon)
		You have my number.

				SIMON
			(hugging her)
		I love you... 
			(sotto)
		Let him take you home.

				CAROL
		Don't want to. I love you.

	She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at 
	Melvin with some sympathy.

				MELVIN
		Don't say anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Where Verdell's ears prick.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As they enter.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I told you to go on in.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Look, I've got to get a hold of 
		Frank and see where I'm hanging my 
		hat 'cause... 

	The door opens, revealing them:

				MELVIN
		I think you gotta camp it here... 

				SIMON
		What are you talking about?

	The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the 
	dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		I know the feeling -- you feel 
		like your ol' self again, huh? --
		Mommy and Daddy are home.

	Melvin reacts.

				SIMON
		Sorry... You're fun to mess with.
	
	Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.

				MELVIN
		They took your place furnished. 
		Jackie said she grabbed your 
		personal stuff -- they were 
		supposed to set you up here.
			(leading the way)
		There's this extra room -- I 
		never use. It gets good light. 
		No other answer really.

	Simon follows.

	INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

	As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small 
	but lovely garret.

				SIMON
		Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm 
		me.

				MELVIN
		They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?

				SIMON
		I love you.

	Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.

				MELVIN
		I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the 
		luckiest guy alive if that did it 
		for me.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and 
	Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each 
	around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully 
	dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we 
	hear Simon's whispered voice.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Where is my big hairy boy?

	Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest 
	approaches.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Verdell, sweeties?

	Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.

				SIMON
		Sorry, didn't know you were awake. 
		I just thought Verdell shouldn't 
		get too used to sleeping in here 
		'cause then... 

				MELVIN
		Look, we both want the dog -- 
		and... 

	The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin 
	doesn't move.

				SIMON
		Should I get it?

	Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several 
	beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Hello.

	ON SIMON

				SIMON
			(into phone)
		Hello. It's me. He took me in. 
		Did you know? Hold on, I'll get 
		him for you.

	He walks back to Melvin's room.

	INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As he enters.

				SIMON
		It's Carol.

	Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one 
	mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.

				MELVIN
		Here. Take the dog.

	As he speeds him out... 

				SIMON
		Good luck.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat 
	loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin 
	-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat 
	clearing.

				MELVIN
		Hello.

				CAROL
		Yeah... Well... 

				MELVIN
			(very concerned)
		How you doing?

				CAROL
		I can trust my brain.

				MELVIN
		That seems like a good choice.

				CAROL
		I don't know whether I'm being 
		sensible or hard on you.

				MELVIN
		The two might go together.

				CAROL
		See. There's an example. I don't 
		know whether you're being cute or 
		crazy now.

				MELVIN
			(what the hell)
		Cute.

				CAROL
		You don't have to answer 
		everything I say. Just listen to 
		me. Okay?

	He nods his head, "yes."

				CAROL
		It's really something that you're 
		looking after Simon. And what I 
		said on the street. That was a 
		bad thing to say. And it made me 
		sick to my stomach. It was a bad 
		thing to say. And I'd be lying if 
		I didn't say that I enjoyed your 
		company... but the truth is you do 
		bother me enormously and I know -- 
		think -- that it's best for me to 
		not have contact with you because 
		you're just not ready and you're a 
		pretty old guy to not be ready... 
		and I'm too old to ignore that. 
		But there were extraordinary 
		kindnesses that did take place. 
		So thanks for the trips... 

	She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than 
	ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.

				MELVIN
		Okay to say something now?

				CAROL
		Go ahead.

				MELVIN
		I should've danced with you.

				CAROL
		Okay. Good-bye.

				MELVIN
		So long.

	Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped. 
	Oh, hell... she missed him.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He 
	is impatient.

				MELVIN
		You going to come talk to me or 
		not?

				SIMON
		I'm coming.

	We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be 
	allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.

				SIMON
		What did she say?

				MELVIN
		I'm a great guy -- 
		"extraordinary"... 
			(before Simon can 
			celebrate)
		... and she doesn't want contact 
		with me.
			(a beat)
		I'm dying here.

				SIMON
		Because... 
			(gently)
		... you love her?

				MELVIN
			(sharply)
		No... and you're supposed to be 
		sensitive and sharp.

				SIMON
		Okay... you tell me why --
			(mimics him)
		"You're dying here."

				MELVIN
		I don't know... Let me sleep on it 
		and figure it out.
			(then)
		Because I'm stuck! Can't go back 
		to what I had... She's evicted me 
		from my life.

				SIMON
		Did you like it that much?

				MELVIN
			(furiously)
		It was better than this... Look, 
		you, I'm very intelligent. If 
		you're going to give me advice or 
		conversation or consolation or 
		hope, you got to be better than 
		you're doing. If you can't be at 
		least momentarily interesting than 
		shut the hell up. I'm drowning 
		and you're describing water.

				SIMON
			(getting pissed)
		Picking on me won't help.

				MELVIN
		Well, if that's true then I'm 
		really in trouble.

				SIMON
		But you know where you're lucky?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely not.

				SIMON
		You know who you want. I'll take 
		your seat any day. So do 
		something... don't sleep on it... 
		go over there. I don't think 
		anybody should ever sleep on 
		anything -- it's not always good 
		to let things calm down.

				MELVIN
		Hey... I'm charged here. But she 
		might kill me for showing up this 
		late.

				SIMON
		Then get in your jammies and I'll 
		read you a story... I think you've 
		got a chance. The only real enemy 
		you have is her ability to think 
		logically -- the best thing you 
		have going for you is your 
		willingness to humiliate yourself 
		if it gives you one chance in 
		whatever -- so go catch her off-
		guard.

				MELVIN
		Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

	He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				MELVIN
		I forgot to lock the door.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - 
	NIGHT

	As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at 
	his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the 
	apartment house.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great 
	uncertainty.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting 
	directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading 
	one of Melvin's books... 

	There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL... 
	someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly 
	-- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL -- 
	until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to 
	her wide open window and looks over.

	HER POV

	The convertible at the curb.

	BACK TO SCENE

	She hesitates --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the 
	sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. 
	He bolts for the door and enters.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN 
	SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.

				CAROL
		What do you want, Melvin?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What do you want?

				MELVIN
		'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm 
		sorry. And you could be grouchy.

				CAROL
		Grouchy?

				MELVIN
		... 'Cause of being woken up, and 
		it would make my job impossible. 
		So then I wouldn't even try.

				CAROL
		What job?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Beverly in the hallway looking on --

	BACK TO SCENE

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry I woke you -- some other 
		time.

	He half turns to leave.

				CAROL
		I wasn't asleep!!

				MELVIN
		What a break... 

				CAROL
			(losing it a bit)
		Is it a secret what you're doing 
		here?

				MELVIN
		I had to see you... 

				CAROL
		Because... 

				MELVIN
		It relaxes me... I'd feel better 
		just sitting on the curb in front 
		of your house than anyplace else 
		I can think of or imagine.

	Carol has not ever heard anything like that before... 
	it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her 
	door down the hallway, has heard at least this last 
	part... 

	Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone... 

				MELVIN
			(serious)
		Wait a minute, I'm overstating 
		here, maybe the inside stairs. I 
		don't want to sit with my feet in 
		the gutter. What does that serve? 
		It only... 

	But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

				CAROL
		Stop it!! Why can't I have a 
		normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out 
		of here. Just a regular boyfriend 
		who doesn't go nuts on me... 

				BEVERLY
			(butting in)
		Everybody wants that, dear -- it 
		doesn't exit... 
			(as Carol turns 
			to her)
		Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

	She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh -- 
	gathers herself. A beat.

				MELVIN
			(hopefully)
		Boyfriend?

				CAROL
		Oh, come on in and try not to ruin 
		everything by being you.

				MELVIN
		Maybe we could live without the 
		wise cracks.

	She looks at him -- then:

				CAROL
		Maybe we could... 

	Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen 
	linoleum and stalls at the door.

				MELVIN
		It feels a little confined here. 
		Let's take a walk.

				CAROL
		See. It's four in the morning. A 
		walk sounds a little screwy to me, 
		if you don't mind.

				MELVIN
		If you need an excuse, there's a 
		bakery on the corner. There's a 
		shot it'll open soon -- that way 
		we're not screwy -- we're just 
		two people who like warm rolls.

				CAROL
		Okay.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT

	They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual 
	attention to where he steps.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement -- 
	it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids 
	stepping on the lines.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing 
	down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious 
	-- his habits making him appear unworthy.

				CAROL
			(gently; almost 
			lovingly)
		I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever 
		this is -- is not going to work.

	ON MELVIN

	He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper 
	something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his 
	history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.

				MELVIN
		I'm feeling... I've been feeling 
		better.

				CAROL
		Melvin, even though it may seem 
		that way now -- you don't know me 
		all that well... 
			(as he scoffs)
		I'm not the answer for you.

	She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns 
	back to him.

				MELVIN
		Hey, I've got a great compliment 
		for you.

				CAROL
		You know what? I... 

				MELVIN
		Just let me talk.
			(gathers himself 
			with uncertainty, 
			then:)
		I'm the only one on the face of 
		the earth who realizes that you're 
		the greatest woman on earth. I'm 
		the only one who appreciates how 
		amazing you are in every single 
		thing you do -- in every single 
		thought you have... in how you 
		are with Spencer -- Spence... 
			(he has reached 
			her)
		... in how you say what you mean 
		and how you almost always mean 
		something that's all about being 
		straight and good... 

	ON CAROL

	She stands on the precipice of being transported away 
	from the logic which has been her lifeline.

				MELVIN
		I think most people miss that 
		about you and I watch wondering 
		how they can watch you bring them 
		food and clear their dishes and 
		never get that they have just met 
		the greatest woman alive... And 
		the fact that I get it makes me 
		feel great... about me!
			(a real question 
			filled with 
			concern for her)
		You got a real good reason to walk 
		out on that?

	That last question clearly a true question, not the least 
	rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

				CAROL
		No! It's certainly not. No -- I 
		don't think so. No.

				MELVIN
			(tentatively)
		I'm gonna grab you.
			(with conviction)
		I didn't mean it to be a question. 
		I'm gonna grab you.

	He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate. 
	A tense beat. Then:

				MELVIN
		I know I can do better.

	They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A 
	first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot 
	land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his 
	knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a 
	notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in 
	unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a 
	path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the 
	bakery turn on as it opens for business.

				CAROL
		Warm rolls... 

	They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As 
	they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to 
	clean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto 
	a crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous 
	fact and joins Carol inside as we:

	FADE IN:

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an 
	enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up 
	against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the 
	unseen love of her long life.

			SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I'm just going to get some 
		flowers, dear. I'll be back in 
		twenty minutes. It's tulip season 
		today. I'm so happy.

	And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness 
	dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that 
	quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her 
	apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

	POV - MELVIN UDALL

	in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, 
	unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever 
	met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength 
	is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the 
	elevator door he holds open.

			MELVIN
		Come here, sweetheart... come on.

	ON DOG

	Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. 
	Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the 
	mutt who has ignores him.

			MELVIN
		Wanna go for a ride? Okay, 
		sweetie?

	The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges 
	and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog 
	urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG 
	sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

			MELVIN
			(a malevolent tone)
		You've pissed your last floor, you 
		dog-eared monkey.

	The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much 
	meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout 
	shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the 
	garbage chute.
				
			MELVIN
		I'll bet you wish you were some 
		sort of real dog now, huh? Don't 
		worry...  this is New York. If you 
		can make it here, you can make it 
		anywhere, you know? You ugly, 
		smelly fuck.

	And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and 
	lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS" 
	from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment 
	door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON 
	NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with 
	Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of 
	trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about 
	to enter his apartment.

			SIMON
		Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie... 

	He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.
			
			SIMON
		Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey 
		there!
			(as Melvin turns)
		Have you seen Verdell?

			MELVIN
		What's he look like?

	Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is 
	directly opposite Simon's.

			SIMON
		My dog... you know... I mean my 
		little dog with the adorable 
		face... Don't you know what my dog 
		looks like?

			MELVIN
		I got it. You're talking about 
		your dog. I thought that was the 
		name of the colored man I've been 
		seeing in the hall.

	Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

			SIMON
		Which color was that?

			MELVIN
		Like thick molasses, with one of 
		those wide noses perfect for 
		smelling trouble and prison 
		food... 

	Simon has had it.

			SIMON
		Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

			MELVIN
			(not missing a beat)
		How're you doing?

				SIMON
		Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I 
		think you know that.

				FRANK
			(overlapping)
		Simon, you've got to get dressed.

				MELVIN
			(to Simon)
		What I know is that as long as you 
		keep your work zipped up around 
		me, I don't give a fuck what or 
		where you shove your show. Are we 
		being neighbors for now?

				SIMON
			(to Frank)
		Do you still think I was 
		exaggerating?

	FRANK can only smile.

				FRANK
		Definitely a package you don't 
		want to open or touch.

				MELVIN
		Hope you find him. I love that 
		dog.

	Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds 
	himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

				SIMON
			(directly)
		You don't love anything, Mr. 
		Udall.

	Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the 
	hallway.

				MELVIN
		I love throwing your dog down the 
		garbage chute.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to 
	five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and 
	off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards 
	his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens 
	the medicine chest.

	INT. MEDICINE CHEST

	Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps 
	one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the 
	process two more times.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

	A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN 
	holding Verdell who looks and finds:

	SIMON

	who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves 
	quickly toward the group and his dog.

				SIMON
		Thank the good Lord... wow... my 
		honey... where have you been?

				PARTY GOER
			(thinking the greeting's 
			for him)
		He always liked me.

	As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the 
	Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a 
	laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As 
	the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. 
	Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks 
	some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts 
	Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS 
	in protest.

				SIMON
		Just for a second, okay?

	The DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

				SIMON
			(kissing him on the mouth)
		Look at him...  where was little 
		baby?

				HANDYMAN
			(smiling)
		In the basement garbage bin eating 
		diaper shit.

	Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in 
	cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.

				SIMON
		Go ahead, John, you earned your fun.
			(looking at Verdell)
		How did he get down in the 
		basement? I mean even if he got 
		on the elevator how... ?

				HANDYMAN
		Maybe some nice neighbor shoved 
		him down the garbage chute.

				SIMON
		My God! No!

	He stares out... Frank frustrated following.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT

	Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he 
	writes.

				MELVIN
		'Somewhat in the dark, she had 
		confessed and he had forgiven. 
		This is what you live for, he 
		said. Two heads on a pillow where 
		there is only the safety of being 
		with each other. How, she 
		wondered, could she find such hope 
		in the most shameful part of her.'

	He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall.

	But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

				MELVIN
		'At last she was able to define 
		love. Love was... '

	More KNOCKING.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you 
		please.

				MELVIN
		'Love was... '

	He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of 
	love -- but the knocking throws him.

				MELVIN
		... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
		stool-pusher.

	He burst from his chair.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step 
	back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

				MELVIN
			(loud and angry)
		Yeeeess!!!

				SIMON
		Maybe this can wait.

	Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

				SIMON
		I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

				MELVIN
		Well, that's a load off.

	Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to 
	close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

				SIMON
		Did you... do something to him?

				MELVIN
		Do you realize that I work at 
		him?

				SIMON
			(eyes downcast)
		No, I didn't.

				MELVIN
		Do you like to be interrupt when 
		you are danging around in your 
		little garden?

				SIMON
		No...  actually, I even shut the 
		phone off and put a little piece 
		of cardboard in the ringer so no 
		one can just buzz me from d... 

				MELVIN
		Well, I work all the time. So 
		never, never again interrupt me. 
		Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 
		years from now... not if there's 
		fire. Not even if you hear a thud 
		from inside my home and a week 
		later there's a smell from in 
		there that can only come from a 
		decaying body and you have to hold 
		a hanky against your face because 
		the stench is so thick you think 
		you're going to faint even then 
		don't come knocking or, if it's 
		election night and you're excited 
		and want to celebrate because some 
		fudge-packer you dated has been 
		elected the first queer President 
		of the United States... and he's 
		going to put you up in Camp David 
		and you just want to share the 
		moment with someone...  don't knock
		...  not on this door. Not for 
		anything. Got me. Sweetheart?

				SIMON
		Yes. It's not a subtle point 
		you're making.

				MELVIN
		Okay, then.

	Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

				SIMON
		So the theory of confrontations is 
		that now he'll think twice before 
		messing with me?

	Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

				SIMON
		He's genuinely upsetting, isn't 
		he?

				FRANK
		Won't worry about it. You go 
		ahead.

	Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly 
	on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really 
		pissed!!!

	Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. 
	Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him 
	forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

				MELVIN
		No touch. No touch. No touch.

				FRANK
		You may think you can intimidate 
		the whole world with your 
		attitude, but I grew up in Hell. 
		My grandmother had more attitude. 
		You don't intimidate me.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Police! Police! Fucking crooked 
		police...  doughnut-munching morons 
		help me!
			(to Frank)
		Assault and battery and you're 
		black.

				FRANK
		Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like 
		him enough to batter you 
		unrecognizable if you verbally 
		abuse him or so much as touch his 
		dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try 
		and think how you can make this up 
		to him.
			(suddenly loud)
		I hate doing this. I'm an art 
		dealer.
			(beat)
		Have a nice day. Party!

	He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens 
	his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as 
	he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears 
	impressed.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His 
	walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the 
	danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. 
	At times he places his palms together and extends his 
	arms cutting a path through people. We will be very 
	pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	His eyes focused on the terrain.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	ANGLE ON WAITRESS

	CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. 
	You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be 
	the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a 
	story about her son for the umpteenth time.

				CAROL
			(to the Mother's 
			little girl)
		Look at you, you're all better.

				MOTHER
		It's that new medication.

				CAROL
		You know all my son's stuff, 
		right?

	The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but 
	Carol interrupts her.

				CAROL
		No, no, no, I got a date tonight. 
		I'm walking out the door this 
		morning and he says to me, 'Mom, 
		I promise not to get one of my 
		fevers or coughs during your 
		date.'

				MOTHER
		Isn't that sweet.

				CAROL
		Little blonde angle.
			(to child, 
			affectionately)
		Eat everything.

	Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a 
	table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find 
	a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.

				WOMAN
		It just came out of me. I said 
		you love me the way a remote 
		control loves a TV. As long as I 
		switch every time... 

				HER MALE COMPANION
		Wonderful.

				MELVIN
		People who talk in metaphors can 
		shampoo my crotch.
			(on their look)
		Eat up.

	They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the 
	waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, 
	are talking.

				LISA
		Pay me back next week.

				CAROL
		I owe you. I told you today... 
		them's the rules. Oh, excuse me, 
		Melvin.

	She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out 
	of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else 
	ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

				MELVIN
		I'm starving.

				CAROL
			(firmly to Lisa)
		Will you please take it?

	Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with 
	stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out 
	of the way... 

				LISA
		This way you take a cab home so 
		you have time to get ready for the 
		date.

				CAROL
		"Ready" is not my problem.

	She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could 
	read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the 
	date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

				CAROL
			(to Melvin)
		Go sit down. You know you're not 
		allowed back here...  Spencer's 
		more excited about it than I am... 
		He says, "Mom, I promise not to 
		get a fever or couch during your date."

	The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go 
	"awww."

				CAROL
		I know. He's just the best.

				MELVIN
		I've got Jews at my table.

				CAROL
		It's not your table. It's the 
		place's table. Behave. This 
		once, you can sit at someone 
		else's station.

	The two waitresses signal their protests.

				CAROL
		Or you can just wait your turn... 

	Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs 
	near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo... 
	then:

				MELVIN
		How much more you got to eat? 
		Your appetite isn't as big as 
		your noses, is it?

				WOMAN
		What?!!

				MAN
			(to Woman)
		Let's go --

	The Woman starts to protest.

				MAN
		Let's leave. We're going.

	Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his 
	pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. 
	As he opens his utensils.

				CAROL
		Bryan says he doesn't care how 
		long you've been coming you ever 
		act like this again you're barred 
		for life. I'm gonna miss the 
		excitement, but I'll handle it.

	There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some 
	ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only 
	one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear 
	the table.

				MELVIN
		The table's fine if it had some 
		cholesterol on it. Two sausages, 
		six bacon strips, fries, three 
		eggs over easy and coffee.

				CAROL
		You're gonna die soon with that 
		diet, you know that?

				MELVIN
		We're all gonna die soon. I will. 
		You will. It sure sounds like 
		your son will.

	ON CAROL

	Stunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her 
	perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin 
	senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.

				CAROL
		If you ever mention my son again, 
		you will never be able to eat here 
		again. Do you understand? Give me 
		some sign you understand or leave 
		now. Do you understand me... 
			(adds truthful label)
		you crazy freak? Do you?!?

	A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing 
	down.

				CAROL
		Okay. I'll get your order.

	She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower 
	lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room 
	sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make 
	noises as she responds...  each time startling herself 
	with her own noise and trying to reign it in.

	She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway 
	-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the 
	emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young 
	Man stops and looks at her.

				YOUNG MAN
		What?

				CAROL
		I...  I...  I don't know...  You got 
		me.

	His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited 
	but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the 
	fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her 
	mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt 
	opening her mouth. She stops him.

				CAROL
		Let me just do whatever I do by 
		myself...  I'll catch up to you 
		someplace I promise.
			(as he's put off)
		Oh, no...  don't look like that. 
		No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

	And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed 
	the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about 
	egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when 
	we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and 
	COUGHING.

				CAROL
		Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.

	Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

				SPENCER (O.S.)
			(softly)
		Grandma, grandma... 

				YOUNG MAN
		Maybe you better check.

				CAROL
		Like what did you think I was 
		going to do?

	INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... 
	she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her 
	mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... 
	she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the 
	cough.

				BEVERLY
		I'm sorry. I was hearing just 
		everything you were doing so I put 
		these on to give you privacy.

	Carol now goes into her son's room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... 
	two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer 
	(breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand 
	filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with 
	some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged 
	into the tiny space.

				SPENCER
		I'm sorry.

				CAROL
		Don't be silly. How bad?

				SPENCER
		Not bad.

	Carol feels his head...  that's okay. Then he coughs -- 
	trying to suppress it...  then a bigger cough...  they each 
	know what that signals...  She brings up a waste basket as 
	he throws up...  she comforts him. He apologizes. She 
	loves him.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

				CAROL
			(a bit panicked)
		You can't smoke...  He can't take 
		smoke.

	He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand 
	squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his 
	hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he 
	picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking 
	at her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to 
	cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.

				CAROL
		Oh, God...  I don't even notice 
		anymore.

	She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make 
	light.

				CAROL
		That'll teach you.

				YOUNG MAN
		Don't apologize.

				CAROL
			(perturbed)
		That wasn't an apology.

	She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her -- 
	how uncomfortable he is.

				CAROL
		Hey...  this is just a little throw-
		up -- it's nothing to be so 
		embarrassed about. Really.
			(as he shifts 
			uncomfortably)
		Thanks for the dinner. Let me 
		write down which trains you take 
		to get back.

				YOUNG MAN
		No way.

	She brightens.

				YOUNG MAN
		I'll take a cab.

	She deflates as he moves past her.

				YOUNG MAN
		Too much reality for a Friday 
		night.

	EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT

	A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the 
	approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN 
	and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and 
	the most likeable of the gritty little trio.

				EVAN
		Why is every customer surprised I 
		read books?

				DOUG
			(amazed)
		You read books?

				EVAN
		Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! 
		He even bought me dinner.

	They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in 
	front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through 
	the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

				CARL
			(slightly exasperated)
		Look, I just can't. I promised 
		Simon I'd find him a model.

				FRIEND (V.O.)
			(on speaker phone,
			flirting)
		Carl, take me off the speaker. 
		Did I tell you that these are 
		house seats? C'mon, you could use 
		a break. Hello...  Carl, are you 
		there...  hello?

	Seeing the hustlers:

				CARL
.		...  I just found a model.

				DOUG
			(to Carl)
		Hey, how it's goin'... 

				EVAN
		Hey, hi...  remember?

				CARL
		I only need one.

				EVAN
		You picked me up, maybe a few 
		weeks, I don't know, some time 
		ago. You were very flattering 
		about our...  encounter.

				CARL
		Maybe just you and me...  but this 
		is for a painting. I need a 
		pretty face.

	Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal 
	his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. 
	He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace 
	humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who 
	scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Sorry, I was out in the studio 
		doing some work and I forgot about 
		our appointment.

	He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away 
	-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him 
	and eyeing the expensive apartment.

				SIMON
		I usually make such a big deal out 
		of picking models but Carl's so 
		thorough. I'll bet he drove you 
		nuts checking your references.

	And he turns and sees the naked model.

				SIMON
			(taken aback)
		This isn't a nude.

	Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.

				VINCENT
		Just kidding around.
			(then mutters)
		So much for love.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)

	Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the 
	increasingly uneasy Simon.

				SIMON
		Exactly what is your previous 
		experience?

				VINCENT
		How about that pose?
			(sing-song)
		This is not fun... 
			(then)
		Give me some direction.

	Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He 
	tries not to show it.

				SIMON
		Nothing. I just watch till 
		something strikes me. Do anything 
		you think of -- try different 
		thing. Until I say, "hold that 
		pose." Then just try and 
		comfortably hold it.

				VINCENT
			(trying another space)
		The fact that you haven't said, 
		"hold it" means I haven't done it 
		right...  is that correct? I 
		haven't done it right?

				SIMON
		No...  Okay. What I do is watch 
		and wait for, um... You ever watch 
		someone who doesn't know you're 
		watching...  an old woman on a bus, 
		kids going to school and you see 
		this flash come over them and you 
		know immediately that it has 
		nothing to do with anything 
		external -- that it's in respond 
		to a private thought they just 
		had? They are just sort of realer 
		and more alive. And when you 
		notice it so are you. If you look 
		at someone long enough, you 
		discover their humanity.

	Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an 
	intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.

				VINCENT
		I know exactly what you mean.

	There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.

				SIMON
		Hold it.

	Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to 
	celebrate.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their 
	order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story 
	of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. 
	Carol is rapt.

	As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give 
	him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so 
	-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment 
	commentary on her every action.

				MELVIN
		Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- 
		she has to pretend she doesn't 
		hear me. Listening to the story 
		from the upset friend...  now she 
		drops off the cappuccino and 
		smiles at the putzette who doesn't 
		even say, "Thank you." No, the 
		putzette wanted the whipped cream 
		so back she goes and now she has 
		to pass him again and it's getting 
		tougher to make believe.

				CAROL
			(reluctant forgiveness)
		Okay.

	Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an 
	uncharacteristic rabbit punch.

				CAROL
		What's with the plastic picnic 
		ware? Why not try ours...  afraid 
		it isn't clean?

				MELVIN
		I see the help -- judgement call.

				CAROL
		Just give yourself a little pep 
		talk. "Must try other people's 
		clean silverware as part of the 
		fun of dining out."

				MELVIN
		What's wrong with your son, 
		anyway?

				CAROL
		What do you care?

	Melvin just looks at her.

				CAROL
		He's gotta fight to breathe. 
		His asthma can just shoot off the 
		charts -- he's allergic to dust 
		and this is New York and his 
		immune system bails on him when 
		there's trouble so an ear 
		infection...  Is this bothering 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(caught)
		No.

				CAROL
		An ear infection can send us to 
		the emergency room -- maybe five, 
		six times a month where I get 
		whatever nine-year-old they just 
		made a doctor. Nice chatting with 
		you.

				MELVIN
		His name?

				CAROL
		Spencer.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

				CAROL
			(quietly)
		Spence.

	She exits.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)

	The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts 
	the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat 
	and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and 
	the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.

				SIMON
		You can put on anything you want 
		now. I might be sort of done 
		here... 

	Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his 
	immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every 
	second of silence during the transition... then LOUD 
	MUSIC PLAYS...  Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon 
	does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down -- 
	which Vincent does.

	ANGLE - APARTMENT

	where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- 
	Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all 
	objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses 
	to look past the terrace to the studio.

				DOUG
		Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY

	MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.

				VINCENT
		So you're practically finished, 
		huh?

				SIMON
		Yes...  well, there's one more 
		stage -- trying to figure out if 
		it's any good.

	Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another 
	perspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod 
	of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate 
	to distract.

	CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his 
	ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to 
	frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

	As Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the 
	canvas.

				VINCENT
		Wait -- I want to see the 
		painting.

				SIMON
		Just a second -- he has to go.

				VINCENT
		Please!! NO!!!

	Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a 
	bullet. Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown 
	to see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized." 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL 
	stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.

	Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he 
	continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing 
	them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.

				SIMON
			(to Vincent)
		What's the matter, sweetheart?

	He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the 
	stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in. 
	Doug greets him.

				DOUG
		Yo.

	Simon turns to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Why are you doing this?

				VINCENT
		No. No. No. Hey, that painting 
		in there...  I just want to tell 
		you... 

	Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.

				EVAN
			(to Vincent)
		What are you doing? Cruising him?

	And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a 
	club, as the brief savage attack begins.

	ON VERDELL

	as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in 
	fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single 
	BARK from VERDELL.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK

	A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is 
	whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if 
	Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the 
	wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.

				RAY
		Okay. So you call 911 and don't 
		leave your name -- even a dumb 
		geezer should know that emergency 
		automatically pulls up your name. 
		How come you make a mistake like 
		that?

				MELVIN
		How come you're pretending to do 
		cop work -- 'cause I don't think 
		you could find your ass if you 
		were spotted the hole.

				RAY
			(stunned)
		What?

				MELVIN
		Just move on. No one here killed 
		him.

				RAY
		Oh, is he dead?

				MELVIN
		Ask him.

				RAY
		We will if we can and if we can't, 
		we'll come back and ask you again 
		and again.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - 
	ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

	Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a 
	leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic 
	little CRYING SOUNDS.

	As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...  Frank is talking to the 
	Sweet-Faced Woman.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I've been praying for him since I 
		heard.

				FRANK
		So I've got to get to the 
		hospital. If you could take the 
		dog just for tonight.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, Lord -- I've got all these 
		antique knick-knacks...  Or else 
		I'd be glad... 

				FRANK
		Maybe if you kept locked in 
		the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.
			(as he turns away and she 
			closes the door he adds)
		Old bitch...  Damn dog.

	A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed 
	and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings... 

	VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches 
	his mugger:

				FRANK
		You're taking him...  yes...  you're 
		taking him -- this will clear the 
		books. One night. You want to 
		say "no" to me? Try...  because 
		I've never felt as nuts as I do 
		right this second. I almost want 
		you to try saying "no."

				MELVIN
			(quietly)
		I'm not saying nothing to you.

				FRANK
		Thanks for looking after him.

	Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and 
	places Verdell inside.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to 
	block Verdell's escape.

	The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped 
	in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We 
	STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head 
	turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue 
	continues O.S.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Hey, where are you going? You 
		can't do this.
			(calls after Frank)
		I can't take a dog.
			(a confession)
		Nobody's ever been in here before.

				FRANK (O.S.)
			(threatening)
		You don't want to mess with me 
		today. I'll figure something else 
		out tomorrow.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now 
	Melvin sees him.

				MELVIN
		You're dead!!

	VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking 
	along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a 
	bit calming.

				MELVIN
		I don't have dog food. And I 
		won't want dog food here. You'll 
		eat what we have. You'll eat what 
		we eat.

	Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped 
	meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the 
	room.

				MELVIN
		Don't you touch anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC 
	CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and 
	exits...  Verdell breathes excitedly though looking 
	alternately in all directions... his recent past making 
	him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs 
	cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a 
	dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound 
	of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then 
	MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he 
	sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd. 
	Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl 
	with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and 
	sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of 
	Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks 
	over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts 
	and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out 
	the lights and exits.

	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

	Frank on the phone.

				FRANK
			(into phone)
		Put the solid red dots on three of 
		them and the hold blue dots on two 
		others...  Well, we're not going to 
		sell anything if they know we're 
		two weeks into a show and have no 
		sales. No, you can't reduce a 
		price at this stage...  We're in 
		free fall here. Any calls?

				JACKIE
		We can see him.

				FRANK
		I'll meet you in there.

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	As Jackie enters.

				JACKIE
		How you doing, great one?

				SIMON
		I haven't looked at myself yet. I 
		figured I could tell from your 
		reaction.

	He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his 
	painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a 
	horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into 
	yuccchhh...  The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into 
	tears...  sobs, actually.

				SIMON
		That bad, huh?

	They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in 
	the doorway.

				FRANK
		Hey, hey... 
			(as he sees him)
		Haaa...  bad but temporary. The 
		nurses say it's much better than 
		you looked three weeks ago...  the 
		hand will come back...  they're 
		sure... 

				SIMON
		Jackie, will you hand me the 
		mirror?

				JACKIE
			(a small voice)
		No.

	She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- 
	then thinks better of it.

				JACKIE
		Wait, I have a smaller one.

	But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror -- 
	he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.

				SIMON
		So, what's new anyway? How's 
		Verdell?

				FRANK
			(sheepish)
		Your neighbor -- Udall -- is 
		taking care of him.

				SIMON
			(suddenly alive and upset)
		How could you do that? He'll hurt 
		him.

				FRANK
		No, I promise...  not a chance. I 
		own this guy. There was no one 
		else. I'm on the move too much. 
		Trust me.

				SIMON
		You are very certain my dog is 
		okay...  because you have no 
		idea... 

				FRANK
		Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

	Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, 
	then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive 
	underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.

				SIMON
		Okay, waiting gives the devil 
		time. Now!

	He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror...  
	he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him 
	awed by his misfortune.

				SIMON
		Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?

	EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with 
	his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as 
	she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning 
	periodically to keep an eye of his dog.

				CAROL
		So what are you doing with a dog?

				MELVIN
		Suckered in. Set up. Pushed 
		around.

				CAROL
		You're not worried that someone 
		might take him?

				MELVIN
		Well, not until now -- for 
		Christ's sake.

				CAROL
		Sorry.

				MELVIN
		It's okay -- I'll sit here.

	He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can 
	keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.

				CAROL
		You know he's a little dog. Next 
		time, if Bryan's not here, you can 
		bring him in.

				MELVIN
		How old are you?

				CAROL
		Oh, please... 

				MELVIN
		If I had to guess by your eyes, 
		I'd say you were fifty.

	Carol looks at him.

				CAROL
		And if I had to guess by your 
		eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, 
		so much for eyes. But as long as 
		you bring up age...  how old are 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(quickly)
		Otherwise, you're not ugly.

				CAROL
			(laughs out loud)
		Okay, pal...  I accept the 
		compliment, but go easy -- my 
		knees start a-knocking when you 
		turn on the charm full blast.

				MELVIN
		What's with the dark?

	He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.

				CAROL
		Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. 
		My son had a full blown attack. 
		And this time, for extra fun, they 
		gave us the wrong antibiotics, so 
		I get him home... 

	She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes 
	nuts.

				MELVIN
		No...  no...  leave it...  the 
		bacon's for the dog.

	She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, 
	but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.

				MELVIN
		Last week I was playing the piano 
		for him and he likes it, and so I 
		decide I'm going to make a little 
		joke... 

				CAROL
		You all set here?

	Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to 
	finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a 
	beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is 
	avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.

				MELVIN
		It's a beautiful day for our walk.

	Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.

	ON VERDELL

	again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the 
	sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic 
	gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.

				MELVIN
		Don't be like me, don't you be 
		like me. You stay just the way 
		you are because you are a perfect 
		man. I'm gonna take you home and 
		get you something to eat...  what 
		you love.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				FEMALE PASSERSBY
			(charmed)
		Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like 
		that.

				MELVIN
			(all smiles to Verdell)
		Let's go home and do some writing.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself 
	with great satisfaction as he goes.

	Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his 
	master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing 
	aloud to the dog.

				MELVIN
		"He turned off the gas jets and 
		carried her outside. He kissed 
		her brow and when her eyes opened 
		and found him, he said, 'there are 
		easier ways to break a date.' She 
		laughed. The only sensible 
		ambition he had ever known was now 
		realized. He had made the girl 
		happy. And what a girl. 'You've 
		saved my life,' she said, 'you'd 
		better make it up to me.'"

	Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine... 

				MELVIN
			(singing to Verdell)
		Done!
			(playing with him some)
		Yes, I hate the doggy...  yes, I 
		hate the doggy.

	He exits.

				MELVIN (V.O.)
		Sixty-two books... done!

	As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our 
	couple's play time for... 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

	As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul 
	mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the 
	maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few 
	words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and 
	talk of how long Nora can stay on.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.

				FRANK
		How's Verdell doing?

				MELVIN
		He's a pain in the ass.

	As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, 
	without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's 
	surprise.

				FRANK
		Simon's home. I was sort of 
		hoping you could keep the dog 
		until he's had a chance to think 
		and adjust... 

				MELVIN
			(leaping at the chance)
		It's been five weeks...  another 
		few won't kill me.

				FRANK
		No. He wants him back. He'll be 
		by tomorrow.

				MELVIN
			(too loudly, weirdly)
		Okay by me.

	Frank exits.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to 
	the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are 
	locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in the 
	correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back to 
	check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished, 
	until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.

	INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

	Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a 
	wheelchair and shudders... 

				MELVIN
		That's some face they left hanging 
		on you. You look like... 

				SIMON
			(interrupting)
		Could you take it just a little 
		easy, Mr. Udall?

	A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.

				SIMON
		Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?
			(to Melvin)
		By the way, thanks for saving me.

				MELVIN
		I called. I never touched you. I 
		didn't leave my name or nothing.

				SIMON
			(not listening)
		Verdell?

	ON VERDELL

	Totally weirded out...  hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin 
	shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...  Simon 
	smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the 
	reunion.

				SIMON
		Hi, sweetheart.

	Verdell isn't eager.

	ON SIMON

	The first gnawing pains of rejection.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get 
	Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the 
	door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog 
	up.

				SIMON
		No. Please, don't force him.

				JACKIE
			(to dog)
		You little stinker. He's given 
		you everything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	MELVIN'S POV

	Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and 
	hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...  
	there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly 
	one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels 
	the panic rise in him... 

	...  all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and 
	now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.

				MELVIN
		Over the dog...  an ugly dog.

	It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual 
	sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite 
	pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but 
	highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared, 
	beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.

	EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

	Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then 
	turning into a building with a copper sign reading 
	"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."

				MELVIN
		Worst sidewalk in New York and 
		look where they put in.

	INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

	Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.

				MELVIN
		Help!

				DOCTOR
		If you want to see me you will not 
		do this. You will make an 
		appointment... 

				MELVIN
		Explain to me how you can diagnose 
		someone as "obsessive compulsive 
		disorder" and then act like I have 
		any choice in barging in.

				DOCTOR
		There's not going to be a debate. 
		You must leave.

	The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to 
	follow.

				MELVIN
		You said you could help me -- 
		what was that -- a tease?

				DOCTOR
		I can help you if you take the 
		responsibility to keep regular 
		app --

				MELVIN
			(suddenly)
		You changed the room around... 

				DOCTOR
		Two years ago... 

	Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough 
	he must go through a careful exercise noting every new 
	element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies 
	each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued 
	despite himself.

				DOCTOR
		I also regrew my beard...  but 
		you're not interested in changes 
		in me... so it's like I always 
		told you...  when it comes to 
		people you... 

				MELVIN
		Shhhhhhh. I don't have this 
		mountain of available time...  I 
		got to get to my restaurant on 
		time. Do you know how hard it is 
		for me to be here?

				DOCTOR
		Yes.
			(as Melvin starts 
			for the office)
		No.

	INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY

	More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin 
	passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops. 
	Eyes on them. Then:

				MELVIN
			(to other patients)
		What if this is as good as it 
		gets?

	They look stricken. He exits.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief. 
	CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his 
	table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils 
	and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT 
	AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl 
	looks at his utensils.

				CHERYL
		What the heck are those for?

				MELVIN
		No. No. Get Carol.

				CHERYL
		I'm filling in. We don't know if 
		she's coming back. She might have 
		to get a job closer to home.

				MELVIN
		What are you trying to do to me?

				CHERYL
		What the heck do you mean?

				MELVIN
		Hey, elephant girl, call her or 
		something...  just let her do my 
		one meal here. I'll pay whatever. 
		I'll wait.
			(as she doesn't 
			budge; he screams)
		Do it!!!

	The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police 
	that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.

				MANAGER
		Out. Be silent or leave.

				MELVIN
		I'll be quiet. Just let me wait. 
		No problem. Get her here -- have 
		her get me two sausages, four 
		bacon, two eggs over easy and 
		coffee. I'm not a prick here -- 
		I'm a great customer. This day is 
		a disaster. I can't handle this, 
		too.

				MANAGER
		Get out immediately or there's 
		going to be trouble.

	Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless 
	situation and rises.

				MELVIN
		There's going to be trouble???

	He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other 
	employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near 
	the door he hands him 20 dollars.

				MELVIN
		Carol's last name?

				BUSBOY
		Connelly.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

	An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.

	MELVIN'S POV

	A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever 
	the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of 
	community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving 
	their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local 
	store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.

	EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY

	Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. 
	She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a 
	thermometer.

				MELVIN
		I'm hungry.
			(on Carol's astonished 
			look)
		You've upset my whole day. I 
		haven't eaten.

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge 
	he had imagined she might make... 

				MELVIN
		This is not a sexist thing. If 
		you were a waiter I would still be 
		here saying... 

				CAROL
		Are you totally gone? This is my 
		private home... 

				MELVIN
		I am trying to keep emotions out of 
		this. Even though this is an 
		important issue to me and I have 
		strong feelings about the subject.

				CAROL
		What subject? That I wasn't there 
		to take crap from you and bring 
		you eggs? Do you have any control 
		over how creepy you allow yourself 
		to get?

				MELVIN
		Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... 
		and to prove it I have not gotten 
		personal and you have. Why aren't 
		you at work? You're not sick -- 
		you don't look sick... just very 
		tired and bitter.

				CAROL
		My son is sick, okay?

	Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some 
	emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy 
	man at her threshold.

				MELVIN
		What about your mother?

				CAROL
		How do you know about my mother?

				MELVIN
		I hear you talk when I'm 
		waiting!!!

	She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a 
	step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into 
	the room.

				CAROL
		Sorry, honey...  I'll be right 
		there.

				MELVIN
			(uncomfortably)
		How ya doing?

	Spencer just stares at him.

				MELVIN
			(miffed)
		You should answer when someone 
		talks to you... 

	Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then 
	emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs 
	out the door.

				CAROL
		Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, 
		and I can't handle you teaching 
		my son manners.

	She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son 
	and leads him back to his room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM

	CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of 
	Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his 
	ear. They both count down the seconds.

				CAROL AND SPENCER
		5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo.

				SPENCER
		104.9

				CAROL
		We are going to treat ourselves to 
		a cab ride.

	EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol carries her young son through a class of 
	uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She 
	spots Melvin about to enter a cab.

				CAROL
		Melvin, wait!

	The school kids pick up the chant in unison.

				SCHOOL KIDS
		Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! 
		Melvin, wait!

	He turns to face them.

				MELVIN
		Shut up, kids!

	They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.

				CAROL
		Melvin...  give us a lift. We've 
		got to go see our friends at the 
		hospital.

	Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the 
	rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The 
	maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

				MELVIN
		I'll ride up front. Cover your 
		mouth when you cough, kid.

	INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY

	As they settle in and drive off.

				CAROL
		Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, 
		please and quickly please.

	EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

	As Carol enters the hospital.

				CAROL
			(calling back)
		I owe you three dollars.

	Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son... 

				MELVIN
		Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll 
		get back to work today?

				CAROL
			(furiously)
		No!!! Stay away from me!

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for 
	Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...  
	she has some index cards in her laps which she 
	occasionally consults and shuffles.

				JACKIE
		I feel terrible that I have to... 
		Simon? Forget about the dog for a 
		second.

	Simon forces his attention to Jackie.

				SIMON
		Sorry. What are those cards?

				JACKIE
			(a bit embarrassed)
		Frank's idea. He thought I should 
		have notes so I did this right... 
		maintained focus, didn't get 
		emotional and tried not to terrify 
		you.

				SIMON
			(scared shitless)
		Terrify me?

				JACKIE
		See, he's right. I need the 
		cards.
			(reading from cards)
		Simon, you're broke.

	ANGLE ON VERDELL

	as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.

				JACKIE (O.S.)
		The medical bill are 61 thousand 
		now. I've spoken to your parents 
		and they didn't hang up or 
		anything -- they just said they 
		would feel strange calling you.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Well, I can't reach them.

	Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns 
	for:

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		Here, baby...  what is it, 
		Verdell?...  You miss the tough 
		guy... 
			(trying to be 
			Melvin-like)
		Well, here I am, you little pissant 
		mop, happy to see me? How about 
		another ride down the chute? Oh, 
		God...  I don't mean it, 
		sweetheart... 
			(on Jackie's look)
		I'm sorry. I know... 

	Verdell hides behind a chair.

				JACKIE
		Frank loves you. You know that... 
		but I've spoken to him and he 
		feels that --
			(reading from card)
		-- as a businessman, with limited 
		resources... 

				SIMON
		I'll be able to keep my apartment 
		and studio, won't I?...  Just tell 
		me.

	As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.

				SIMON
			(overwhelmed)
		Wow... 

	Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet 
	the dog and the dog ducks.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset. 
	He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He 
	is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.

	INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

	We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening 
	with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering 
	phone calls, "Premier Publishing."

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
		Yes, you write more than anyone 
		else. Yes, you make us a lot of 
		money, but isn't there someone 
		more appropriate to... 

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I need this. Just say, "Melvin, 
		I'll try," okay?

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
			(resigned)
		Melvin, I'll try.

	They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She 
	pauses at the elevator.

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE
		Now, on a pleasant note, our son 
		got accepted at Brown. My 
		husband... 

				MELVIN
			(curtly)
		Great, wonderful. I don't need 
		you to wait with me.

	She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe 
	summons her moxie.

				ZOE
		I can't resist. You usually move 
		through here so quickly and I have 
		so many questions I want to ask 
		you. You have no idea what your 
		work means to me.

				MELVIN
		What's it mean?

				ZOE
		That somebody out there knows what 
		it's like to be... 
			(taps her head and heart)
		in here.

				MELVIN
		Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

				ZOE
		Aw come on, just a couple of 
		questions -- how hard is that?

	As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button 
	etc.

				ZOE
		How do you write women so well?

				MELVIN
			(as he turns 
			toward her)
		I think of a man and take away 
		reason and accountability.

	The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.

	EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is 
	suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.

	CAROL'S POV

	A car at the curb with "MD" license plate.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As Carol breaks into a run.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY

	As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and 
	jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering 
	sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment.

				CAROL
		Hello? Hello?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.

	The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, 
	her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk 
	on opening day of the hunting season.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY

				CAROL
		What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

				DR. BETTES
		Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes
		...  Dr. Bettes.

				CAROL
		Not your name...  what are you 
		telling me your name for!! Where 
		is he?

				DR. BETTES
		He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.

				CAROL
			(overlapping)
		Tell me how bad it is. I let him 
		go out last night when it was so 
		cool without an overshirt -- just 
		and underone with just the straps 
		and I know better...  and I let him 
		talk me into it. He was whining 
		and...  you don't need this. Give 
		me a second to catch hold.

	And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some 
	notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it 
	takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and 
	she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer 
	enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now. 
	Salvation as farce.

				SPENCER
			(to his mother)
		Hi... 
			(they kiss)
		Did you know there are doctors who 
		come to your house?

				CAROL
		No, I didn't.
			(to Bettes)
		So why are you h... 

	Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient 
	which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

				BEVERLY
		I didn't know you had a secret 
		admire.

				CAROL
		Huh?

				BEVERLY
		You met the gift.

				SPENCER
		He's good...  And I'm an expert on 
		doctors.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		Stay out of this...  Doctor?

				DR. BETTES
		My wife is Melvin Udall's 
		publisher.
			(as Carol reacts)
		She says I have to take great care 
		of this guy because you're 
		urgently needed back at work. 
		What work do you do?

				CAROL
		I'm a waitress.

	ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.

				BEVERLY
		In Manhattan.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Dr. Bettes?

				DR. BETTES
		In here.

	A NURSE enters.

				NURSE
		Sorry it took so long. I don't 
		know Brooklyn.

				DR. BETTES
		It's okay, Terry.
			(hands her blood 
			vail)
		Tell the lab I'd like the report 
		back today.

	Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.

				CAROL
		You're going to get the results 
		today?!

	MOVING SHOT

	As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from 
	each other at a small table... soft voices...  relaxation. 
	Bettes is examining medicine bottles.

				DR. BETTES
		How long has he been having 
		problems?

				CAROL
		Since forever.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done blood tests on him?

				CAROL
		Yes.

				DR. BETTES
		Only in the emergency room or when 
		he was well.

				CAROL
		Emergency room only.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done skin testing for 
		allergies?

				CAROL
		No.

				DR. BETTES
		They haven't done the standard 
		scratch test. Where they make 
		small injections into the skin?

				CAROL
		No. I asked. They said it's not 
		covered under my plan. And it's 
		not necessary anyway.

				DR. BETTES
		It's amazing these things weren't 
		done.

				CAROL
		Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of 
		shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.

				DR. BETTES
		No. Actually, I think that's 
		their technical name.

				CAROL
		Once the tests come back, is there 
		someone I can reach in your office 
		for the results?

				DR. BETTES
		Me. My home number is on this 
		card.

				CAROL
		His home number.

	Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly 
	has a hard time stopping.

				CAROL
			(to doctor)
		Do you want some juice or coffee 
		or two female slaves?

				DR. BETTES
		Water...  Nobody told you it might 
		be a good idea to remove the 
		carpeting and drapes in Spencer's 
		room?

				CAROL
		No.

	She starts towards Spencer's room.

				DR. BETTES
		You don't have to do it this 
		second...  it's not dangerous or 
		anything. It's just something 
		that's advisable. Look, there's 
		a lot to be checked but...  Hey, 
		your son is going to feel a 
		good deal better at the very 
		least... 

	She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce 
	intimacy.

				CAROL
		Doc!!!
			(then)
		So listen, you gotta let me know 
		about the additional costs -- one 
		way or the other we'll... 

				DR. BETTES
		They're considerable. But Mr. 
		Udall wants to be billed.

	She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained 
	Nora hugs him good-bye.

				NORA
		You poor, poor man.

				SIMON
		Let's use just one poor, okay? 
		Anyway, dear, thanks for 
		everything. Forgive my recent 
		crankiness and as soon as things 
		are on track again I'll call.

	She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a 
	sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				NORA
		Who's going to walk Verdell?

	Simon hadn't thought of this either.

				SIMON
		No, no.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY

	Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin 
	opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.

				MELVIN
		Is he dead yet?

				NORA
		No! Would there be any way for 
		you to be willing to walk his dog 
		for him?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely.

				NORA
		Not just today -- Uh, could you 
		do it -- until, until he gets 
		back on his feet?

				MELVIN
		Sure thing.

				NORA
		You're a wonderful man. Two 
		o'clock is a good time. Here's 
		the key in case he's asleep. Open 
		the curtains for him, so he sees 
		God's beautiful work and knows 
		that even things like this happen 
		for the best.

				MELVIN
		Where'd they teach you to talk 
		like this -- some Panama City 
		"Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? 
		Or was today getaway day and your 
		last shot at his whiskey. Sell 
		crazy some place else -- we're all 
		stocked up here.

	He closes the door in her face. She stands there... 
	thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper 
	shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the 
	elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then 
	continues on her way.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT

	The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.

				CAROL
		There is a seriously goofy man 
		behind this. You are not allowed 
		to block out that fact.

				BEVERLY
		Do you really want to go back to 
		the runt doctors in Emergency who 
		keep telling us they can't help?

				CAROL
		It lets a crazy man into our 
		lives.

				BEVERLY
		Come on. Why fight when we know 
		how it will come out. This isn't 
		like stocking or a string of 
		pearls. You don't send this one 
		back.

	EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS. 
	He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that 
	reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult 
	struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he 
	answers.

				SIMON
		Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally, 
		huh? Why, "finally"? Because I 
		called you so many times. Maybe 
		20.
			(relief)
		Oh, boy...  I was hoping it was 
		something like that. You didn't 
		get one of them, huh? 'Cause I 
		mean it wasn't only your office -- 
		it was your home, hotel and the 
		cigar club you like in San 
		Francisco. No -- Sarcastic...  Of 
		course. I believe you. No, don't 
		fire anyone...  Please. Maybe I'm 
		wrong about the 20 times. Take a 
		breath... 
			(more)
		So, you miss me a little? Hey, 
		strike the question -- How's the 
		case going? Really. Fantastic. 
		I didn't hear. I haven't been 
		watching. Great. Just great. 
		I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me? 
		Well, I'm mending. No, I look 
		fine. Well, some of the damage 
		might still be noticeable if you 
		look closely... 

	He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and 
	beaten face... 

				SIMON
		Carl, I need some help and you're 
		the logical one to turn to.
			(aghast)
		No! Not 'cause I blame you for 
		what happened. I hardly get how 
		you can ever think that. No, I'm 
		not being sarcastic.
			(trying to figure it 
			out)
		I guess because you hired the guy 
		who did this you think...  No, I am 
		a sarcastic person. Well, if 
		you must know, the reason I said 
		you were the logical person is 
		because you always told me how you 
		thought I was this great person 
		who made you feel good about 
		humanity and everything. You do 
		remembering saying that? Well, whew. 
		Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but 
		this money thing is ridiculously 
		serious... 

	He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes 
	the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

				SIMON
		"Will you please loan me money? I 
		will pay you back. I will give 
		you whatever percentage of my 
		income I don't absolutely need 
		until I do. It will take a while. 
		But I don't know what I'll do if 
		you say"... that.
			(as he listens)
		I understand...  yes...  No, I do.
			(a bit of boldness)
		But you know, you know -- you 
		didn't even ask how much, Carl? 
		Well, Frank has no right to 
		discuss how much I'm in hock... 
		no, you're right -- not the point. 
		So...  what have you been up to??? 
		Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...  
		how was it? Well, I'm not 
		surprised that there's that much 
		talent around...  great...  Look -- 
		gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel 
		that way at all...  take care, you, 
		too...  you, too...  Good-bye.
			(as he hangs up)
		Pal o' mine.

	It's very quiet.

	LONG SHOT - SIMON

	A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his 
	face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional 
	release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous 
	with the moment of catharsis... 

	...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the 
	CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to 
	focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering 
	the room.

				MELVIN
		Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

				SIMON
		Thank you for walking him.

	Simon wheels away from Melvin.

				SIMON
		If you'll excuse me I'm not 
		feeling so well.

				MELVIN
		It smells like shit in here?

				SIMON
		Go away.

				MELVIN
		That cleaning woman doesn't... 

				SIMON
		Please, just leave.

				MELVIN
		Where are all your queer party 
		friends?

				SIMON
			(his first shout)
		Get out.

	Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon 
	with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?

				SIMON
		Nothing worse than having to feel 
		this way in front of you?

				MELVIN
		Nellie, you're a disgrace to 
		depression.

				SIMON
		Rot in hell, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		No need to stop being a lady... 
		quit worrying -- you'll be back on 
		your knees in no time.

	Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden 
	attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.

				SIMON
		Is this fun for you? Well, you 
		lucky devil...  It just gets better 
		and better. I am losing my 
		apartment and Frank wants me to 
		promise to paint hotter subjects 
		and to beg my parents, who haven't 
		called, for help... and I won't. 
		And I don't want to paint anymore.

	Melvin has made for the door...  Simon blocks him.

				SIMON
		So the life I was trying for is 
		over. The life I had is gone and 
		I am feeling so damn sorry for 
		myself that it is difficult to 
		breathe. Right times for you -- 
		huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is 
		terrified... 
			(a sudden screamed 
			word surprises them 
			both)
		Terrified...  Lucky you, you're 
		here for rock bottom...  me 
		wallowing in self-pity in front of 
		you, you absolute horror of a 
		human being... 

	As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with 
	discomfort.

				MELVIN
		Well, I'll do one thing for you 
		that might cheer you up.

				SIMON
		Get out.

				MELVIN
		Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. 
		You want to know why the dog 
		prefers me...  it's not affection. 
		It's a trick.

	Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's 
	rapt...  Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.

				MELVIN
		I carry bacon in my pocket.

				SIMON
			(pleased)
		Oh, my gosh.

				MELVIN
			(hands him bacon)
		Now we'll both call him.

				SIMON
		Come on, sweetheart... 

				MELVIN
		Yo, yo, yo... 

	Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally 
	surprised and staggered by the implications. True love 
	and such.

				SIMON
		Would you leave now, please?

				MELVIN
		Stupid dog.
			(to Simon)
		I don't get it.

	He exits...  looking apologetically at Simon in stoic 
	ruin.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Carol in bed on the pullout sofa...  She is in turmoil... 
	there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen. 
	She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.

	INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol 
	shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep.

	Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving 
	her nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy 
	here, the woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer 
	dress -- no time for underwear.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

	Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.

	EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM

	Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on 
	her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the 
	subject.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING - 
	NIGHT (RAIN)

	Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the 
	rains come...  We are in a familiar neighborhood.

	ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE

	As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on 
	it.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)

	As she enters building and realizes it's not just that 
	she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet 
	T-shirt contest...  the fabric clinging to her breasts, 
	like the old movie poster of The Deep.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of 
	Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness 
	and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally 
	Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side 
	of the door.

				CAROL
		Uh, Udall?

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Carol the waitress?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her 
	breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it 
	straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is 
	static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it 
	self-conscious pats.

				CAROL
		The doctors had your billing 
		address. I'm sorry about the 
		hour.

				MELVIN
		I was working...  can't you just 
		drop me a thank-you note?

				CAROL
		That's not why I'm here... 
			(tearing suddenly)
		...  though you have no idea what 
		it's like to have a real 
		conversation with a doctor about 
		Spencer... 

				MELVIN
			(very uncomfortable)
		Note. Put it in the note.

				CAROL
		Why did yo do this for me?

				MELVIN
		To get you back at work so you can 
		wait on me.

				CAROL
		But you do have some idea how 
		strange that sounds??? I'm 
		worried that you did this 
		because... 

	She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long 
	silence. Finally.

				MELVIN
		You waiting for me to say 
		something?
			(as she shakes her head)
		What sort of thing do you want? 
		Look, I'll be at the restaurant 
		tomorrow.

				CAROL
		I don't think I can wait until 
		tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

				MELVIN
		What needs clearing up?

				CAROL
			(strong and true)
		I'm not going to sleep with you. 
		I will never, ever sleep with you. 
		Never. Not ever.

	Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the 
	brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to 
	scream --

	-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt 
	during his half turn away from her -- and then answer 
	hoarsely.

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry. We don't open for the 
		no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

	Carol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way 
	ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity.

				CAROL
		I'm not kidding.

				MELVIN
		Okay!!!! Anything else?!?

				CAROL
		Just how grateful I am.

	Her mission completed -- she turns.

				MELVIN
		So you'll be at work?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's 
	night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we've 
	seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor 
	twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his 
	body angles from the bed in a deliberate way.

	He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays 
	very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his 
	forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the light 
	on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator... 

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR - 
	NIGHT

	As he grabs a cardboard take-out box... 

	INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.
	
	He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly.

	SIMON'S APARTMENT

				MELVIN
		I took a chance you were up.

	Simon walks painfully back to a chair.

				MELVIN
		I brought you Chinese soup.

				SIMON
		Thanks.

				MELVIN
		I have never been so tired in my 
		life. Okay, if I sit here?

				SIMON
		Got any easier questions?

	Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.

				MELVIN
		I haven't been sleeping. I 
		haven't been clear or felt like 
		myself. I'm in trouble. Some son 
		of a bitch is burning my bridges 
		behind my back...  But the 
		tiredness -- boy...  Not just 
		sleepy.

				SIMON
		But sick -- nauseous -- where 
		everything looks distorted and 
		everything inside just aches -- 
		when you can barely get up the 
		will to complain.

				MELVIN
			(brightening)
		Yeah... 

	He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to 
	take it from here.

				MELVIN
		I'm glad we did this.

	He rises and makes an awkward exit.

				MELVIN
		Good talking to you.

	He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to 
	express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed 
	pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't 
	even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and 
	is let in by Beverly.

	They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly 
	hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over 
	Carol's shoulder -- "I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and 
	emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my 
	conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how 
	gratefull (sic)... "

				BEVERLY
		You're not still writing that 
		thank-you note?

				CAROL
		I'm on the last page. How do you 
		spell conscience?

				BEVERLY
		C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean 
		from the bakery to baby-sit so 
		let's go out.

				CAROL
		I still don't feel safe leaving 
		Spencer with someone. How do you 
		spell it again?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer is okay. You'd better 
		start finding something else to do 
		with your free time. If you can't 
		feel good about this break and 
		step out a little... 
			(struts and pumps 
			her arms)
		You ought to get Mr. Udall to send 
		you over a psychiatrist.

				CAROL
			(more emotionally 
			than she intended)
		I don't need one 'cause I know 
		what's really going on here. I 
		have to finish this letter or 
		I'll go nuts.
			(looking at paper; 
			weepy)
		This can't be right -- con-
		science.

	Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself 
	on the brink of crying.

				BEVERLY
		Carol. What?

	Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able 
	to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she 
	looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission 
	for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol 
	-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

				CAROL
		I don't know... It's very strange 
		not feeling that stupid panic 
		thing inside you all the time. 
		Without that you just start 
		thinking about yourself -- and 
		what does that ever get anybody. 
		Today, on the bus there was this 
		adorable couple and I felt myself 
		giving them a dirty look -- I had 
		no idea everything was... 

				BEVERLY
		Go ahead.

				CAROL
			(great, forceful 
			hand gestures)
		... moving in the wrong 
		direction... Away from when I 
		even remembered what it was like 
		to have a man to... anything... 
		hold fucking -- sorry -- hands 
		with, for Christ's sake. I was 
		feeling like really bad that Dr. 
		Bettes is married.
			(this next one's 
			tough)
		Which is probably why I make poor 
		Spencer hug me more than he wants 
		to... Like the poor kid doesn't 
		have enough problems. He has to 
		make up for his mom not getting 
		any.
			(weeps at her 
			insight)
		Oh, boy. Who needs these 
		thoughts?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer's doing fine. So what are 
		you saying, that you're frustr... 

				CAROL
		Leave me be! Why are you doing 
		this? Why are you picking at my 
		sores... What is it that you 
		want?... You want what? What's 
		with you? I hope getting me 
		thinking of everything that's 
		wrong when all I want is to not 
		do this has some purpose.
			(puffy; red; 
			furious)
		What is it, Mom? No kidding.

	Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked 
	husky voiced question.

				CAROL
		What is it you want? What?

				BEVERLY
		I want us to go out.

	A beat, then.

				CAROL
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their 
	cry.

				CAROL
			(to Sean)
		We're going out.

				SEAN
			(looking at their 
			red eyes)
		Looks like fun.

	She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what 
	he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting.

				CAROL
		Okay -- we're out of here. I love 
		you.

	Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol 
	as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. 
	Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, 
	going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then 
	to her son to ask:

				CAROL
		Do you love me?

				SPENCER
		Uh-huh.

	Carol exits.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY

	Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A 
	simple and unprecedented experience in their recent 
	lives.

				BEVERLY
		Nice to get out, isn't it?

	Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each 
	other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 
	14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated 
	at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa 
	keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.

				CAROL
		Don't get it wet.

	Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.

				CAROL
		So it's okay?

				LISA
		You almost have me liking him. 
		You sure come from the heart. I 
		never knew what you went through 
		with everything.

				CAROL
		I wanted him to know how much he'd 
		done.
			(looking over)
		Can you believe he's eating with 
		someone.

	ON MELVIN & FRANK

				MELVIN
		It's not my dog and this Simon 
		seems to have enough on his mind 
		-- but he did throw up twice and 
		his spark is off.

				FRANK
		Sure -- take him to the vet.

				MELVIN
		I did. And his stomach is out of 
		whack. So they need him for a 
		couple of days.

				FRANK
		Do it.

				CAROL
		Melvin.

	She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.

				MELVIN
		What's this?

				CAROL
			(sotto)
		A thank-you note for what you did 
		for me.

	He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and 
	walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, 
	confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note.

	After Carol leaves... 

				FRANK
		She's nice.

				MELVIN
			(to Frank)
		Really nice. Shouldn't that be a 
		good thing... telling someone, 
		'no thanks required.'

				FRANK
		It looks like it really went over. 
		You're sure making the rounds. 
		Simon says you brought him soup 
		last night. I hope he doesn't 
		write you a note.

	Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing 
	message.

				FRANK
		What?

				MELVIN
		"What?" Look at you... You sense 
		a mark.

				FRANK
		Hey -- you called me... I... 

				MELVIN
		About a dog.

				FRANK
		Yeah, but it's all about Simon 
		now... you helped with the dog... 
		And now there are other things. 
		I'm just as concerned as you are 
		about Simon.

				MELVIN
		Concerned. I'm just the hall 
		monitor here.

				FRANK
		It's not only financial 
		assistance. What he's got to do 
		is go to Baltimore tomorrow and 
		ask his parents for money. It's 
		not going to happen on the phone.

				MELVIN
		Yeah. If his parents are alive 
		they've got to help -- those are 
		the rules. Good.

				FRANK
		Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high 
		maintenance selling painter coming 
		through... So I'm out. Can you 
		take him?

				MELVIN
		Think white and get serious.

	Carol enters scene.

				FRANK
		Take my car -- a convertible. Do 
		you drive?

				MELVIN
			(loudly)
		Like the wind but I'm not doing 
		it.

				CAROL
		Getting loud, getting loud.

				MELVIN
		He wants me to take his car and 
		his client to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		I want your life for a minute 
		where my big problem is someone 
		offers me a free convertible so I 
		can get out of this city.

	She exits. Frank prepares to depart.

				MELVIN
		Okay. I'll take him. Get him 
		packed -- ready -- tomorrow 
		morning.

	Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.

				MELVIN
			(excited)
		Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. 
		Let's not drag this out. We don't 
		enjoy another that much.

				FRANK
		If there's some mental health 
		foundation that raises money to 
		help people like you be sure to 
		let me know.

				MELVIN
		Last word freak.

	Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a 
	"good-bye" to him.

				CAROL
		So. Anything else?

				MELVIN
		Yes. I'm going to give my queer 
		neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		Okay.

				MELVIN
		Hey, what I did for you is working 
		out?

				CAROL
			(a breath; then)
		What you did changed my life.

	She offers him the note.

				MELVIN
		No... no thank you notes.

				CAROL
		Well, part of what I said in this 
		entire history of my life which 
		you won't read is that somehow 
		you've done more for my mother, my 
		son and me, than anyone else ever 
		has... And that makes you the most 
		important, surprising, generous 
		person I've ever met and that you 
		be in our daily prayers forever.

				MELVIN
		Lovely.

				CAROL
		I also wrote one part... I wrote 
		I'm sorry... I was talking about I 
		was sorry when I got mad at you 
		when you came over and you told my 
		son that he ought to answer back 
		so I wrote that.
			(reading from the 
			letter, Melvin 
			wildly uncomfortable)
		I was sorry for busting you on 
		that... and I'm sorry for busting 
		in on you that night... when I 
		said I was never... I was sorry 
		and I'm sorry every time your food 
		was cold and that you had to wait 
		two seconds for a coffee filler... 

	Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- 
	emotionally moved by her own words.

				CAROL
		... and I'm sorry for never 
		spotting, right there at the table 
		in the restaurant, the human being 
		that had it in him to do this 
		thing for us... You know what, I'm 
		just going to start from the 
		beginning... I have not been able 
		to express my gratefulness to 
		you... even as I look at the word 
		"grateful" now it doesn't begin to 
		tell you what I feel for you... 

	And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.

				MELVIN
		Nice of you... thank you.

				CAROL
		Thank you.

				MELVIN
		Now I want you to do something for me.

	She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.

				CAROL
		Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, 
		"what?" I thought I said, 
		"what?"... What?

				MELVIN
		I want you to go on this trip.

				CAROL
		No, sir... 

				MELVIN
		I can't do this alone. I'm afraid 
		he'll pull the stiff one eye on 
		me. I need you to chaperon. 
		Separate everything but cars. You 
		said you liked convertibles. Now 
		I'm on the hook.

				CAROL
		The stiff one eye?

				MELVIN
		Two days.

				CAROL
		I can't. I work.

				MELVIN
		You take off when you have to.

				CAROL
		My son.

				MELVIN
		Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

				CAROL
			(no other way)
		Melvin, I'd rather not.

				MELVIN
		What's that got to do with it?

				CAROL
		Funny, I thought it was a strong 
		point.

				MELVIN
		Write me a note and ain't she 
		sweet. I need a hand and where'd 
		she go.

				CAROL
		Are you saying accepting your help 
		obligates me!?

				MELVIN
		Is there another way to see it?

				CAROL
		No.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf 
	of the closet.

				CAROL
		Well, here's a little suitcase 
		shocked that it's been used.

	She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's 
	too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another 
	drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries 
	of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

	INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER

	Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday 
	"girl Jockies." She fingers the good stuff -- puts it 
	back -- then the everyday -- hesitates.

				CAROL
			(furiously exasperated)
		There's not way to pack for this 
		trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm 
		not packing the camera.

	As she exits the room --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	As she picks up the phone.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly 
	stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a 
	camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items -- 
	underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each 
	one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds 
	another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing 
	development. He has almost no recent experience with 
	receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little 
	comment to himself as he moves.

				MELVIN
		Woo-woo.

	He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is 
	-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but 
	before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his 
	throat.

	ON CAROL

	As she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a 
	pretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)

				CAROL
		Hello?

				MELVIN
		Are you still coming?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	Melvin visibly relaxes.

				CAROL
		Melvin... I'd like to know exactly 
		where we are going.

				MELVIN
		Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. 
		So I know what you're going to ask 
		next.
			(correcting himself)
		That you might ask -- I'm not 
		certain.

				CAROL
		There's... there's no need to 
		bring anything dressy... or... I 
		mean -- I didn't know if we'd be 
		eating at any restaurant that 
		have dress codes.

				MELVIN
		Oh.
			(a beat)
		We might. Yes. We can. Let's.

				CAROL
		Okay, gotcha. What did you think 
		I was going to ask?

				MELVIN
		Whether crabs are in season there 
		now... 

				CAROL
		Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good 
		night.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

				BEVERLY
		How was it talking to him?

				CAROL
		Stop treating this like I'm going 
		away with a man. He's just going 
		to say those crappy, sick, 
		complaining, angry things to me. 
		I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. 
		He's a freak show -- the worst 
		person I ever met.

				BEVERLY
		Well, maybe he has nice friends.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches. 
	She kisses them.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		You stand there and I'll wave to 
		you from the back window.

	As she boards the bus.

				BEVERLY
		Call me as soon as you're settled.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		I love you.

	The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them 
	open.

				CAROL
			(to bus driver)
		Sensitive, huh?!

	The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at 
	his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing 
	himself.

	INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

	A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as 
	Melvin finishes filling out some forms.

	On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black 
	dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

				VETERINARIAN
		Anything unusual in the dog's 
		diet?

				MELVIN
		No. Everybody gets their own 
		cage?

				VETERINARIAN
		Certainly.

				MELVIN
			(pointing to 
			Chihuahua)
		Put him in with that one, not that 
		one... 
			(pointing to large 
			dog)
		... Builds his confidence.

	EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	Carol disembarks.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	As she walks and turns a corner.

	CLOSE ON CAROL

	The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death 
	chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do 
	not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws" 
	will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect 
	couldn't be grimmer.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the 
	tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the 
	building.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry that I'm not taking 
		you.

				SIMON
			(upset)
		So am I, Frank.

	Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

				MELVIN
		Soak it up -- it's your last 
		chance at a hug for a few days.

	As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor 
	changes... that quickly there is a shyness.

				CAROL
		Hi.

				MELVIN
		Thanks for being on time... Carol, 
		the waitress, this is Simon, the 
		fag.

				CAROL
		Hello... Oh, my God, who did that 
		to you?

				SIMON
		I, uh... I was... attacked. 
		Walked in on people robbing me. I 
		was hospitalized. I almost died.

				MELVIN
		Let's do the small talk in the 
		car. Load up.

	Carol puts her bag in the car.

				MELVIN
		I was going to do that for you.

				CAROL
			(taken aback)
		It's okay. No problem. Where 
		should we sit?

				MELVIN
			(totally non-plussed)
		I -- uh, I... Well, there is no 
		place cards or anything.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me go in back. You look like 
		you need all the room you can 
		manage.

				SIMON
		That's very thoughtful.

				MELVIN
		Never a break. Never.

	Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's 
	not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small 
	back seat. She struggles to get her feet in. 

				MELVIN
		You're really jammed back there.

	He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his 
	seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving 
	Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel. 
	She is startled by the gesture.

				CAROL
		Thanks, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		Welcome.

	And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

	EXT. 12TH STREET

	Turning onto Fifth.

				MELVIN
		I got the whole ride programmed.

	CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all 
	carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the 
	one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly 
	and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick 
	burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

				MELVIN
		Just wanted to see what you'd do. 
		No, we have greatness here.

	He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS 
	UP."

	The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY 
	SELECTED MUSIC.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		Hey, I like this music.

	And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	The three of them... Carol chattering away.

				CAROL
		I don't know the last time I've 
		been out of the city... Hey, my 
		arms are tanning. I used to tan 
		great. We gotta stop soon so'se 
		I can check on Spencer.

				SIMON
			(during the above)
		I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I 
		can't turn my head all the way 
		yet... tell her we can't hear her.

				MELVIN
		Doesn't matter. She's enjoying 
		herself. Consider it part of the 
		music.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	A short time later. Carol is now driving.

				CAROL
		I'm sure, Simon, they did 
		something real off for you to feel 
		this way... But when it comes to 
		your partners -- or your kid -- 
		things will always be off for you 
		unless you set it straight. Maybe 
		this thing happened to you just to 
		give you that chance.

				MELVIN
		Nonsense!

				CAROL
		Anybody here who's interested in 
		what Melvin has to say raise their 
		hands.

	Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus 
	declared their majority.

				SIMON
		Do you want to know what happened 
		with my parents?

				CAROL
		Yes. I really would.

				SIMON
		Well... 

				CAROL
		No, let me pull over so I can pay 
		full attention.

	Car pulling over toward parking spot.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY

	She takes the car curbside and parks.

				CAROL
		Now go ahead.

	Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks 
	innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something 
	-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

				SIMON
		Well, I always painted. Always. 
		And my mother always encouraged 
		it. She was sort of fabulous 
		about it actually... and she used 
		to... I was too young to think 
		there was anything at all wrong 
		with it... and she was very 
		natural. She used to pose nude 
		for me... and I thought or assumed 
		my father was aware of it.

				MELVIN
		This stuff is pointless.

				CAROL
		Hey -- you let him... 

				MELVIN
		You like sad stories -- you want 
		mine.

				CARL
		. Go ahead, Simon. Really. 
		Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

				SIMON
		Okay. Well, one day my father 
		came in on one of those painting 
		sessions when I was nine -- and he 
		just started screaming at her -- 
		at us -- at evil. And... 

				MELVIN
			(very quickly)
		... my father didn't leave his 
		room for 11 years -- he hit my 
		hand with a yardstick if I made a 
		mistake on the piano.

				CAROL
		Go ahead, Simon. Your father 
		walked in on you and was yelling 
		and... really, come on.

				SIMON
		I was trying to defend my mother 
		and make peace, in the lamest way. 
		I said, "she's not naked -- it's 
		art." And then he started hitting 
		me. And he beat me unconscious. 
		After that he talked to me less 
		and less -- he knew before I left 
		for college, my dad came into my 
		room. He held out his hand. It 
		was filled with money. A big wad 
		of sweaty money.
			(gathers himself)
		And he said to me, "I don't want 
		you to ever come back." I grabbed 
		him and I hugged him... He turns 
		and walked out.

	Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as 
	strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so 
	much more complicated than her meat and potatoes 
	troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her 
	fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, 
	understated, gesture of friendship.

				CAROL
		Well, you know -- I still stay 
		what I said. You've got to get 
		past it all when it comes to your 
		parents. We all have these horror 
		stories to get over.

	Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

				MELVIN
		That's not true. Some of us have 
		great stories... pretty stories 
		that take place at lakes with 
		boats and friends and noodle 
		salad. Just not anybody in this 
		car. But lots of people -- that's 
		their story -- good times and 
		noodle salad... and that's what 
		makes it hard. Not that you had 
		it bad but being that pissed that 
		so many had it good.

				CAROL
		No.

				SIMON
		Not it at all, really.

				MELVIN
			(a veteran's irony)
		Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to 
		the hotel. And if you're lucky 
		tomorrow Dad will give you another 
		wad of sweaty money.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY

				MELVIN
		Two bedrooms and the sofa opens... 

	Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		No answer... Maybe we should just 
		drive there tomorrow. Can I have 
		that one?

				MELVIN
		Yes... sure.
			(to Simon)
		I'll take the sofa.

	Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever 
	have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials... 

				CAROL
			(into phone)
		Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are 
		you out of breath? You did?!? 
		That is great... So great... So -- 
		no, wait a second, Spence... 

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially 
	neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.

				MELVIN
		Can I ask you a personal question?

	Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

				MELVIN
		Do you ever get an erection for a 
		woman?

				SIMON
		Melvin... 

				MELVIN
		Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier 
		if you were not... 

				SIMON
		You consider your life easy.

				MELVIN
		I give you that one... 
			(eyes suitcase)
		Nice packing.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting 
	there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new 
	factors in her life.

				CAROL
		My son was outside playing soccer. 
		I never saw him playing ball. Come 
		on, you guys -- take me out for a 
		good time... Take me out dancing.

				MELVIN
		Dancing?

				SIMON
		I can't, I'm exhausted.

	Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is 
	visibly disturbed by her gesture.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		I don't blame you... This is a 
		monumental first day out... You 
		sad or anything?

				SIMON
		No... Nervous. It would be very 
		rough, Carol, if you weren't 
		along.

				CAROL
		What a nice compliment.

	She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy. 
	She turns to him.

				CAROL
		I'm happy. And you're my date. 
		Let's get dressed.

	She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

				MELVIN
		I'm going to jump in the shower. 
		I'll be right with you.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main 
	room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she 
	sits down to wait -- through... 

	SERIES OF DISSOLVES

	Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until 
	finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom 
	through a cloud of steam. They exit.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they drive up.

				VALET
		Good evening, sir.

				MELVIN
		They sell hard shell crabs here?

				VALET
		Yes.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they enters... 

				HEAD WAITER
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		Hi. You have hard shells, right?

				CAROL
		Stop asking everyone.

				MELVIN
		Just him and that's it. Okay, you 
		can answer -- we've worked it out.

				HEAD WAITER
		Yes, we do... And I can give you a 
		tie and jacket.

				MELVIN
		What?

				HEAD WAITER
		They require a tie and jacket but 
		we have some available.

	He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.

				MELVIN
		No... I'm not wearing that -- and 
		just in case you were going to ask 
		I'm not going to let you inject me 
		with plaque either.

				CAROL
		You promised a nice place -- can't 
		you just... 
			(to Head Waiter)
		You have these dry cleaned all the 
		time, don't you?

				HEAD WAITER
		Actually, I don't think so.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Wait here.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.

	EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

	As the car goes right across the street to a shopping 
	mall.

	INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT

	Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.

				SALESMAN
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		I need a coat and tie.

	OTHER ANGLE

	CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so 
	that passage for Melvin is impossible.

				SALESMAN
		Come on in.

				MELVIN
		No.

				SALESMAN
		No?

				MELVIN
			(pointing)
		That jacket and give me a tie.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.

				VALET #2
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		You have hard shells?

				VALET #2
		I'm not sure.

				MELVIN
		Everyone else says you do.

				VALET #2
		Then I guess we do.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT

	As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is 
	having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool -- 
	watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning 
	down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin 
	watches... Watches his date.

				HEAD WAITER
		Shall I get her for you?

				MELVIN
		No, it's all right. I'll just 
		watch.

	He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns 
	-- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture... 
	and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has 
	lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her. 
	She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, 
	giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g. 
	She notices the waiter in her trail.

				CAROL
			(mouthing the words 
			to Melvin)
		My drink is following me.

	Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite. 
	He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.

				CAROL
		You look s... 

	She stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then... 

				CAROL
		You look great.

	They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.

				CAROL
		You wanna dance?

				MELVIN
		I've been thinking about that 
		since you brought it up before.

				CAROL
			(rising)
		And?

				MELVIN
		No... 
			(and before she can 
			digest that)
		... I don't get this place. They 
		make me buy an outfit but they let 
		you wear a house dress. I don't 
		get it.

	ON CAROL

	Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in 
	extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave.

				MELVIN
		No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't 
		mean it. You gotta sit down. You 
		can still give me the dirty 
		look... just sit down and give it 
		to me.

				CAROL
		Melvin, pay me a compliment... I 
		need one and quick... You have no 
		idea how much what you said just 
		hurt my feelings.

				MELVIN
			(really pissed, 
			mutters)
		That monominute somebody gets that 
		you need them they threaten to go 
		away. Never fails.

				CAROL
		That's not compliment, Melvin... 
		That's just trying to sound smart 
		so I feel stupid... A compliment 
		is something nice about somebody 
		else... Now or never.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

	He waves her down.

				CAROL
			(sitting)
		And mean it... 

				MELVIN
		Can we order first?

	She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. 
	This does not stop Melvin.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Two crab dinners and pitcher of 
		cold beer.
			(to Carol)
		Baked or fries?

				CAROL
		Fries.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		One baked -- one fries.

				STARTLED WAITER
			(shouting back)
		I'll tell your waiter.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Okay, I got a real great 
		compliment for you and it's true.

				CAROL
		I am so afraid you're about to say 
		something awful... 

				MELVIN
		Don't be pessimistic. It's not 
		your style. Okay... Here I 
		goes... Clearly a mistake.
			(this is hell 
			for him)
		I have this -- what? Ailment... 
		And my doctor -- a shrink... who 
		I used to see all the time... he 
		says 50 or 60 percent of the time 
		a pill can really help. I hate 
		pills. Very dangerous things, 
		pills. "Hate," I am using the 
		word "hate" about pills. My 
		compliment is that when you came 
		to my house that time and told me 
		how you'd never -- well, you were 
		there, you know... The next 
		morning I started taking these 
		pills.

				CAROL
			(a little confused)
		I don't quite get how that's a 
		compliment for me.

	Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- 
	so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- 
	then:

				MELVIN
		You make me want to be a better 
		man.

	Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so 
	slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered, 
	momentarily moved and his for the taking.

				CAROL
		That's maybe the best compliment 
		of my life.

				MELVIN
		Then I've really overshot here 
		'cause I was aiming at just enough 
		to keep you from walking out.

	Carol laughs.

				CAROL
		So how are you doing with those 
		pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

				MELVIN
		Takes months to know... They work 
		little by little.
			(holds his head; 
			then)
		Talking like this is exhausting.

	Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very 
	close -- he tenses.

				CAROL
		Have you ever let a romantic 
		moment make you do something you 
		know is stupid?

				MELVIN
		Never.

				CAROL
		Here's the trouble with never.

	TIGHT SHOT

	for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at 
	him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him 
	-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves 
	away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But 
	now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is 
	brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. 
	Melvin can't bear the pleasure.

				MELVIN
		You don't owe me that.

				CAROL
		That wasn't payment. When you 
		first came into breakfast, when I 
		saw you -- I thought you were 
		handsome... Then, of course, you 
		spoke... So now that your soft 
		li'l underbelly is all exposed. 
		Tell me, why did you bring me?

	Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable... 
	as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.

				MELVIN
		Well, ah... that's a personal 
		question.

				CAROL
		Tell me even if you're scared. 
		Tell me why you wanted me here. 
		It's okay.

	She kisses him again.

				CAROL
		If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

				MELVIN
			(dissembling)
		There are lots of reason... I had 
		a thought that if you had sex with 
		Simon it might... 

				CAROL
			(humiliated)
		Sex with Simon?

				MELVIN
		It's one idea... 

				CAROL
		That's why you brought me? Look 
		at me! Is that really why you 
		brought me... Like I'm a what and 
		I owe you what?!

				MELVIN
		I don't know why I brought you -- 
		that idea occurred to me is all... 
		It came out first... Hey, you kiss 
		him -- me... He says he loves 
		you. You two hit it off. But you 
		don't want to... fine... Forget 
		what I said about sex with Simon. 
		It was a mistake.

				CAROL
			(wiping away tears)
		I'll never forget you said it.

				MELVIN
		It was a mistake.

	But she has already turned away and exits the 
	restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.

	INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not 
	breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let 
	the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice, 
	then a humorless male voice:

				PARENTS' VOICE
			(humorless male 
			voice)
		Hi. This is Fred Bishop... 
			(perky woman's 
			voice)
		... and Betty.
			(Fred again)
		We are sorry to be unable to take 
		your call right now. Please leave 
		a message and we'd appreciate your 
		including the time/date and 
		purpose of your call.
			(Simon mouths the 
			word "date," then 
			Betty speaks before 
			the beep Bye-bye.

				SIMON
		Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in 
		town... 
			(he waits)
		... and, folks, you haven't come 
		home later than 10 in your lives. 
		Please pick up -- really... 
		Okay... I'm going to call again in 
		the morning. I need to see you. 
		Or, at least get you to answer the 
		phone.

	He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he 
	needs help.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she 
	goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing 
	things in.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT

				SIMON
		Hello... Hello???

	Carol thrusts open the door and enters... 

				SIMON
		Was this supposed to be your room?

				CAROL
		Our room. I don't want to see him 
		and he's not going to come 
		knocking on your door.

	Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, 
	inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.

				SIMON
		Can you not be violent?

				CAROL
		I don't think so. You need help 
		with the pants?

				SIMON
			(emphatically)
		No!!!

				CAROL
		I'm going to take a big bath and 
		order a big meal.

				SIMON
		Uh-huh... 

				CAROL
		I'm sorry... are you okay?

				SIMON
		Well, considering everything's 
		horrible and tomorrow I have to 
		face my parents... Don't ask me
		... I'm sick of my own complaints
		... got to get me a new set of 
		thoughts.

				CAROL
		Why? What have you been thinking 
		about?

				SIMON
		How to die, mostly.

				CAROL
		Can you believe in our little mix 
		you're the good roommate.

	Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins 
	to prepare a bath.

				SIMON
			(turning off the light)
		Good night.

				CAROL
		Good night.

	We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or 
	sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he 
	faces the bathroom and we have... 

	SIMON'S POV

	Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now 
	as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair 
	-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast 
	exposed... 

	BACK TO SCENE

				SIMON
			(a whisper)
		Hold it.

	He leaves the bed.

	ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK

	What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set 
	and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair 
	and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of 
	the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

				SIMON
		I've got to sketch you.

				CAROL
		No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer 
		than you think. I give the wrong 
		impression sometimes and... 

				SIMON
		I haven't even been thinking about 
		sketching for weeks.

				CAROL
		Stop staring. Do a vase.

				SIMON
		But you're beautiful... your skin 
		glows.

				CAROL
		Thanks. But I just want to take a 
		bath and... 

				SIMON
		That long neck -- the line of 
		you... you're porcelain... your 
		back goes on forever. You're 
		classic... you're why cavemen 
		chiseled on walls... 

				CAROL
		All right, cut me a break.

	Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him 
	earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly 
	but deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right. 
	She's breathtaking.

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to 
	the bartender.

				MELVIN
		So then, the next thing I know, 
		she's sitting right next to me, 
		and then, well, it's not right to 
		go into the details, but I screwed 
		up. I got nervous. I said the 
		wrong thing and if I hadn't, I 
		could be in bed now with a woman 
		who if you could make her smile 
		you got a life. Instead, I'm here 
		with you, no offense, a moron 
		pushing the last legal drug.

	He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his 
	heart breaking.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT

	He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		I don't care how you put it -- 
		We're being naughty here, pal.

	FULL SHOT

	Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a 
	ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His 
	style cramped by his cast.

				SIMON
		No. No. This is great, this is 
		so great. I can't get the angle 
		with this cast.

	He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle 
	no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece 
	from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- 
	a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin is having a room service breakfast.

	The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better 
	than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

				MELVIN
		Did you have sex with her?

	Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the 
	hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.

				MELVIN
		Sorry, didn't realize she was 
		right there.
			(a beat)
		Did you have sex with her?

				CAROL
		To hell with sex.

	Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.

				CAROL
		We held each other. It was better 
		than sex. What I need he gave me 
		great.

				SIMON
		I just love her.
			(beat)
		How're you doing?

	Melvin reacts.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

	Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:

				SIMON
		Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely 
		hear you. Do you have to whisper? 
		No -- don't apologize -- it was 
		the luckiest thing for all of us 
		that you didn't answer last 
		night... I can't hear you... okay, 
		dear, just listen to me then.

	ON MELVIN AND CAROL

	Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings 
	the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in 
	her suitcase.

				MELVIN
		I get why you're angry. It's no 
		snap to explain why I was like 
		that, but let's not try to do it 
		on the run... 

				SIMON
		... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- 
		truly. A little odd that you 
		didn't come to see me when you 
		heard I was hurt, but the 
		important thing I want you to know 
		is your son is happy. I'm working 
		again. I'll make do -- I don't 
		want a thing. Wouldn't take it if 
		it was offered. I'll drop you a 
		note from wherever I land and then 
		it's up to you. I hope we patch 
		things up but know that if we 
		don't, I wish you both the very 
		best... I can't hear you. You 
		heard me, though, right? Good -- 
		take good care. 'Bye.

	He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over 
	to Carol and Melvin.

				MELVIN
		... Now he's going to want to 
		stay. And they'll want to take a 
		ride to the lake or whatever. So 
		it's a good five hours back. It 
		gives us a chance to take it easy 
		and... 

				SIMON
		I'm going back with you.

				CAROL
		But what about... 

				SIMON
		I'll take care of myself --

				MELVIN
		What are you talking about? You 
		got real problems.

				SIMON
		I know. I'm a little bit nervous. 
		Suddenly everything seems so easy. 
		Carol, a load has been lifted.

				CAROL
		One night with me!

				SIMON
		You think you're kidding.

	Melvin stalks out.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The car parked near a phone booth --

				MELVIN
			(to Frank over 
			the phone)
		Aww Jesus! No choice.

	Carol walks up to Simon in the car.

				CAROL
		I got a gift for you.

	She hands him a base ball cap.

				MELVIN
			(on phone)
		Nothing like no choice to make you 
		feel at home.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!

				MELVIN
		Do it then. Get the dog picked 
		up. I can't believe you let it 
		stay there.

	Melvin hangs up the phone.

				MELVIN
		Good-bye.
			(to Simon)
		Well, your luck is holding. They 
		sublet your place. You're 
		homeless. Frank's got a line on 
		another place you can use for now.

				SIMON
		Another place where?

				MELVIN
		Does it matter?

	Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a 
	special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it 
	PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:

				CAROL
		I don't want to hear that music 
		right now.

				MELVIN
		What do you mean? You said you 
		liked it.

				CAROL
		I don't.

				MELVIN
		This one has a special meaning.

				CAROL
		It's your car but I don't want to 
		hear it. If that means anything.

	Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
	proclamation of love.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT

	As the car arrives... They get out... 

				MELVIN
		Here are the keys to my apartment. 
		I'm going to park you in my place 
		while I take Carol home.

				CAROL
			(hefting bag)
		I'll take a bus.

				MELVIN
		I'll take you... why not?

				CAROL
		I don't care what you did for me. 
		I don't think I want to know you 
		anymore -- all you do is make me 
		feel badly about myself.
			(turning to Simon)
		You have my number.

				SIMON
			(hugging her)
		I love you... 
			(sotto)
		Let him take you home.

				CAROL
		Don't want to. I love you.

	She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at 
	Melvin with some sympathy.

				MELVIN
		Don't say anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Where Verdell's ears prick.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As they enter.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I told you to go on in.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Look, I've got to get a hold of 
		Frank and see where I'm hanging my 
		hat 'cause... 

	The door opens, revealing them:

				MELVIN
		I think you gotta camp it here... 

				SIMON
		What are you talking about?

	The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the 
	dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		I know the feeling -- you feel 
		like your ol' self again, huh? --
		Mommy and Daddy are home.

	Melvin reacts.

				SIMON
		Sorry... You're fun to mess with.
	
	Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.

				MELVIN
		They took your place furnished. 
		Jackie said she grabbed your 
		personal stuff -- they were 
		supposed to set you up here.
			(leading the way)
		There's this extra room -- I 
		never use. It gets good light. 
		No other answer really.

	Simon follows.

	INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

	As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small 
	but lovely garret.

				SIMON
		Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm 
		me.

				MELVIN
		They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?

				SIMON
		I love you.

	Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.

				MELVIN
		I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the 
		luckiest guy alive if that did it 
		for me.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and 
	Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each 
	around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully 
	dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we 
	hear Simon's whispered voice.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Where is my big hairy boy?

	Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest 
	approaches.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Verdell, sweeties?

	Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.

				SIMON
		Sorry, didn't know you were awake. 
		I just thought Verdell shouldn't 
		get too used to sleeping in here 
		'cause then... 

				MELVIN
		Look, we both want the dog -- 
		and... 

	The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin 
	doesn't move.

				SIMON
		Should I get it?

	Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several 
	beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Hello.

	ON SIMON

				SIMON
			(into phone)
		Hello. It's me. He took me in. 
		Did you know? Hold on, I'll get 
		him for you.

	He walks back to Melvin's room.

	INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As he enters.

				SIMON
		It's Carol.

	Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one 
	mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.

				MELVIN
		Here. Take the dog.

	As he speeds him out... 

				SIMON
		Good luck.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat 
	loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin 
	-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat 
	clearing.

				MELVIN
		Hello.

				CAROL
		Yeah... Well... 

				MELVIN
			(very concerned)
		How you doing?

				CAROL
		I can trust my brain.

				MELVIN
		That seems like a good choice.

				CAROL
		I don't know whether I'm being 
		sensible or hard on you.

				MELVIN
		The two might go together.

				CAROL
		See. There's an example. I don't 
		know whether you're being cute or 
		crazy now.

				MELVIN
			(what the hell)
		Cute.

				CAROL
		You don't have to answer 
		everything I say. Just listen to 
		me. Okay?

	He nods his head, "yes."

				CAROL
		It's really something that you're 
		looking after Simon. And what I 
		said on the street. That was a 
		bad thing to say. And it made me 
		sick to my stomach. It was a bad 
		thing to say. And I'd be lying if 
		I didn't say that I enjoyed your 
		company... but the truth is you do 
		bother me enormously and I know -- 
		think -- that it's best for me to 
		not have contact with you because 
		you're just not ready and you're a 
		pretty old guy to not be ready... 
		and I'm too old to ignore that. 
		But there were extraordinary 
		kindnesses that did take place. 
		So thanks for the trips... 

	She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than 
	ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.

				MELVIN
		Okay to say something now?

				CAROL
		Go ahead.

				MELVIN
		I should've danced with you.

				CAROL
		Okay. Good-bye.

				MELVIN
		So long.

	Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped. 
	Oh, hell... she missed him.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He 
	is impatient.

				MELVIN
		You going to come talk to me or 
		not?

				SIMON
		I'm coming.

	We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be 
	allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.

				SIMON
		What did she say?

				MELVIN
		I'm a great guy -- 
		"extraordinary"... 
			(before Simon can 
			celebrate)
		... and she doesn't want contact 
		with me.
			(a beat)
		I'm dying here.

				SIMON
		Because... 
			(gently)
		... you love her?

				MELVIN
			(sharply)
		No... and you're supposed to be 
		sensitive and sharp.

				SIMON
		Okay... you tell me why --
			(mimics him)
		"You're dying here."

				MELVIN
		I don't know... Let me sleep on it 
		and figure it out.
			(then)
		Because I'm stuck! Can't go back 
		to what I had... She's evicted me 
		from my life.

				SIMON
		Did you like it that much?

				MELVIN
			(furiously)
		It was better than this... Look, 
		you, I'm very intelligent. If 
		you're going to give me advice or 
		conversation or consolation or 
		hope, you got to be better than 
		you're doing. If you can't be at 
		least momentarily interesting than 
		shut the hell up. I'm drowning 
		and you're describing water.

				SIMON
			(getting pissed)
		Picking on me won't help.

				MELVIN
		Well, if that's true then I'm 
		really in trouble.

				SIMON
		But you know where you're lucky?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely not.

				SIMON
		You know who you want. I'll take 
		your seat any day. So do 
		something... don't sleep on it... 
		go over there. I don't think 
		anybody should ever sleep on 
		anything -- it's not always good 
		to let things calm down.

				MELVIN
		Hey... I'm charged here. But she 
		might kill me for showing up this 
		late.

				SIMON
		Then get in your jammies and I'll 
		read you a story... I think you've 
		got a chance. The only real enemy 
		you have is her ability to think 
		logically -- the best thing you 
		have going for you is your 
		willingness to humiliate yourself 
		if it gives you one chance in 
		whatever -- so go catch her off-
		guard.

				MELVIN
		Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

	He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				MELVIN
		I forgot to lock the door.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - 
	NIGHT

	As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at 
	his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the 
	apartment house.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great 
	uncertainty.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting 
	directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading 
	one of Melvin's books... 

	There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL... 
	someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly 
	-- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL -- 
	until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to 
	her wide open window and looks over.

	HER POV

	The convertible at the curb.

	BACK TO SCENE

	She hesitates --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the 
	sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. 
	He bolts for the door and enters.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN 
	SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.

				CAROL
		What do you want, Melvin?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What do you want?

				MELVIN
		'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm 
		sorry. And you could be grouchy.

				CAROL
		Grouchy?

				MELVIN
		... 'Cause of being woken up, and 
		it would make my job impossible. 
		So then I wouldn't even try.

				CAROL
		What job?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Beverly in the hallway looking on --

	BACK TO SCENE

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry I woke you -- some other 
		time.

	He half turns to leave.

				CAROL
		I wasn't asleep!!

				MELVIN
		What a break... 

				CAROL
			(losing it a bit)
		Is it a secret what you're doing 
		here?

				MELVIN
		I had to see you... 

				CAROL
		Because... 

				MELVIN
		It relaxes me... I'd feel better 
		just sitting on the curb in front 
		of your house than anyplace else 
		I can think of or imagine.

	Carol has not ever heard anything like that before... 
	it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her 
	door down the hallway, has heard at least this last 
	part... 

	Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone... 

				MELVIN
			(serious)
		Wait a minute, I'm overstating 
		here, maybe the inside stairs. I 
		don't want to sit with my feet in 
		the gutter. What does that serve? 
		It only... 

	But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

				CAROL
		Stop it!! Why can't I have a 
		normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out 
		of here. Just a regular boyfriend 
		who doesn't go nuts on me... 

				BEVERLY
			(butting in)
		Everybody wants that, dear -- it 
		doesn't exit... 
			(as Carol turns 
			to her)
		Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

	She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh -- 
	gathers herself. A beat.

				MELVIN
			(hopefully)
		Boyfriend?

				CAROL
		Oh, come on in and try not to ruin 
		everything by being you.

				MELVIN
		Maybe we could live without the 
		wise cracks.

	She looks at him -- then:

				CAROL
		Maybe we could... 

	Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen 
	linoleum and stalls at the door.

				MELVIN
		It feels a little confined here. 
		Let's take a walk.

				CAROL
		See. It's four in the morning. A 
		walk sounds a little screwy to me, 
		if you don't mind.

				MELVIN
		If you need an excuse, there's a 
		bakery on the corner. There's a 
		shot it'll open soon -- that way 
		we're not screwy -- we're just 
		two people who like warm rolls.

				CAROL
		Okay.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT

	They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual 
	attention to where he steps.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement -- 
	it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids 
	stepping on the lines.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing 
	down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious 
	-- his habits making him appear unworthy.

				CAROL
			(gently; almost 
			lovingly)
		I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever 
		this is -- is not going to work.

	ON MELVIN

	He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper 
	something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his 
	history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.

				MELVIN
		I'm feeling... I've been feeling 
		better.

				CAROL
		Melvin, even though it may seem 
		that way now -- you don't know me 
		all that well... 
			(as he scoffs)
		I'm not the answer for you.

	She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns 
	back to him.

				MELVIN
		Hey, I've got a great compliment 
		for you.

				CAROL
		You know what? I... 

				MELVIN
		Just let me talk.
			(gathers himself 
			with uncertainty, 
			then:)
		I'm the only one on the face of 
		the earth who realizes that you're 
		the greatest woman on earth. I'm 
		the only one who appreciates how 
		amazing you are in every single 
		thing you do -- in every single 
		thought you have... in how you 
		are with Spencer -- Spence... 
			(he has reached 
			her)
		... in how you say what you mean 
		and how you almost always mean 
		something that's all about being 
		straight and good... 

	ON CAROL

	She stands on the precipice of being transported away 
	from the logic which has been her lifeline.

				MELVIN
		I think most people miss that 
		about you and I watch wondering 
		how they can watch you bring them 
		food and clear their dishes and 
		never get that they have just met 
		the greatest woman alive... And 
		the fact that I get it makes me 
		feel great... about me!
			(a real question 
			filled with 
			concern for her)
		You got a real good reason to walk 
		out on that?

	That last question clearly a true question, not the least 
	rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

				CAROL
		No! It's certainly not. No -- I 
		don't think so. No.

				MELVIN
			(tentatively)
		I'm gonna grab you.
			(with conviction)
		I didn't mean it to be a question. 
		I'm gonna grab you.

	He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate. 
	A tense beat. Then:

				MELVIN

                                                                      2000

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON

               A COUPLE moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation. 
               All around them trees explode with autumn color. Birds sing. 
               Their path is dappled with leafy shadow.

               To their left, on the sunny meadow, TEENAGERS throw saucers 
               and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and 
               soda, savoring the waning hours of summer.

               CLOSER ON THE COUPLE

               He is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly 
               handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. At first 
               glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war 
               against time has been the undisputed victor.

               Only a closer look hints at the toll of battle. His shoulders 
               strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are 
               touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging 
               disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself.

               Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright. 
               Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her 
               and, if the past prevails, so many will come after.

               She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking --

                                     WILLS
                         -- and I could have waited to tell 
                         you, but I wanted to leave no room 
                         for misunderstanding.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well, you certainly didn't.

               EXT. ANOTHER CENTRAL PARK WALKWAY -- LATER

               Still talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area 
               of the park--

                                     WOMAN
                         No, I see how you could feel this 
                         way. Of course I do. It's human. But 
                         what I don't get is why you'd want 
                         to announce it so quickly. I mean, 
                         we just met. Feelings change. You 
                         don't even know me.

                                     WILLS
                         Yes, I do.

               She is amused by his confidence --

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, really?

                                     WILLS
                         The minute I laid eyes on you. It's 
                         the saddest thing about getting older. 
                         You know people so quickly. I even 
                         knew you'd end up hating me.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well, you're wrong. I don't.

                                     WILLS
                              (with a weary smile)
                         Give it time.

               She laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops. 
               She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns 
               and looks, squinting into the sun.

               He takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO 
               DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs -- 
               most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual-
               bohemian look to them.

               Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, 
               willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an 
               eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright, 
               her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         -- and for weeks I sat by her bed 
                         and cried. I told her I loved her 
                         and I begged her not to leave me. 
                         All I could think about was what I'd 
                         lose if she died. And then one 
                         night... she was in really bad pain... 
                         I stopped thinking about myself for 
                         a second and I thought about her.
                              (fighting tears)
                         I stopped crying. I said goodbye. 
                         And in less than an hour Ella was 
                         gone.

               The woman whispers in Wills' ear --

                                     WOMAN
                         It's so sad.

               But Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen 
               interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I really think it's possible to hold 
                         a person back... cry them back... 
                         from dying. That's what I did to 
                         Ella and I'll never do it to anyone 
                         else again.
                              (softly)
                         I hope no one ever does it to me.

               She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear 
               runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away.

               The woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers --

                                     WOMAN
                         So what do you know about her?

               He knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But 
               his answer is nonchalant --

                                     WILLS
                         That she's just a kid.

               He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. 
               He steals one last look back.

               Charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills. 
               Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them.

               Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair --

                                     OLD MAN
                         I met Ella at City College in 1938...

               Wills slowly turns and walks away.

               MUSIC AND TITLES IN:

               EXT. MANHATTAN SUBWAY STOP -- AUTUMN DUSK

               A SWARM OF PEDESTRIANS ascends the steps to the bustling 
               street.

               FIND CHARLOTTE amid the swarm, struggling with a load of 
               BOXES and SHOPPING BAGS, carrying an antique, wood-and-wire 
               DRESSMAKER'S MANNEQUIN.

               She wears a peasant dress with a cycle jacket, a backpack, 
               and another eccentric hat.

               EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK -- DUSK

               Charlotte makes her way down the leaf-strewn pathway. Wheeling 
               the mannequin by the neck, she passes NYU STUDENTS smoking, 
               laughing, and chatting on their way to class.

               EXT. WEST VILLAGE AVENUE -- DUSK

               Charlotte hauls the mannequin down the block. A YOUNG MAN 
               offers her assistance, but she politely and firmly refuses.

               EXT. WEST VILLAGE STREET -- DUSK

               Charlotte wearily hauls the mannequin across the cobblestone 
               street, over the curb, and up to the stoop of a charming but 
               slightly dilapidated BROWNSTONE.

               INT. BROWNSTONE FOYER -- DUSK

               Charlotte opens the door into the darkness. She hits a light 
               switch and nothing happens. She flips it back and forth --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Shit.

               She dumps her boxes and bags, then wheels in the mannequin.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Dolly! The bulb burned out!

               MUSIC AND TITLES OUT:

               INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- SAME

               EIGHT SILHOUETTES are crouched in the dark room. The mantel 
               is draped with a HAPPY BIRTHDAY BANNER. The coffee table is 
               stacked with WRAPPED GIFTS.

               INT. FOYER -- SAME

               Charlotte looks suspiciously at the living room door --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Dolly?

               She tiptoes through the darkness and lays her ear against 
               it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM -- SAME

               We hear chuckles and whispers of anticipation. An older 
               woman's raspy, boozy voice growls --

                                     RASPY VOICE
                         My ass hurts.

               A few people chuckle, but they're quickly hushed. The DOOR 
               KNOB TURNS and the DOOR OPENS. Everyone leaps up in a blaze 
               of light --

                                     ALL
                         SURPRISE!

               The MANNEQUIN bursts into the room, teetering crazily, wearing 
               CHARLOTTE'S JACKET, BACKPACK, and HAT.

               Everyone FLINCHES and SCREAMS. Amid a chorus of laughter, 
               Charlotte enters. Grinning, she wags a facetious finger --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         See? Surprises suck!

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               An antique clock ticks crisply on the dresser. Wills stands 
               before a mahogany mirror, buttoning a freshly laundered white 
               shirt.

               Lying on the cradle bed, half-wrapped in a sheet, naked but 
               for a string of pearls, is TANYA, 35, raven-haired, much too 
               thin. She smokes a cigarette.

                                     TANYA
                         Oh, Wills, please, not again. It's 
                         our third date and we're already in 
                         a rut.

                                     WILLS
                         But I thought you loved it.

               She stretches with her cigarette but before she can make it 
               to the ashtray, her ASH FALLS on a New York magazine.

               On the cover is a PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLS standing next to a 
               YOUNG CHEF in a fashionable restaurant. The caption reads: 
               "The Prodigal Son Returns."

                                     TANYA
                         Oh, I do -- except for the fact that 
                         there isn't a single thing on the 
                         menu I can eat.

                                     WILLS
                              (with a chuckle)
                         Sure, there is; there's just very 
                         little you're willing to digest.

               He slips in a cuff link. She affects a breezy indifference --

                                     TANYA
                         Fine then. We'll go, I'll get big, 
                         fat, and horrible, and it'll serve 
                         you right.

               Wills slips on a silk tie --

                                     WILLS
                         No, it won't. Because it takes at 
                         least a few weeks to get fat and by 
                         then you won't even be speaking to 
                         me.

                                     TANYA
                              (curiously)
                         Why do you say that?

               He stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror --

                                     WILLS
                         Because we have no future. All I can 
                         offer you is this... what we have 
                         right now... nothing more 
                         meaningful... until it ends.

               He goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly --

                                     WILLS
                         I could have waited to tell you, but 
                         I wanted to leave no room for 
                         misunderstanding.

               She stares at him, speechless.

               INT. RESTAURANT -- THAT NIGHT

               Its decor is exquisitely tasteful, its ambiance warm and 
               convivial. The night is in full swing. Most of the tables 
               are taken and the bar is packed.

               EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- SAME

               From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI breaks free and glides 
               to the curb in front of the RESTAURANT.

               Its facade is windowless. Only a small brass plaque on the 
               grey marble reveals that this is ELYSIUM.

               Wills and ERIKO, 30's, Japanese, aloof and stunning, emerge 
               from the taxi, elegantly dressed, and move to the front door.

               INT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS

               TWO TIPSY DEBUTANTES pass Wills and Eriko as they enter. One 
               recognizes Wills and smiles flirtatiously.

               Wills stops and helps Eriko off with her jacket. JESUS, 30, 
               the dashing Cuban-American maitre d', superbly discreet, 
               approaches --

                                     JESUS
                         Good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be 
                         dining with us tonight?

                                     WILLS
                         We certainly will. Table seven, Jesus, 
                         if it's available.

                                     JESUS
                         Yes, sir.

               Wills hands Eriko's jacket to MELISSA, 20, the hat check 
               girl --

                                     WILLS
                         How are you, Melissa?

                                     MELISSA
                              (blushing)
                         Fine, Mr. Keane.

               CELIA, mid-20's, the chipper, blonde Midwestern hostess, 
               arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile.

                                     WILLS
                         Good evening, Celia. And how --

                                     CELIA
                              (with forced cheeriness)
                         Just dandy, sir, thanks!

                                     JESUS
                         Table seven.

                                     CELIA
                         This way, please.

               Celia, barely making eye contact with Eriko, walks quickly 
               away. Wills is amused and a little confused by Celia's 
               behavior. He lays a hand on Eriko's back --

                                     WILLS
                         I'll be right with you.

               Eriko nods and follows Celia.

               Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend 
               and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, 
               dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to 
               someone on the telephone.

               Wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear --

                                     WILLS
                         How's it going?

                                     JOHN
                              (covering the phone)
                         Chaos.

                                     WILLS
                         The house specialty.

                                     JOHN
                         Easy for you to say, ya prick. 
                         Waltzin' in here like you own the 
                         joint.

               Wills laughs and takes a look into the bar. John gestures 
               with his head in Eriko's direction --

                                     JOHN
                         So who's the new potential ex-wife? 
                         I thought you were still wastin' 
                         time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name.

                                     WILLS
                         We wisely agreed to cut our losses.

               Wills exits into the bar. John smiles and shakes his head.

               FOLLOW WILLS, as he glides along the bar. CUSTOMERS and STAFF 
               greet him warmly.

               As he enters the main dining room, DINERS spot him -- 
               sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of city 
               life. Wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and 
               kiss their cheeks.

               Suddenly, Celia, the hostess, red-faced, blocks his path --

                                     CELIA
                         Look, I have no right to say this, 
                         okay? And you can fire me if you 
                         want, but in the six weeks we've 
                         been open you've brought in six 
                         different women -- tonight makes 
                         seven -- and it's really starting to 
                         get to me.

                                     WILLS
                         In what way?

                                     CELIA
                         I have to greet them! It's like 
                         working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid 
                         to learn their names or even smile 
                         at them because I know any minute 
                         they could be put down!

                                     WILLS
                         I assure you it's an absolutely 
                         painless procedure.

               Shocked, she can't help but sputter a laugh --

                                     CELIA
                         It is?

                                     WILLS
                         Sure.
                              (beat)
                         Especially for me.

               They both laugh. He moves closer, lowers his voice, and speaks 
               with warm sincerity --

                                     WILLS
                         Actually, I appreciate your concern, 
                         Celia. The truth is I'm a little 
                         worried myself.

                                     CELIA
                         Seriously?

                                     WILLS
                         Seriously. I've been trying to do 
                         better.
                              (uneasily)
                         But... you know how it is... old 
                         habits die hard.

                                     CELIA
                         So I'm not fired?

                                     WILLS
                         Nope. In fact, John's been looking 
                         for an assistant. Tell him you've 
                         just been promoted.

               Wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on. She 
               can't believe it.

               A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with candles 
               and decorated with a WOMAN'S HAT made of MERINGUE LATTICEWORK -- 
               passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM.

               From inside, VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Wills, his 
               curiosity piqued, follows.

               INT. REAR DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               The waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round table. 
               There's a CHEER and APPLAUSE as the song ends. Wills cannot 
               see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view.

               Just as Wills is about to exit the room, the waiter steps 
               away. Wills glances over and sees the birthday girl. At first 
               he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens 
               and brightens.

               It's Charlotte. She wears a black velvet dress and a 
               wonderfully eccentric hat. Her eyes glow in the candlelight. 
               Through the chorus of voices, urging her to make a wish, she 
               cries out --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You guys! Let me think!
                              (concentrating)
                         Okay. Okay.

               Charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than 
               you might expect, extinguishes the candles. Everyone APPLAUDS 
               and CHEERS.

               To Charlotte's right sits SIMON LORING, late 20's, English, 
               sardonic, adoring. He gestures at her CHEST and says --

                                     SIMON
                         Watch carefully, everyone -- they 
                         ought to begin emerging any moment 
                         now.

               Everyone laughs. Charlotte playfully slaps him --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Very funny! Actually, any moment now 
                         you're gonna turn straight and fall 
                         at my feet.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, darling, you know I would if I 
                         could.

               Charlotte's best friend, SHANNON HARRIS, 19, a spoiled but 
               big-hearted redhead, drowning in curls, mutters --

                                     SHANNON
                         The only time he falls at your feet 
                         now is when he wants to borrow your 
                         Prada loafers.

               More laughter.

               BACK TO WILLS. He considers approaching Charlotte, but then 
               he looks back and sees Eriko sitting alone at their table, 
               idly stabbing at her drink with a straw.

               Regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but 
               then hears --

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Is that Wills Keane?

               He turns and sees DOLORES TALBOT, 70, blonde wig, spindly 
               frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes. She holds a mixed 
               drink --

                                     WOMAN
                         It sure as hell is and he hasn't 
                         changed a bit!

                                     WILLS
                         I'm sorry, do I --

                                     WOMAN
                         You little fool, it's Dolores Talbot. 
                         Dolly!

               His smile shows uneasy surprise --

                                     WILLS
                         My God, it is.

                                     DOLLY
                         Yeah, I know, time's kicked my ass 
                         but good. Come on, Romeo, let's bury 
                         the hatchet. Give me a hug. Careful 
                         of the cocktail.

               As he hugs Dolores, he can't help but look over at Charlotte 
               again.

                                     DOLLY
                         So what the hell're you doin' around 
                         here? Last I heard you were out in 
                         earthquake country blowin' the family 
                         fortune.

                                     WILLS
                         Actually, I doubled it.

                                     DOLLY
                         Good for you!

               ON CHARLOTTE. She looks over. Her view is such that she sees 
               Wills but not Dolores.

               A faint blush creeps into Charlotte's cheeks. She pretends 
               to listen as Shannon tells a story --

                                     SHANNON
                         -- and you know how bouncer's get. 
                         He's like, "That's the worst fake 
                         I.D. I've ever seen." And I'm like, 
                         "Yeah? Well, you have the worst dread-
                         extensions!" And then just when --

               Noticing Charlotte's distraction, Simon whispers calmly to 
               her --

                                     SIMON
                         Are you feeling all right? You look 
                         positively green.

               Charlotte speaks under her breath without moving her lips --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         He's here. And he's staring at me 
                         again.

                                     SHANNON
                         No way!

               Both Shannon and Simon turn to look, but like lightning 
               Charlotte grabs them both --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Don't!
                              (to Simon)
                         Wait a few seconds, then go to the 
                         bathroom.

                                     SIMON
                         How will I know him?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         He's beautiful. And much older.

                                     SIMON
                         Really?
                              (getting up)
                         If he's rich you might have a fight 
                         on your hands.

               Charlotte watches furtively as Simon rises from his chair 
               and walks over. As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive 
               smile. Wills is confused by it.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Okay, look.

               Shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare 
               in Wills' direction. Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth 
               agape --

                                     SHANNON
                         He's as old as my dad!

               Charlotte laughs.

               BACK ON WILLS. He does his best to be attentive as Dolores 
               exhales a plume of smoke into his face --

                                     DOLLY
                         Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus 
                         or a lizard, but if you're a New 
                         Englander, your soul dries up and 
                         blows away like a god damn leaf.

                                     WILLS
                         It only took me twenty years to come 
                         to my senses.

                                     DOLLY
                         So what're you doin' now? You owned 
                         some restaurants out there, didn't 
                         you?

               ON CHARLOTTE. She sits listening to Shannon --

                                     SHANNON
                         And so, after all that, we pay our 
                         cover, we get in, and it's totally 
                         heinous! Nothing but losers and --

               Charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, shit.

                                     SHANNON
                         What?

               Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm --

                                     DOLLY
                         Kids! I want you to meet an old chum 
                         of mine, the owner of this fine 
                         establishment -- Wills Keane!

               The table greets him. Wills, slightly self-conscious, looks 
               at everyone but Charlotte.

                                     DOLLY
                         And that over there's the birthday 
                         girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte.

               The news hits Wills hard. But he does his best to hide it. 
               He musters a casual smile --

                                     WILLS
                         Not Katie and Jay's daughter?

                                     DOLLY
                         You bet. She got her height from her 
                         dad. But her talent's all Katie's.

               Dolores indicates the hat that Charlotte's wearing --

                                     DOLLY
                         Made it herself from scratch. That 
                         one, too.
                              (to Shannon)
                         Honey, show 'im.

               Shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat 
               she's wearing. The table laughs.

               Wills levels his gaze at Charlotte --

                                     WILLS
                         Impressive.

               Try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, 
               Charlotte can't help but grin.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks.

               The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES 
               OF CHAMPAGNE on ice. He reaches for one. Wills stops him --

                                     WILLS
                         I think we can do better than that.

               The steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the 
               champagne with him.

                                     WILLS
                         Happy birthday, Charlotte.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks.

                                     SHANNON
                              (under her breath)
                         Twenty years old and never been...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (laughing)
                         Shut up!

               Amused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile.

                                     WILLS
                         I'll let you get back to your 
                         celebration.
                              (kissing Dolly's cheek)
                         A pleasure to see you again.

                                     DOLLY
                         Same here.

               Wills turns to exit. Simon, returning to his seat, murmurs 
               seductively to Wills as he passes by --

                                     SIMON
                         Leaving so soon?

               Wills looks at him, confused again, then continues on. As 
               Simon sits, he mutters to Charlotte --

                                     SIMON
                         Be still my beating heart.
                              (beat)
                         Or is that your heart?

                                     SHANNON
                              (whisper to Charlotte)
                         You're not really into him, are you?

               Charlotte turns to Dolores who has just sat down.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hey, Dolly, how do you know him?

                                     DOLLY
                              (uneasily)
                         From Newport. Old friend of your 
                         mom's.

               Dolores eats a sloppy forkful of birthday cake.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WINDOW -- ESTABLISHING -- MORNING

               A gentle breeze tickles a white lace curtain. A PHONE RINGS.

               INT. BROWNSTONE KITCHEN -- SAME

               Charlotte, standing in the small antiquated kitchen, wearing 
               flannel pajamas, tenses when she hears the PHONE RINGING 
               UPSTAIRS. She snatches an apple from a bowl and dashes out 
               of the room.

               FOLLOW CHARLOTTE running through the DINING ROOM... into the 
               LIVING ROOM... into the FOYER... and up a DARK STAIRCASE.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

               A startling clash of childhood, adolescence, and womanhood. 
               Everything from stuffed animals to posters of pop icons to 
               volumes of great literature.

               THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN

               Charlotte bangs in, flings herself on the bed, and grabs the 
               phone --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Okay, bitch, I'm ready!

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. WILLS' ROOFTOP TERRACE -- MORNING

               Wills sits in his woolen robe, holding a portable phone. 
               Amused, he smiles into the morning sun --

                                     WILLS
                         For what?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh my God, I'm so sorry! Wait. Who 
                         is this?

                                     WILLS
                         Wills Keane.

               Her heart stops. She sits up slowly, her body tensed.

                                     WILLS
                         Who did you think it was?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         My friend Simon, actually. He always 
                         calls me the morning after to sort 
                         of... you know... sum everything up.

                                     WILLS
                         And how would you sum it up, 
                         Charlotte? Turning twenty.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Kinda cool, kinda creepy. Anyway, 
                         you wanna speak to my grandmother?

                                     WILLS
                              (with a chuckle)
                         I don't think so.

               OLIVIA, 30's, Wills' Jamaican cook and housekeeper, enters. 
               Plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray 
               laden with continental breakfast and a New York Times. Wills 
               mouths a greeting. She smiles back and sets the tray on a 
               table.

                                     WILLS
                         I called because I'm going to be 
                         attending a benefit... a black-and-
                         white ball.... and I'd like you to 
                         design a hat... for my date.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Really? Wow. Sounds fun. Okay.

                                     WILLS
                         It's a gift. I don't have her 
                         measurements, but she's about your 
                         size. What're you, a six?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     WILLS
                         Good -- then let's assume your hat 
                         size is also the same.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But that doesn't necessarily --

                                     WILLS
                         It's a risk we'll just have to take.

               Charlotte runs over to her sewing table, looking for a pen 
               and paper. She finds paper, but no pen --

                                     WILLS
                         Her dress is a sheath... sleeveless, 
                         black. The hat must, of course, be 
                         black or white or both.

               She finds a pen but it doesn't work. She grabs an eyeliner 
               and uses that --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Any particular style?

                                     WILLS
                              (sipping his coffee)
                         No, just plenty of it. How long will 
                         it take?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         A week or two.

                                     WILLS
                         You have till Thursday. I'll need it 
                         here by seven o'clock. I'm at the 
                         Pembroke on Central Park West and 
                         76th.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh. Wow. Okay.

                                     WILLS
                         What's your fee?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (faltering)
                         I don't really have one. I usually 
                         just make them for friends.

                                     WILLS
                         How's five hundred dollars?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Really? Wow.

                                     WILLS
                         Charlotte?

               His tone has abruptly shifted; it's intimately hushed. It 
               both daunts and excites her --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah?

                                     WILLS
                         You say "wow" a lot.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know.

                                     WILLS
                         It has to stop. You're a woman now.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know.

                                     WILLS
                         Bye.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Bye.

               She clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and 
               breaks out laughing.

               Wills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the 
               middle distance.

               He snaps to when Olivia enters. Her accent is as much Queens 
               as it is Caribbean --

                                     OLIVIA
                         See, now you got me worried.

                                     WILLS
                         What do you mean?

                                     OLIVIA
                         You slept alone last night. You must 
                         be sick or somethin'. You want me to 
                         call a doctor?

                                     WILLS
                         Thank you, no, I'm fine.

               She throws him a sly, sidelong glance, then exits. Wills 
               laughs and contentedly sips his coffee.

               FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the sound of SQUEALING, LAUGHING, 
               SHOUTING CHILDREN.

               INT. FAO SCHWARZ -- NIGHT

               Surrounded by swarming PARENTS and KIDS, Wills stands with 
               John, the manager of Elysium, and his wife, SARAH VOLPE, 30, 
               who, gazing out of frame, keeps a watchful eye on their kids --

                                     JOHN
                         Save it, pal! Don't even bother! I 
                         may not have gone to a fancy school 
                         like Bendover --

                                     WILLS
                              (to Sarah)
                         That would be Andover.

                                     SARAH
                         Sure, if his folks could have afforded 
                         it.

                                     JOHN
                         -- but when Wills Keane comps three 
                         bottles of Dom to a twenty-year-old 
                         girl, then tells me he did it 'cause 
                         he likes the kid's grandma, I smell 
                         a rat!

                                     SARAH
                              (looking around)
                         Oh, is that what that is? I figured 
                         there was a dirty diaper somewhere.

                                     WILLS
                              (lightly)
                         Okay, I admit it, she interests me.

                                     JOHN
                              (turning to Sarah)
                         He's gonna do it! I don't believe 
                         it! He moved us back here for nothing!

                                     SARAH
                         So much for that turned leaf.

                                     WILLS
                              (amused)
                         Come on, you're overreacting.

                                     JOHN
                         Is that what you think? Buddy, since 
                         we hit town, I have done nothin' but 
                         cut you slack! Every week a new woman 
                         on your arm and I didn't say a word. 
                         Why? 'Cause I figured at least they're 
                         in the right demographic. Maybe by 
                         accident you'll trip over something 
                         substantial. But this little girl? 
                         Best she could be is Miss Right's 
                         daughter!

                                     WILLS
                              (uneasily)
                         I know. It's just that there's 
                         something about her. She's special... 
                         and I just thought --

                                     SARAH
                         "She's young. She's hot. I'm on the 
                         verge of menopause. Why not go for 
                         it?"

               Wills and Sarah meet eyes.

                                     WILLS
                         There wouldn't be much point in lying 
                         to you, would there?

               Sarah shakes her head.

                                     KIDS' VOICES
                         Mommy, Daddy, look, look!

               MOLLY and CARLA, the Volpes' five-year-old TWIN DAUGHTERS 
               run up, beaming, each carrying a huge stuffed animal.

                                     JOHN
                         Hey, they're bigger than you are!

               John scoops both his daughters up in his arms and kisses 
               them repeatedly.

               Wills watches, his eyes filling with a vague, wistful envy. 
               He sees Sarah staring at him. She smiles sympathetically.

               INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

               The furniture is antique and dark. The white walls are tinged 
               with yellow from years of cigarettes. In one corner, the 
               paint has chipped off the ceiling in a jagged plate.

               Dolores sits on a worn-out leather arm chair, smoking, sipping 
               a cocktail, watching a DAYTIME TALK SHOW.

               In the background, we see Charlotte working in the ADJOINING 
               DINING ROOM which she has turned into a lovely sewing room.

               CLOSER ON CHARLOTTE. She builds her hat on a HAT BLOCK -- a 
               wooden mannequin head. Strewn all around her are the materials 
               of her hatmaking -- bolts of cloth, hat blocks, a sewing 
               table.

               Shannon, wearing sweats and a T-shirt, lies on the floor, 
               eating M+M's and drinking diet soda, while heavily marking 
               up a text book with a YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER.

               Charlotte stops and rubs her eyes, then she glances down at 
               Shannon and smiles --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why don't you mark what isn't 
                         important? That way you'll save ink.

                                     SHANNON
                         Why don't you sew your mouth to my 
                         butt? That way you'll stop annoying 
                         me.

               They both laugh. Overhearing, Dolores croaks facetiously --

                                     DOLLY
                         Now, now, if you two kids can't play 
                         nice --

               Shannon rolls over onto her back --

                                     SHANNON
                         God, I hate school.

               Charlotte pins a strip of black lace to the hat --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, come on, just last week, you 
                         said you were on a roll. You loved 
                         it!

                                     SHANNON
                         Well, now I'm on the rag and I hate 
                         it.

               Charlotte chuckles and sets the half-finished hat on her 
               head. Still seated, she wheels her work chair over to a mirror --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I think you're incredibly lucky. I'd 
                         love to be going to college.

               Shannon rolls over and looks at her. Suddenly her expression 
               is inexplicably solemn --

                                     SHANNON
                         Am I the most spoiled brat in the 
                         world or what?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Spoiled brats don't even ask questions 
                         like that.
                              (re: the hat)
                         What do you think?

               She models the hat. Tears well in Shannon's eyes and she 
               says without even a hint of irony or sentimentality --

                                     SHANNON
                         That you're the most beautiful person 
                         in the entire world.

               Charlotte smiles, looks away, and, trying not to cry, fusses 
               with the hat.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST -- NIGHT

               A cold autumn rain falls. The Irish doorman, MICHAEL, 60's, 
               melancholy, stoop-shouldered, smokes a cigarette, looking up 
               at the unburdening sky.

               A LIMOUSINE pulls up. The passenger window glides down --

                                     DRIVER
                         Mikey! How ya doin'?

                                     DOORMAN
                         A bit early, aren't you?

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey, in this soup, better safe than 
                         sorry, you know what I mean?

               RUNNING FOOTSTEPS approach. Michael looks. The driver looks, 
               too.

               It's Charlotte, dressed in tattered jeans, a light rain coat, 
               and sneakers, dashing at breakneck speed down the street, 
               carrying something in a GARBAGE BAG.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         KEANE!

               She runs right past Michael --

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               Michael works the shiny brass controls. Charlotte, winded, 
               hair dripping wet, watches the numbers tick by overhead. 
               Michael smiles at her with paternal fondness --

                                     MICHAEL
                         He's goin' to a fancy party tonight.

               Charlotte, nonplused by his lack of discretion, smiles 
               politely --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, really?

               INT. WILLS' PENTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

               The elevator doors open.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Watch your step, Miss.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thank you.

               She emerges, moves to Wills' door, and waits for the elevator 
               to close. When it does, she hurries back to a table over 
               which hangs a GILDED MIRROR.

               She takes a LOVELY OLD HAT BOX out of the garbage bag and 
               ditches the bag under the table. Then she quickly checks 
               herself in the glass.

               She doesn't like what she sees. She pokes at her sopping 
               hair and squeezes it, but it's hopeless. Remembering the 
               time, she hurries back to the door, takes a deep breath, and 
               rings the bell.

               She waits. And waits. Then she hears footsteps approaching. 
               She realizes she's left the hat box on the table.

               She rushes over and grabs it, just in time to get back to 
               the door when it OPENS.

               Olivia, the housekeeper, steps out, wearing her coat and 
               carrying her purse. Her voice is low and gentle --

                                     OLIVIA
                         He's waitin' for you, Miss Fieldin'.

               They exchange cordial smiles. Charlotte enters.

               INT. WILLS' APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

               Charlotte steps into a dim hallway lined with oil paintings, 
               carpeted with a Persian runner, and lighted by three antique 
               sconces. She walks slowly, terribly self-conscious.

               INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               The room is vast, furnished with antiques, decorated with 
               the same masculine good taste. Charlotte enters timidly, 
               then hears --

                                     WILLS
                         What happened?

               She looks and sees Wills standing, back turned, before a 
               broad set of high windows. City lights glimmer in the 
               distance; beneath them lies the vast gloom of Central Park.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I couldn't get a cab, so I took the 
                         subway... only it was an express and 
                         it didn't stop at --

                                     WILLS
                         You realize, don't you, that you're 
                         a full eighteen minutes late?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know... I'm so sorry... I --

               Wills turns around. A magnificent figure -- expertly tailored 
               tux, every hair in place, freshly manicured. And then he 
               offers her an amused, reassuring smile --

                                     WILLS
                         Charlotte, relax. What's the point 
                         of being a beautiful young woman if 
                         it isn't to keep your admirers 
                         waiting? In fact, you disappoint me: 
                         I was looking forward to at least 
                         another half hour of suspense.

               Flattered, her face brightens --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I could leave and come back.

                                     WILLS
                         Nope, too late. Anyway, I want to 
                         see the hat.

               He walks over to her. Smiling, she sets down the box, unties 
               the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat. It's sublimely 
               simple and elegant. She looks at him with hope. His face 
               betrays nothing --

                                     WILLS
                         Try it on.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I can't. I'm soaked.

                                     WILLS
                         It's all right.

               Charlotte, a little confused, carefully sets the hat on her 
               head. She steps to a wall mirror, pulls the veil down, and 
               sets it at the correct angle.

               Wills appears behind her and shares the reflection. She feels 
               his presence, hears his breathing. They speak in hushed tones --

                                     WILLS
                         It's perfect. It's like a tiny 
                         sculpture.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I wanted it to be a tiny poem.

               She smiles. Their eyes meet in the glass.

                                     WILLS
                         If only I had some use for it.
                              (off her look)
                         My date canceled a few hours ago.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why?

                                     WILLS
                         I don't know. She was vague. Would 
                         you... like to come in her place?

               Charlotte can't believe it. She smiles at his reflection.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Like this?

                                     WILLS
                         The outfit I bought her is hanging 
                         in the guest room closet.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (anxiously)
                         It's okay? Are you sure?

                                     WILLS
                              (amused)
                         Of course.

               He gestures toward the half-open door on other side of the 
               room. Charlotte turns and, biting her lip, looks at the door, 
               then back at Wills, then back at the door.

               INT. GRAND BALLROOM, PLAZA HOTEL -- NIGHT

               A spectacular affair is in full swing, a benefit for the 
               METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART attended by FIVE HUNDRED GUESTS 
               from HIGH SOCIETY dressed only in black and white.

               A LARGE BAND plays -- everything from waltzes to jazz to 
               swing. Chandeliers glisten. Guests, sitting in ornate boxes, 
               look down on the marble dance floor where a WALTZ is in 
               progress.

               FIND WILLS AND CHARLOTTE, dancing together. Charlotte looks 
               sophisticated and beautiful beyond measure, wearing a 
               sleeveless black sheath with a fake fur wrap, and, of course, 
               her hat.

                                     WILLS
                         Nonsense. You're very good. Where 
                         did you learn?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         From Ella. The woman whose memorial 
                         you crashed.

                                     WILLS
                         So you did see me there.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh-huh. And the next time I saw you, 
                         you were on the cover of New York 
                         magazine. And I had to pick a place 
                         for my birthday. So...

               It takes a few beats for Wills to put it together. He smiles, 
               realizing that her presence at Elysium wasn't a coincidence. 
               She smiles back, sweetly, coyly.

               ON THE PERIMETER, FIND TWO RICH WOMEN, 40's, too thin, too 
               lifted, watching Wills and Charlotte waltz.

               They stand with LISA, 23, unassuming, fair-haired, simply 
               dressed.

                                     RICH WOMAN #1
                         Of course he moved back. I mean, 
                         he'd already seduced every A- and B-
                         list actress in town. What was left 
                         for him?

               Pause. Lisa looks at her, feigning naivety.

                                     LISA
                         The C-list?

                                     RICH WOMAN #2
                         Exactly.

                                     RICH WOMAN #1
                         But if what I hear is true and he's 
                         shopping for a bride, I can tell you 
                         one thing -- he's barking up the 
                         wrong tree there.

                                     LISA
                         Why do you say that?

                                     RICH WOMAN #1
                              (with an icy smile)
                         Good wives are rarely found up cherry 
                         trees.

               The women share a laugh. Lisa, slightly discomposed, looks 
               back at Wills and Charlotte.

               INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- LATER

               Wills and Charlotte slow dance to a romantic ballad. Wills 
               seems entranced by her easy manner of expression --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I met Ella in the fourth grade. She 
                         was my teacher at the Little Red 
                         School House. We stayed friends after 
                         she retired. She taught me how to 
                         cook and sew... speak Italian... 
                         basically enjoy life, have fun -- 
                         that's what she was best at... even 
                         when she knew she was dying.
                              (pause)
                         The most important thing she did was 
                         introduce me to poetry. She believed 
                         it was the highest form of art and 
                         that everything we say and do should 
                         aspire to it.

               Wills is uncomfortable for a moment, then ventures quietly --

                                     WILLS
                         It sounds as though, in a way, she 
                         took your mom's place...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         My mom and my dad's. After they died, 
                         Dolly was so devastated she pretty 
                         much gave up on everything. It was 
                         like if something that tragic could 
                         happen, there was no way she was 
                         ever gonna care about anyone else 
                         ever again. Including herself. She 
                         wasn't a horrible parent... she didn't 
                         abuse me or anything... she just 
                         ignored me. She was more like a weird 
                         landlady than a grandmother.

               Charlotte smiles sadly. Her eyes glisten in the light.

                                     WILLS
                         I'm sure she did the best she could.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         For a long time I kinda thought that, 
                         too, and I made excuses for her, but 
                         now I don't. I was seven years old 
                         and I needed her and she wasn't there.

               Silence as Wills somberly reflects. Finally, he speaks --

                                     WILLS
                         I remember when I heard the news 
                         about your parents. You know how 
                         after a crash they print a long list 
                         of names in the newspaper? Well, I 
                         grew up outside Boston, so I naturally 
                         started to scan the list. But 
                         casually, not expecting to --

               Suddenly, a SWING SONG starts. Wills smiles at the ironic 
               change of mood, then turns to escort Charlotte away --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, no, come on! I love this stuff! 
                         Don't you? Didn't you grow up on it?

                                     WILLS
                         How old do you think I am?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ancient!

               Holding his hand, she starts moving to the music. Wills laughs --

                                     WILLS
                         I have no idea what to do!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Have fun!

               She flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing. Wills, 
               charmed senseless, finally surrenders.

               A SEQUENCE BEGINS during which we see WILLS and CHARLOTTE 
               having an inordinately good time. Wills maintains a modicum 
               of reserve; Charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed.

               CERTAIN GUESTS NOTICE THEM. The reactions to their pairing 
               runs from confusion to disgust to amusement.

               But no one watches them more carefully than Lisa.

               Finally, in the middle of a song, Wills and Charlotte make 
               their way off the floor, winded and laughing. Wills heads 
               off to the bar. Charlotte turns around and watches the other 
               dancers.

               Then we notice Lisa standing next to her. They smile at each 
               other. Lisa offers her a cocktail napkin. Charlotte takes it 
               and wipes off her brow.

               They speak above the music --

                                     LISA
                         I had to come. I work at the Met. 
                         What's your excuse?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Sort of a date.

                                     LISA
                         With Wills Keane, right?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You know him?

                                     LISA
                         Just by reputation.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         A major womanizer, right?

                                     LISA
                         That's what they say.
                              (beat)
                         I'm Lisa.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Charlotte Fielding.

               They shake hands. Lisa looks away and sees Wills making his 
               way toward them with two glasses of punch.

               Coolly covering, Lisa beats a hasty retreat --

                                     LISA
                         Anyway, I should keep mingling. But 
                         it was nice to meet you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Same here.

               Lisa smiles politely and walks away.

               Wills walks up, watching Lisa melt into the crowd. His brow 
               is furrowed. He's wondering if his eyes have deceived him. 
               He hands Charlotte a punch --

                                     WILLS
                         Who was that?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Lisa something.

               The name hits home. Wills is flustered, but then he covers 
               as best he can and lifts his glass --

                                     WILLS
                              (lifting his glass)
                         Here's to --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Us.

               Wills smiles slowly and they toast.

               INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               The room is empty. There's laughter in the distance. The 
               front door opens and shuts. We hear Wills and Charlotte, 
               both a little tipsy, advancing down the hall toward us --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         God, you talk like you're a hundred 
                         and sixteen!

                                     WILLS
                         That's usually how I feel. But not 
                         tonight. Tonight I feel sixteen... 
                         just sixteen... and three-quarters.

               Wills crosses to the bar and from a small refrigerator pulls 
               out a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE already sitting in an ice bucket.

                                     WILLS
                         Champagne?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         He asked nonchalantly.

               Wills laughs, then opens the bottle as he picks up his 
               previous train of thought --

                                     WILLS
                         You see, Charlotte, the way you know 
                         you're getting older is that you 
                         start to notice patterns. People 
                         start falling into types. Pretty 
                         soon you know a person before you've 
                         even been introduced. And if it's a 
                         woman, before the romance even starts, 
                         a whisper in your head tells you 
                         exactly what it is and how long it's 
                         going to last. And the saddest, the 
                         most tedious, part of all is that 
                         that little voice is almost always 
                         right.
                              (popping the cork)
                         Now, what I like about you -- and I 
                         think that's actually what inspired 
                         this little lecture -- is that I 
                         find you completely unprecedented... 
                         and, therefore, wholly unpredictable.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         God, it must be a relief.

                                     WILLS
                              (confused)
                         What?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         To finally deliver that speech to a 
                         woman and actually have it apply to 
                         her.

                                     WILLS
                         Now wait a minute.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, because coincidentally I am all 
                         those things you just said. And more.

               Wills chuckles, shaking his head, charmed but a little 
               unsettled.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm a "unique". At least that's what 
                         my yoga teacher says. He says there 
                         are very few uniques in the world 
                         and I'm one of them.

                                     WILLS
                         Well, he's a wise man.

               He hands her a glass of champagne.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You, on the other hand, are what 
                         he'd call a "typical."

                                     WILLS
                         Oh, really?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh-huh. And I can prove it. Want me 
                         to? Come here.

               Wills moves a few steps closer.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Closer.

               Wills walks even closer, until they are just a few feet apart.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, come on, really close.

               Wills can't believe his good luck. He nears her until their 
               faces are almost touching.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Perfect. Now watch very carefully.

               She rises on tiptoe and puts her mouth just inches from his.

               Their breathing mingles. Wills seems almost dizzied by it.

               And then, very slowly, he kisses her.

               She does not kiss back.

               Finally, he pulls away, staring blankly, breathing hard, not 
               sure what to say.

               Charlotte whispers --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         See? You're a typical.
                              (pause)
                         And for what you just did, most girls 
                         my age would slap your face. Or ask 
                         to be put in a cab.
                              (pause)
                         Lucky for you, I'm a unique.

               She smiles, then kisses him deeply on the mouth. Her arms 
               wrap around his neck.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Cloaked in deep shadow, set off against a rainy window pane, 
               we see Wills, his shirt off, on top of Charlotte whose blouse 
               is open. He passionately kisses her neck and mouth.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- MORNING

               The room is bathed in golden light. Charlotte lies naked 
               under the covers asleep on her stomach. Her brow is tense 
               and one of her hands is slightly clenched.

               ANGLE ON WILLS, standing in the doorway, watching her, his 
               face a portrait of conflicted thoughts.

               Finally, she stirs. Smiling and squinting into the sun, she 
               gets up on one arm and looks at him, standing there in the 
               doorway --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Boy, do you look guilty.

               EXT. WILLS' TERRACE -- LATER

               Charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast. Wills 
               sits across from her, watching and worrying.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Didn't anyone ever teach you that 
                         it's bad manners to stare at a girl 
                         when she's eating like a pig?

               Wills chuckles, then his smile fades and he clears his throat.

                                     WILLS
                         Listen --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh-oh. Here it comes.

                                     WILLS
                         That's right, because, look, I could 
                         put this off, but I genuinely like 
                         you. So I want to be clear... right 
                         now... from the start, so there's no 
                         chance for misunderstanding later.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Okay.

                                     WILLS
                         What I want to say you is.... well... 
                         that all I can offer you is this... 
                         what we have right now... nothing 
                         more substantial... just this... 
                         until it ends.

               She looks at him. Lowers her fork. He adds almost reluctantly --

                                     WILLS
                         The truth is, we have no future 
                         together.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know. I'm dying.

               Wills' face reddens slightly. He shifts uneasily in his chair. 
               A suggestion of a smile plays along his features --

                                     WILLS
                         What... what do you mean?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What I said. Nobody thought I'd even 
                         last this long.

               Wills stares at her blankly, not knowing what to think or 
               say.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I could have put off telling you, 
                         but I genuinely like you, so I wanted 
                         to be clear... you know, right from 
                         the start.

               Olivia enters, takes her orange juice glass and leaves a 
               full one.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks, Olivia!

               Charlotte gulps down the juice. Wills watches, his mind 
               reeling.

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Wills sits across from a large desk, beneath a wall of framed 
               certificates and diplomas. The door opens and DR. PAUL SIBLEY, 
               60, African-American, dour and forbidding, enters --

                                     SIBLEY
                         Mr. Keane? Dr. Sibley.

               Wills jerks to his feet and they shake hands --

                                     WILLS
                         Thank you so much for taking the 
                         time.

                                     SIBLEY
                         It's my job, sir. Please, sit down.

               He walks around the desk. Sibley is all business, but his 
               brusqueness masks genuine regret --

                                     SIBLEY
                         Now, Mr. Keane, on the phone you 
                         referred to Charlotte's condition as 
                         cancer. That isn't strictly accurate. 
                         Neuroblastoma is a soft tissue 
                         malignancy, but it isn't cancer -- 
                         although it sometimes can be just as 
                         aggressive.
                              (sitting)
                         It's most common in children. In 
                         young adults, the condition is 
                         extremely rare. In Charlotte's case, 
                         the tumor is located in her chest. 
                         It's growing rapidly and has proved 
                         resistant to both irradiation and 
                         chemotherapy. And because of its 
                         proximity to her aorta, surgery is 
                         out of the question.

                                     WILLS
                         So then what treatment is she getting?

                                     SIBLEY
                         At present? Nothing.

               Wills shifts uneasily in his chair.

                                     SIBLEY
                         Eventually she'll be treated for 
                         pain. In the end, surgery could become 
                         an option, but her chances of survival 
                         would be slim. Right now Charlotte's 
                         against it. She's signed a directive 
                         forbidding any sort of heroic 
                         intervention.

               A silence settles between them. Sibley opens a folder on his 
               desk.

                                     SIBLEY
                         There's more here if you're 
                         interested, but it won't mean much 
                         to you.

               Wills shakes his head and rises from his chair. He turns to 
               the door, then turns back to the doctor --

                                     WILLS
                         How long?

                                     SIBLEY
                         Optimistically? A year.

               EXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- LATER

               Wearing her tattered jeans from the night before, Charlotte 
               sits on the couch doing the New York Times crossword. Wills 
               emerges, walking slowly, pensively, as though in a trance.

               Charlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         A real charmer, isn't he?

               Wills doesn't react. He keeps walking toward her. Unsettled, 
               she holds up the puzzle.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How are you on Cambodian money units?

               Wills keeps advancing.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Are you okay, old man? You look kinda 
                         woozy.
                              (jokingly calling out)
                         Is there a doctor in the house?

               Ignoring her, Wills sits down, takes her in his arms, and 
               embraces her. At first she resists, but slowly she surrenders 
               and hugs him back.

               INT. TAXI -- AFTERNOON

               As the cab bounces down a cobblestone Village street, Wills 
               and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each following the 
               tortuous path of his own thoughts.

               Slowly, Charlotte steals a sidelong look at him. His face is 
               tense, ashen, and unreadable --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hey.

               Wills slowly turns his head. She smiles sweetly --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Look on the bright side: if I weren't 
                         sick, there's no way we could hang 
                         out together.
                              (off his look)
                         I'm serious. You'd be scared of 
                         hurting me and I'd be scared you 
                         were just using me for my perfect 
                         young body.

               He can't help but smile. Encouraged, she moves closer --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         And then our friends would say we 
                         were just into each other for weird 
                         psychological reasons. You know, 
                         because I'm looking for a daddy 
                         substitute and you're looking for 
                         someone you can feel superior to so 
                         you won't have to confront how scared 
                         you are of real intimacy -- and, of 
                         course, they'd be right and eventually 
                         we'd break up.
                              (beat)
                         But since I'm so sick it doesn't 
                         really matter what deep-seated 
                         weirdness has brought us together 
                         because there's no way we can possibly 
                         screw each other over... or up... 
                         because that takes time. And I don't 
                         have much left.

               The cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone. She smiles 
               archly, savoring the irony --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         So considering everything, don't you 
                         think we should just sort of chill 
                         out, forget I'm sick, and enjoy what 
                         we have... right now... no strings... 
                         just this... until it ends? 'Cause 
                         that's really all I have to offer.

               Wills grimly appreciates the irony.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Think about it, okay? But not too 
                         hard.

               She kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab. She skips up 
               the steps of the brownstone, then immediately turns around 
               and runs back down to the open window.

               She leans in and mutters sexily --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Last night was so incredibly hot.
                              (beat)
                         By the way -- it was my first time. 
                         And I picked you for the job. I hope 
                         you're flattered.

               Wills is shocked. She turns and runs back upstairs. She sticks 
               in the key, then turns and waves at Wills before banging 
               open the door with her hip.

                                     DRIVER
                         Okay, pal, where to?

               Wills hasn't moved a muscle.

               FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the pop of FLASHBULBS and the 
               whirr of SHUTTERS --

               INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT -- NIGHT

               YOUNG FASHION MODELS OF EVERY RACE strut down a runway, 
               modeling a new line of WOMEN'S URBAN CASUAL WEAR.

               FIND CHARLOTTE, ignoring the show, pushing through the crowd, 
               hurrying toward the side of the stage. She speaks to a GUARD 
               at the entrance and he lets her pass.

               INT. BACKSTAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

               Charlotte searches amid the chaos of models dressing and 
               undressing. Finally, she spots them.

               FIND SIMON AND SHANNON styling a BLACK FEMALE MODEL in a 
               tank top and fatigues.

               He applies a finishing touch, adjusting the tilt of the 
               model's baseball cap. Shannon, lacing the girl's boots, works 
               as Simon's assistant.

               EXT. SOHO STREET -- NIGHT

               The threesome, in high spirits, bangs open a fire door. 
               Shannon is beside herself, frantically half-screaming --

                                     SHANNON
                         I don't believe it! I don't believe 
                         it!

                                     SIMON
                         I think what Miss Harris is trying 
                         to say, is that you've strained her 
                         credulity.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Really? Better put some ice on that.

               Shannon lifts a hand to high-five her --

                                     SHANNON
                         Girlfriend, you are so incredibly 
                         cool!

                                     SIMON
                         So I've been told.

               Simon high-fives her instead. The girls laugh.

                                     SHANNON
                         Okay, now tell us everything! Don't 
                         leave anything out!

               FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear --

                                     JOHN'S VOICE
                         Okay, then what happened?

               INT. ELYSIUM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               The restaurant is empty. John stands behind the bar, taking 
               an inventory of the liquor. In the background, TWO BUSSERS 
               mop up. Wills sits on a bar stool, nursing a mineral water --

                                     WILLS
                         Not much. I took her home and she 
                         pointed out an irony -- that fate 
                         was now offering us the very same 
                         thing that just this morning I'd 
                         told her was all I could offer her: 
                         a relationship with no future.

                                     JOHN
                              (chuckling)
                         A kid figured that out?

                                     WILLS
                         She's not a kid! That's what I've 
                         been trying to tell you. Nothing's 
                         lost on her. I'm the kid. She... I 
                         don't know what the hell she is...
                              (muttering)
                         But I do know what she was.

               John looks at him curiously. Wills glances over his shoulder 
               at the bussers, then leans in close --

                                     WILLS
                         A virgin.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

               The busboys turn their heads.

                                     WILLS
                         I had no idea. That's the only reason 
                         she had her party here, so she could 
                         lure me into doing the honors.

                                     JOHN
                              (grinning)
                         She used you, pal.

                                     WILLS
                         I know.

                                     JOHN
                         The hangman got hanged. How's it 
                         feel?

                                     WILLS
                         Embarrassing.

               John laughs. Wills settles into a brooding silence. John 
               goes back to work --

                                     JOHN
                         So what now?

                                     WILLS
                         I end it.

                                     JOHN
                         How come?

                                     WILLS
                         What, you're endorsing this now?

               John, continuing his work, smiles sweetly --

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know, when you talk about 
                         her, you're not such an arrogant son 
                         of a bitch. You get all whiny and 
                         stupid. I like that.

                                     WILLS
                         Thanks.

                                     JOHN
                         And since I don't see you gettin' 
                         serious with any of your other 
                         victims, I figure why not spend a 
                         little time together?

               Pause.

                                     WILLS
                         Because she's dying.

                                     JOHN
                         I got bad news for you, brother, so 
                         are you.

               Wills stares at him thoughtfully.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE STOOP -- DAY

               Wills stands stiffly at the door, holding a bouquet of 
               flowers. He stares at his own reflection in the porthole 
               window. He straightens his hair, tugs at the collar of his 
               cashmere jacket.

               Footsteps approach. The door opens and there's Dolores, bleary-
               eyed and disheveled. She smiles sourly --

                                     DOLLY
                         Well, well.

               INT. BROWNSTONE FOYER -- CONTINUOUS

               Through the dark prism of Dolores' inhospitable wariness, we 
               catch glimpses of the high-society hostess she once was --

                                     DOLLY
                         She'll be right down. She's upstairs, 
                         gildin' the lily.
                              (shouting up the stairs)
                         HE'S HERE!
                              (wryly)
                         Do come in.

               They move through a doorway --

               INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Wills is surprised by the room's run-down state.

                                     DOLLY
                         Excuse the mess. My maid died fourteen 
                         years ago and it's been simply 
                         impossible to replace her. She did 
                         windows and spoke English.

               She chuckles to herself. Wills hands her the flowers.

                                     WILLS
                         For you.

                                     DOLLY
                         Well, aren't they loverly.

               She casually drops them into an EMPTY BLENDER at the bar.

                                     DOLLY
                         Care for a cocktail?

                                     WILLS
                         No, thanks.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- SAME

               Simon lounges on the bed. Charlotte stands before a full-
               length mirror, trying on a dress.

                                     SIMON
                         It really is uncanny. I tell you, in 
                         that dress you're the spitting image 
                         of Michel Simon.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (flattered)
                         Who's she?

                                     SIMON
                         A French character actor, long dead, 
                         who was not only hideous and fat, 
                         but quite male.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         So that would be a "no."

               Simon nods. Charlotte takes off the dress.

               INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- SAME

               Wills looks around the room. Dolores splashes her drink with 
               vodka --

                                     DOLLY
                         What can I say? Time's a thief. One 
                         day you're rich as an Arab, the next 
                         you're lucky if you can afford a god 
                         damn can of pistachio nuts.

               Wills wanders over to the mantel where FAMILY PHOTOS sit in 
               tarnished antique silver frames. He picks up a photograph of 
               a YOUNG GIRL in TENNIS WHITES -- it's Charlotte's mother, 
               Katie.

               Wills' face is suffused with tenderness as he studies it. 
               Dolores walks over and looks --

                                     DOLLY
                         How about that, huh? That was the 
                         summer you two --

                                     WILLS
                         I know.

                                     DOLLY
                         Who'd have guessed what time had in 
                         store for her, huh? Look at that 
                         smile.

               Eyes moistening, Dolores crosses to her armchair. Her tone 
               is slightly bitter --

                                     DOLLY
                         Then again, time loves some people. 
                         Like you, for instance. Oh, time's 
                         just wild about you.

               She plops down unsteadily and reaches for her cigarettes --

                                     DOLLY
                         Just as handsome and charming as 
                         ever. And still up to the same old 
                         tricks.

               Wills sets the photo back on the mantel --

                                     WILLS
                         What do you mean?

                                     DOLLY
                         First time you came to pick up Katie, 
                         you brought me flowers. Just like 
                         those.
                              (to herself)
                         Flower the mother; then deflower the 
                         daughter. But Katie was too smart 
                         for you...

                                     WILLS
                         Dolly, look --

                                     DOLLY
                              (abruptly)
                         Aw, why the hell don't you leave her 
                         alone? Christ, she's sick!

               But before Wills can answer, they hear footsteps on the 
               stairs. Neither moves.

               Charlotte enters, wearing a peasant dress and felt hat, 
               looking pretty, pale, and excited.

               Wills and Dolores slowly turn. They smile at her, then 
               exchange a quick glance. Charlotte catches it and becomes 
               self-conscious --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What? What's wrong?

                                     DOLLY
                         You look like your mom is all.

               Charlotte looks to Wills to see if that's, indeed, what he 
               was thinking. He nods his agreement. She is pleased.

               EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET -- MINUTES LATER

               Charlotte, full of energy, hauls Wills down the block by the 
               hand.

                                     WILLS
                         What do you mean, you knew?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I did! I just didn't think it would 
                         take so long!

                                     WILLS
                         Two days is long?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It is when you're sitting by the 
                         phone. You wanna know how I knew?

                                     WILLS
                         You're psychic?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I am, but no -- it's because of my 
                         birthday wish.

                                     WILLS
                         But we hadn't even been introduced 
                         yet.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know, but I wished that whatever 
                         happened... you know, with my 
                         illness... I'd go out with a bang. 
                         Nothing heavy. No violins. No 
                         melodrama. Just fun. A total 
                         adventure!

               Charlotte jumps off the curb.

                                     WILLS
                         CAREFUL!

               He yanks her back just as a TAXI, horn blaring, SPEEDS PAST, 
               nearly hitting her.

               For a moment, they both stand there, hearts pounding, 
               breathing hard. Then Charlotte looks back at him and grins --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Wow, it's getting exciting already.

               EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK -- AFTERNOON

               Under a perfect blue sky, the park swarms with autumn 
               celebrants. Charlotte and Wills move together down a walkway.

               Half-joyously and half comically, Charlotte addresses the 
               heavens with grand theatricality --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         "Lord, I do fear 
                         Thou'st made the world too beautiful 
                         this year! 
                         My soul is all but out of me, -- let 
                         fall 
                         No burning leaf; prithee, let no 
                         bird call!"

                                     WILLS
                         We could go to a museum.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, that would be a thing! I don't 
                         want to do any thing today. I want 
                         to do no thing all day.

                                     WILLS
                         Nothing at all?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh-huh. No thing at all.

                                     WILLS
                         So a movie is out.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Way out!

                                     WILLS
                         Ice cream at the Plaza? High tea at 
                         the Palace?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Both out.

                                     WILLS
                         What about shopping?

               She considers for a few moments --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Possible.

                                     WILLS
                         It's not a thing?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Only when I have money.

               EXT. FIFTH AVENUE IN THE 50'S -- AFTERNOON

               The sidewalk swarms with pedestrians. Wills and Charlotte 
               emerge empty-handed from the revolving door of a department 
               store --

                                     WILLS
                         But all I gave you was champagne. 
                         That's not a proper birthday present.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I agree, and I promise I'll let you 
                         give me something else, but not today.

                                     WILLS
                         When?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Soon. But I'm warning you, it's not 
                         going to be anything material.

                                     WILLS
                         Why not?
                              (then solemnly)
                         Oh, I see... because you're sick. 
                         Because --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's right, but we're not gonna 
                         talk about that.

                                     WILLS
                         How come?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Because it's my rule.

                                     WILLS
                         Any particular reason?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah, because everybody always wants 
                         to talk about miracles, or about 
                         some genius quack-doctor, or their 
                         friend's friend who went into 
                         remission eating nothing but sunflower 
                         seeds. It's boring and pointless.

                                     WILLS
                         Are you sure? I mean, there are 
                         specialists who --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Don't start, okay?
                              (abruptly)
                         Now what I would enjoy is taking you 
                         shopping. For clothes. I'm serious. 
                         It's quality not quantity, you know.

               INT. BARNEY'S MEN'S DEPARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

               Wills sits in a chair while Charlotte looks through silk 
               scarves --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         At work you should look perfect, but 
                         in everyday life you need to delight 
                         in disorder more. Don't you know? "A 
                         sweet disorder in the dress kindles 
                         in clothes a wantonness."

                                     WILLS
                         I think that goes without saying.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It was true when that poem was written 
                         three hundred years ago and it's 
                         true today. Wouldn't it be fun to 
                         look wanton occasionally?

                                     WILLS
                         It's been a lifelong dream of mine. 
                         But will a scarf do it?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Totally. Accessories rule. But we 
                         have to be careful. I don't want you 
                         looking too young. Nothing's worse 
                         than an old guy trying to look young.

                                     WILLS
                         Good advice. I'll remember that for 
                         when I get old.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You know what I meant.

                                     WILLS
                         That I'm old.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh-huh.

               INT. BARNEY'S LOBBY -- LATER

               Wills walks a little self-consciously. He wears around his 
               shoulders a sloppily draped wrinkly silk scarf.

               He walks past OTHER SHOPPERS. Among a GROUP OF WOMEN walking 
               past him FIND CHARLOTTE who subtly checks him out as though 
               he were a stranger.

               As she passes by, she gives him a sexy look, then, not very 
               subtly, she spins around to look at his ass.

               Finally, she breaks character, runs after him, and throws 
               her arms around his neck from behind.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Perfectly imperfect!

               Laughing, he holds her hands and hauls her on his back to 
               the door.

               INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

               Wills and Charlotte are in the middle of a candlelight dinner. 
               Wills refills her wine glass --

                                     WILLS
                         I don't know why, but for some odd 
                         reason, I feel absolutely compelled 
                         to tell you the truth about this... 
                         even at the risk of --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hey, you're giving me the creeps. 
                         Just spit it out.

               Wills holds his breath for a moment, then exhales and says 
               it --

                                     WILLS
                         I never had a date for the benefit. 
                         My plan from the beginning was for 
                         you to come with me.

               Charlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it together --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         So I made the hat for myself?
                              (He nods.)
                         And you bought that dress for me?
                              (He nods.)
                         And you did all this just so you 
                         could sleep with me?
                              (He nods.)
                         Why? I mean, why me?

               Wills settles himself, then, meeting her eyes, speaks softly --

                                     WILLS
                         The eulogy you gave at Ella's service 
                         was so... impressive. You spoke about 
                         her death... about loss... in a way 
                         that I could never have done. You 
                         understood life emotionally in a way 
                         that I didn't. Whatever that 
                         understanding was, I wanted to get 
                         close to it.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         And sex seemed like the best way to 
                         do it.

                                     WILLS
                         And the most enjoyable, yeah.

               Charlotte sips her wine and considers. Then she sets down 
               her glass --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, first of all, let me say, you 
                         have great taste because that little 
                         Dolce & Gabbana was to die for.

                                     WILLS
                         Thanks.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         And, second, don't ever lie to me 
                         again.

                                     WILLS
                         All right.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Seriously. There isn't a lie in the 
                         whole world I'd rather hear than the 
                         truth.

               Wills stares at her solemnly. Her expression just as somber, 
               she lifts a hand and points to her lips. He leans forward to 
               kiss her.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Wills and Charlotte, kissing deeply, tumble fully clothed 
               onto the bed. As their passion builds, Wills reaches for the 
               bedside lamp.

               Charlotte watches curiously, thoughtfully, as he pulls the 
               cord, plunging the room into UTTER DARKNESS.

               MUSIC UP: A SEQUENCE BEGINS

               -- Savoring the last sunny days of autumn, Wills and Charlotte 
               walk across the green of Central Park, which swarms with 
               happy, healthy teenagers.

               -- At night, Wills and John and his wife Sarah sit in box 
               seats at Yankee Stadium watching the play-offs. Bernie 
               Williams hits a colossal shot. The crowd jumps to its feet. 
               As the ball flies over the right field wall, we see that 
               Charlotte sits next to Wills, munching a hotdog, her nose 
               buried in a book, utterly uninterested.

               -- In Elysium's kitchen, Wills watches on as Charlotte, 
               wearing an apron over her clothes, prepares bisque under the 
               approving eye of the CHEF. She quickly and expertly pours a 
               cup of cream and a cup of broth into a large blender. Then 
               she dumps in lobster meat and adds some saffron. Just when 
               she, with a dramatic flourish, is about to hit the start 
               button, Wills INTERRUPTS and puts the lid on the blender.

               -- One morning, Charlotte sits up in bed doing the Sunday 
               New York Times crossword puzzle. Olivia sits on the chair 
               next to the bed, chatting and laughing with her. Wills enters, 
               carrying a silver tray laden with breakfast. Olivia looks up 
               and gestures haughtily for him to set it down, as though he 
               were the housekeeper.

               -- At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Wills and Charlotte 
               wander amid the shadows of Egyptian ruins.

               MUSIC OUT.

               INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM LOBBY -- LATER

               Flipping through a stack of postcards he has just purchased, 
               Wills waits for Charlotte to come out of the ladies room.

               He idly glances up as a STREAM OF TOURISTS moves past. He is 
               about to look away when his eye catches someone.

               It is Lisa, the young woman who spoke to Charlotte at the 
               benefit. Around her neck she wears a chain bearing a Met 
               employee photograph I.D. She carries a take-out coffee.

               Wills FOLLOWS HER, agitated and curious.

               He sees her pass through a set of glass doors into the Watson 
               Research Library.

               He hurries over to the doors just in time to see her disappear 
               behind a bank of card catalogues.

               Wills notices a sign at the door that forbids entry to the 
               public. He hesitates, then enters.

               He speaks to the first person he sees -- a ROTUND FEMALE 
               LIBRARIAN IN HER 60'S. He stops and asks a question about 
               Lisa. She nods.

               Wills is shaken by the answer. He stares into the middle 
               distance, wondering what to do, his mind racing.

               The librarian, a little nervous now, reminds him that he is 
               not allowed in the library. He snaps to, thanks her, and 
               moves away.

               But then he stops, takes out a BUSINESS CARD, and returns to 
               the librarian. He is about to hand it to her, but then he 
               thinks better of it.

               Flustered, he thanks her again and exits. The librarian looks 
               after him, confused and a little apprehensive.

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY -- SAME

               Wills sees Charlotte at the end of the hall looking around 
               for him. When she spots him, her face brightens. She calls 
               out facetiously as she walks to him --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I thought I told you to wait right 
                         there!

                                     WILLS
                         I got restless.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, I hope you didn't talk to 
                         anybody!

                                     WILLS
                         Not a soul.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Wills and Charlotte stand, disrobing in the near-total 
               darkness. They converse in whispers, between kisses --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You know what would scare me right 
                         now?

                                     WILLS
                         What?

               Charlotte moves slowly through the darkness.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         This.

               She yanks a cord by the window. The BLIND OPENS and the room 
               is flooded with MOONLIGHT. The room is still dark, but she 
               is far more clearly visible.

               Her dress is unbuttoned down the front. She walks back to 
               him and stops about five feet away.

               She releases the last buttons on her dress, then slides it 
               off her shoulders to the floor. She wears only her underwear. 
               She crosses her arms over her breasts, and smiles --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Have I told you my latest motto?

                                     WILLS
                         No.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         If it's scary, do it.

                                     WILLS
                         I'm not sure I like that motto.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm not sure that matters.

               She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, then slips off her 
               underwear. She drops her arms to her side.

               She stands before him entirely naked.

               Her self-consciousness is excruciating but she is determined 
               to endure it. Finally, she opens her eyes and smiles with a 
               hint of pride.

               Wills' eyes widen as he takes her in. He crosses to her and 
               lays his hands on her hips. He kisses her neck.

               As their breathing quickens, she begins to unbutton his shirt 
               and pull it free of his pants.

               He takes hold of her hands, stopping her, and starts to ease 
               her toward the bed. She resists. Wills falters and she 
               realizes something.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh my God.

                                     WILLS
                         What?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You're scared, too.

               From his expression, she knows she is right.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Your turn.

               For the first time since we've met him, Wills is utterly at 
               a loss. But he sees that Charlotte has no intention of backing 
               down.

               He begins to undress. His hands are uncertain as he untucks 
               his shirt and unbuckles his belt. When he is finished 
               undressing, he turns to face her, his arms at his side.

               Although we cannot see him in the moonlight and shadows, 
               Charlotte can. She looks down at his naked body and studies 
               it. He stares back with shy wariness.

               Then she breaks into a crooked grin --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What's the matter, old man? Can't 
                         afford a gym?

                                     WILLS
                         That's it!

               Laughing, he grabs her wrists and throws her on the bed. She 
               dissolves into paroxysms of laughter.

               INT. WILLS BEDROOM -- LATER

               Wills and Charlotte make love. As their passion builds, 
               Charlotte is suddenly stabbed with a pain in her chest.

               She grabs his back, her face twists. She holds her breath, 
               not wanting to reveal the incident to Wills. She closes her 
               eyes and exhales as the pain subsides.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- LATER

               Wills and Charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and the 
               city glimmering in the distance.

               Charlotte's head rests on his chest. Eyes closed, he brushes 
               his hand along her face as though he were a blind man 
               committing every detail to memory.

               Charlotte's voice, almost inaudible, drifts up through the 
               dark --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         "Counting the beats, 
                         Counting the slow heart beats, 
                         The bleeding to death of time 
                         In slow heart beats, 
                         Wakeful they lie."

               Wills, half-asleep, murmurs deeply --

                                     WILLS
                         So many words in that wonderful head 
                         of yours...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         If I could give you anything in the 
                         whole world, that's what it would 
                         be.

                                     WILLS
                         Words?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Poetry.

               They lie in silence.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Dusk falls on the park. Charlotte, red-cheeked and happy, 
               carrying shopping bags, walks into a brisk autumn breeze.

               She smiles at a BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS, dressed in HALLOWEEN 
               COSTUMES, being led on their trick or treating.

               INT. ELYSIUM REAR OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

               Wills sits at a desk, reading the newspaper. John, inspecting 
               a KING HENRY VIII COSTUME on a hanger, shouts into the 
               telephone --

                                     JOHN
                         Oh no, your boy made it! At ten 
                         minutes before close! All night I 
                         got a card announcing a halibut 
                         special, only I got no halibut! Now 
                         it's Sunday and I got three dozen 
                         cats lickin' their chops in the alley! 
                         Tony, I don't wanna hear it! I don't 
                         wanna hear it! I don't wanna -- MAN, 
                         GO TO HELL!

               He slams down the phone. His face is beet red. Wills looks 
               up calmly from his paper --

                                     WILLS
                         Are you familiar with the phrase, 
                         "You can catch more flies with honey 
                         than with vinegar?"

                                     JOHN
                         Are you familiar with the phrase, 
                         "Mind your own god damn business?"

                                     WILLS
                         Sure, it's from Poor Richard's 
                         Almanac. But the last time I checked --

                                     JOHN
                         No, your business is to smile, make 
                         friends, and get rich! My business 
                         is the business.

               John heads out, then stops abruptly and looks back. His tone 
               is suddenly calm and curious --

                                     JOHN
                         What're you doin' here, anyway? You 
                         got a girl. Go home. Carve a pumpkin.

                                     WILLS
                         We can't spend every waking moment 
                         together.

               John looks at him strangely, with a hint of suspicion --

                                     JOHN
                         Why not?
                              (pause)
                         No, seriously. Why not?

               Wills has no answer. John moves closer when Celia, his new 
               assistant, enters cheerily --

                                     CELIA
                         Special delivery!

               She tosses him a paper bag; he catches it.

                                     WILLS
                         No trouble?

                                     CELIA
                         None.

               Wills removes a PAIR OF RED PLASTIC HORNS. John shakes his 
               head with disbelief.

                                     JOHN
                         Every year. You got no imagination.

                                     WILLS
                         It's a classic. A little spirit gum 
                         and voila!

               He holds the horns up to his forehead.

                                     WILLS
                         -- young women are rendered helpless.

                                     CELIA
                         It's true. I see a guy with horns 
                         growing out of his head and my knees 
                         go weak.

                                     WILLS
                         Of course -- it's biological.

               They share a laugh. A flirtatious charge passes between them. 
               She blushes slightly and exits. John looks suspiciously at 
               Wills.

                                     JOHN
                         What's goin' on?

                                     WILLS
                         What do you mean?

                                     JOHN
                         At home.

               Wills smiles at him as though he were insane --

                                     WILLS
                         Nothing. Honestly. We're having a 
                         lot of fun. We're very happy.

               From the next scene, we hear Charlotte laughing --

                                     CHARLOTTE'S VOICE
                         Don't come in! Don't!

               INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

               A fire burns in the fireplace. Still wearing his coat, wills 
               stands by the mantel, sorting through a stack of mail --

                                     WILLS
                         I'm not even tempted!

                                     CHARLOTTE'S VOICE
                              (from another room)
                         I'll be right out!

               Olivia enters with a steamy mug --

                                     OLIVIA
                         You like hot cider?

                                     WILLS
                         Sure, thanks.

               She carefully takes his coat off him as he sips the cider --

                                     WILLS
                         Mmmm.

                                     OLIVIA
                         Charlotte made it. I just poured it 
                         in the cup.

               She exits. As Wills sips the drink, he sits on the leather 
               sofa and continues to glance through his mail.

               Suddenly, shocked, he stops on a letter. He sets his mug 
               down. He hears Charlotte making noise in the next room. He 
               opens the letter and begins to read.

               His eyes dart down the page, but he quickly sees that the 
               letter is not friendly. His face shows disappointment.

               He hears footsteps in the hall. He folds the letter up, slips 
               it back into its envelope, and jams it in his back pocket.

               Charlotte enters and throws her hands out to her side --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ta-da!

               She stands before him, dressed in a WHITE SPINSTERLY VICTORIAN 
               OUTFIT with braids coiled at her ears. Wills smiles with 
               appreciation --

                                     WILLS
                         Incredible.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Don't I look just like her?

                                     WILLS
                         Absolutely incredible.

               Pause.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You have no idea who I am.

                                     WILLS
                         Give me a hint.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         "Hope is the thing with feathers 
                         that perches in the soul."

                                     WILLS
                         Was that the hint?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You dummy! Emily Dickinson! Only the 
                         greatest American female poet ever!

               She hugs and kisses him --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uncultured swine.

                                     WILLS
                         The truth is out. I've lost you 
                         forever.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Wanna bet?

               She lays her head on his chest, smiling contentedly. A subtle 
               shadow of apprehension passes over Wills' features. Eyes 
               closed, she asks --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         When do I get to see your costume?

               EXT. BROOKLYN BROWNSTONE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT

               A cardboard ghost hangs on the door. A Jack-o'-lantern grins 
               in the window. A HALLOWEEN PARTY is in full swing.

               INT. BROOKLYN LIVING ROOM -- SAME

               John's wife, Sarah, dressed as QUEEN ELIZABETH, walks through 
               the crowd, picking up empty glasses and bottles.

               As she moves among COSTUMED GUESTS and their CHILDREN, we 
               notice a few of Elysium's customers and staff, including 
               Celia, dressed as GLINDA, talking to the maitre d', Jesus, 
               dressed as a COWBOY --

                                     JESUS
                         No, I think we make a great couple. 
                         A good witch and a bad hombre. That 
                         could make for some very interesting 
                         sex.

               Celia laughs.

               INT. BROOKLYN KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

               Wills stands off to the side, wearing his devil's horns, 
               sipping a drink, watching an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY bob for 
               apples, while other BOYS and GIRLS cheer him on.

               John, wearing his king costume, supervises, as the boy, wildly 
               sputtering, struggles to bite into a renegade Granny Smith.

                                     JOHN
                         O, Ricky, chill out! You're gonna 
                         get snot in the water!

               The boy laughs even harder. John facetiously grabs his collar --

                                     JOHN
                         That's it -- outta the pool!

               The boy, choking with laughter, plunges his face into the 
               water again. Sarah enters and calls out over the din --

                                     SARAH
                         Where're the girls? I thought you 
                         were tucking them in!

                                     JOHN
                         We got a volunteer!

               Sarah, smiling curiously, heads to the back stairwell.

               She sees Wills standing there. Watching the kids, his eyes 
               are filled with the same sort of wistful yearning that she 
               noticed at the toy store --

               She gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach as she 
               passes by and disappears upstairs.

               Finally, the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his 
               soaked head to the cheers of his friends.

               Then he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big bites 
               out of it until he uncovers a SILVER DOLLAR.

               Wills laughs at the kids' excitement. A moment later a WOMAN'S 
               GLOVED HANDS cover his eyes.

                                     WOMAN
                         Guess who?

               Wills feels her LONG GLOVES.

                                     WILLS
                         Wonder Woman?

                                     WOMAN
                         No.

                                     WILLS
                         Batgirl?

                                     WOMAN
                         I'll give you a hint. You dumped me.

                                     WILLS
                         Princess Di?

               She laughs and playfully strangles him.

                                     WILLS
                         Wendy?

               He turns and sees that it's the woman from the film's opening, 
               dressed as HOLLY GOLIGHTLY.

                                     WILLS
                         Yup, I'd know that throttle anywhere!

               INT. BROOKLYN SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY -- SAME

               Sarah stops silently at an AJAR DOOR and looks inside. 
               Charlotte sits on a bed between the twin girls who are nestled 
               up against her --

                                     MOLLY
                         Just one more.

                                     CARLA
                         Please?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         All right, but this is the last last 
                         one!

               She clears her throat and settles herself. The twins listen 
               with rapt attention as she recites from memory, slowly as 
               though it were a suspenseful bedtime story --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         "Because I could not stop for Death, 
                         He kindly stopped for me; 
                         The carriage held but just ourselves 
                         And Immortality. 
                         We slowly drove, he knew no haste, 
                         And I had put away 
                         My labor, and my leisure too, 
                         For his civility."

               Charlotte looks up and sees Sarah, who face is beaming with 
               affection. They share a smile and Charlotte keeps reciting --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         "We passed the school where children 
                         played 
                         At wrestling in a ring; 
                         We passed the fields of grazing grain, 
                         We passed the setting sun."

               Sarah eases the door shut and steps away.

               INT. BROOKLYN LIVING ROOM -- HOUR LATER

               THE CAMERA makes a CIRCUIT of the THINNING CROWD. Sarah blows 
               out candles, dumps ash trays, and collects empties.

               Charlotte, rubbing a knuckle into her sleepy eye, descends 
               the stairs. She sees Celia talking to Jesus, and walks over 
               to them --

                                     CELIA
                         Sweet dreams?

                         I had no idea I was so tired.

                              (from across the room)
                         They're down?

                         And out.
                              (looking around)
                         Where's Lucifer?

                              (jokingly)
                         Last time I saw him, he was in the 
                         kitchen going pretty heavily with 
                         Holly Golightly.

                                     CELIA
                         Hey, no gossip! Holly's a valued 
                         customer.

               Charlotte pretends to be fighting mad --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Lemme at 'er!

                                     JESUS
                         Hell hath no fury like a recluse 
                         scorned.

               Charlotte laughs and heads to the kitchen.

               John wipes down the table which is littered with bits of 
               apple.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hey, shouldn't one of your minions 
                         be doing that?

                                     JOHN
                         You know, in my day, you bobbed for 
                         the apple, and, sure, maybe there 
                         was a nickel inside it and that was 
                         sweet -- but you ate the god damn 
                         apple! These little animals grab the 
                         coin and they're out the door!

                                     JOHN
                         Exactly my point.

               They share a laugh.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Seen Beelzebub around?

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, he went upstairs.

               Charlotte is puzzled.

               INT. BROOKLYN SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY -- LATER

               Charlotte walks down the hall, opening doors and glancing 
               inside. She opens a bathroom and THREE CATS dash out.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Shit.

               She gets to the end of the hall and is about to give up. 
               When she hears FOOTSTEPS.

               She walks around the corner and sees a NARROW STAIRCASE 
               leading to the third floor.

               At the dark at the top of the stairs Wills and Wendy appear. 
               Charlotte smiles --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You lost your horns.

                         We were checking out the roof. John's 
                         got quite a set-up.

               They arrive at the bottom of the stairs.

                                     WILLS
                         Wendy, this is Charlotte Fielding. 
                         Charlotte -- my friend Wendy Lister.

               They smile and shake hands. Charlotte looks at them both 
               carefully for any sign of uneasiness. There is none.

                                     WENDY
                         Actually, I saw you at that memorial 
                         service in Connecticut. Your eulogy 
                         was beautiful.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thank you.

                         You guessed it.

               Wills smiles and rubs his hands together --

               Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each lost in 
               thought. The lights of the city illuminate their faces in 
               eerie flashes.

               Finally, Wills glances over and smiles --

                                     WILLS
                         I have a strange feeling that you're 
                         upset with me.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, I was just wondering if you had 
                         sex with that woman.

                                     WILLS
                         Ever?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, the answer to that's pretty 
                         obvious. I meant tonight. On the 
                         roof.

               Wills breaks into a grin --

                                     WILLS
                         You're not serious.

               Wills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the 
               reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror. 
               Wills smiles back at Charlotte --

                                     WILLS
                         Of course not. Why would I want to 
                         do something like that?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's what I was wondering. I 
                         thought, "We're so happy he'd have 
                         no reason to do it. And if he did do 
                         it, he'd at least look guilty, 
                         wouldn't he? But he doesn't. He looks 
                         more relaxed than before the party 
                         started."

                                     WILLS
                         Well, there you have it.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But then I thought, "He's a womanizer -- 
                         that's what they say." Funny word, 
                         huh? Sounds like some sorta machine. 
                         "And how do you get to be a womanizer? 
                         Obviously by sleeping with lots of 
                         different women for no good reason 
                         and being really good at lying about 
                         it."

                                     WILLS
                         Sure, except that --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Let me finish.

               Again, Wills looks up at the driver's eyes in the mirror. 
               They seem more serious now.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Anyway, there's something about being 
                         sick right here --

               She touches her own chest. Her voice trembles slightly --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         -- that has made me acutely aware of 
                         my heart. Nothing corny -- I mean, 
                         literally... I feel every beat. I 
                         know how sensitive it is. It reacts 
                         to everything.

               She turns in her seat and lifts an OPEN PALM.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         If you're lying to me, I'll know it.
                              (beat)
                         Did you have sex with Wendy on the 
                         roof?

               He smiles at her as though he were indulging a child. She 
               looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt.

               She slips her palm inside, over his heart.

               Still smiling, he doesn't move a muscle.

               Their eyes are locked.

               Ever so slowly, her face crumples and tears appear in her 
               eyes. She shakes her head --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         My God... oh my God.

               She slides away from him, drops her face into her hands, and 
               begins to cry. Wills looks down, then glances up at the 
               rearview mirror.

               Illuminated in flashes, the driver's eyes have taken on an 
               ominous, unblinking quality as though they were the outward 
               embodiment of his own conscience.

               Wills looks out the window. When he finally speaks, his voice 
               is calm and a little cold --

                                     WILLS
                         Look, I never pretended to be anything 
                         other than --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (a piteous cry)
                         You hate yourself so much!

               Wills is stunned. He looks out the window, speechless, his 
               eyes small and frightened.

               EXT. CHARLOTTE'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT

               The town car is stopped at the curb, motor running, lights 
               on.

               INT. TOWN CAR -- SAME

               Charlotte and Wills sit in silence --

                                     WILLS
                         This was all a mistake. Right from 
                         the start. All of it. I'm a grown 
                         man and you're a child.
                              (beat)
                         Anyway, you have better things to do 
                         with your last -- With your time 
                         than spend it with me.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (distantly)
                         What about you? Do you have anything 
                         better?

               Wills has no answer. Charlotte slowly gets out of the car. 
               She leans back in, her eyes narrow with disdain --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You know, maybe you're right. Maybe 
                         this is the best time to end it. 
                         Because I was actually starting to 
                         love you, Wills, and that's the last 
                         thing I ever wanted.

               She shuts the door.

               INT. BROWNSTONE FOYER -- NIGHT

               As Charlotte enters, we hear Wills' cab pull away. She moves 
               to the stairs and sees a LIGHT shining beneath the living 
               room door.

               INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- SAME

               Dolores sits watching an old movie, her eyes dulled by a 
               cataract of boozy fatigue. The door opens. She looks up and 
               sees Charlotte in costume.

                                     DOLLY
                         Well, if it ain't the Belle of 
                         Amherst.

               Charlotte smiles feebly and plops down on the cracked leather 
               ottoman. She looks blankly at the TV. She sniffles and wipes 
               a hand across her nose. Dolores glances over, then back at 
               the set.

                                     DOLLY
                         Seen that face before.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You have?

                                     DOLLY
                         And for the same god damn reason.

               Charlotte is confused, but then puts it together --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But you said Wills and my Mom were 
                         just friends.

                                     DOLLY
                         Sure, but she was nuts about him. 
                         The only reason she didn't sleep 
                         with him is 'cause she was 
                         sentimental. And smart. She wanted a 
                         ring first.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why didn't he give her one?

                                     DOLLY
                         'Cause he knocked up little Millie 
                         Tyler instead. In Newport. At Bailey's 
                         Beach. During the Labor Day clam 
                         bake.

               She chuckles grimly, coughs, and sips her drink.

                                     DOLLY
                         Millie was your mom's best friend 
                         from Nightingale. You had to hand it 
                         to him. He sure knew how to make a 
                         point.

               She coughs again. Charlotte struggles to make sense of it 
               all.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why did he do that?

                                     DOLLY
                         Aw, who the hell knows? 'Cause the 
                         moon was full. 'Cause life's short. 
                         'Cause he's Wills Keane. I'll tell 
                         you a little secret -- after that, 
                         your Mom hated his guts, but your 
                         dad never made her smile like he 
                         did.
                              (pause)
                         'Course your dad never made her cry 
                         like that either.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (softly)
                         Why didn't you tell me any of this 
                         before?

                                     DOLLY
                         Oh, I dunno...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You never talk to me! You never try 
                         to help me!

               Dolores' eyes grow nervous. She swallows hard.

                                     DOLLY
                         Christ, look at me. I'm gonna tell 
                         you what to do?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yes! You're my family. You're supposed 
                         to take care of me.

                                     DOLLY
                         Aw, you wouldn't listen. That's the 
                         thing about people -- they just do 
                         what they want from the day they're 
                         born till the day they die.

               She realizes her poor choice of words. She looks over and 
               their eyes collide. Charlotte begins to cry --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, that's you, Dolly! People who 
                         have given up don't listen to other 
                         people! People who want to die close 
                         off! That's not me! I wanted your 
                         help! I wanted to learn!

               Charlotte drops her head dejectedly.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Anything... anything you would ever 
                         have told me, I would have listened 
                         to! I promise.

                                     DOLLY
                              (fighting tears)
                         Aw, come on, honey. I can throw a 
                         party and I can mix a gimlet. After 
                         that, what the fuck do I know?

               She rises, gives Charlotte a nervous, awkward pat on the 
               shoulder, then crosses over to the bar.

               INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Wills stands in the center of the room, looking around 
               blankly. He disappears into the bedroom.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Wills enters and sees some of Charlotte's clothes folded 
               neatly on the bed. A LITERARY ANTHOLOGY lies open, showing a 
               DRAWING OF EMILY DICKINSON.

               He grabs the clothes and the book and puts them in a SHOPPING 
               BAG that she has left on the floor.

               Then he walks into the bathroom. We see him gathering BEAUTY 
               PRODUCTS off the sink. He walks back in and sets them into 
               the shopping bag.

               He looks around and spots a nearly completed crossword puzzle 
               sitting folded on the dresser. He drops that in the shopping 
               bag, too, then sets it by the door.

               He feels a draft and spots an OPEN WINDOW. As he crosses to 
               it, he notices something on his pillow. A blank ENVELOPE. He 
               picks it up and rips it open.

               It's a HALLOWEEN CARD of a grinning JACK-O-LANTERN. He opens 
               it and inside is handwritten:

               The scariest night of the year and only one thing haunts me: 
               that we might never have met.

               All my love, 
               XXX Charlotte.

               Wills lowers the card and heaves a deep breath. His jaw tight, 
               he walks over and drops the card into the shopping bag.

               INT. BROWNSTONE FOYER -- SAME

               Charlotte emerges from the living room and shuts the door 
               behind her. She climbs the stairs to her solitary bedroom.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- NIGHT

               From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI CAB breaks free and 
               glides to the curb in front of Elysium.

               Wills emerges with PATTY, 35, bosomy, bright-eyed, pitched a 
               little too loudly. Wills seems stiff and tentative, a shadow 
               of his former self.

               INT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS

               AN ELDERLY COUPLE passes them as they enter. Wills stops at 
               the coat check and helps Patty with her coat. She admires 
               the decor --

                                     PATTY
                         Oh, Wills, it's beautiful!

               Although his spirits are low, he is effortlessly cordial --

                                     WILLS
                         Thank you. It was designed by a team 
                         from --

                                     PATTY
                         So functional! Is that stainless 
                         steel?

                                     WILLS
                         Actually, no, it's velvet.

               She furrows her brow, squints, then laughs.

                                     PATTY
                         Oh, my God, it is!

               Wills hands Patty's coat to Melissa, the hat check girl, and 
               asks under his breath --

                                     WILLS
                         How are you?

               Looking at Patty, Melissa asks with deep sympathy --

                                     MELISSA
                         How are you, sir?

               Before Wills can respond, Patty takes his arm --

                                     PATTY
                         Well, if the food's even half as 
                         good as the moldings I'm in for a 
                         very special treat.

               Jesus is surprised to see that Wills is not with Charlotte --

                                     JESUS
                         Uhhh, good evening, Mr. Keane. Will 
                         you be dining with us?

                                     WILLS
                         Yes, Jesus. Table seven, if it's 
                         available.

                                     JESUS
                         Certainly, sir.

               Celia approaches, equally surprised not to see Charlotte --

                                     WILLS
                         Hello, Celia.

                                     CELIA
                              (sincerely)
                         How are you this evening, sir?

                                     WILLS
                         I've been worse.

                                     CELIA
                              (under her breath)
                         Are you sure?

               The NEW HOSTESS, Celia's replacement, arrives.

                                     JESUS
                         Table Seven.

                                     NEW HOSTESS
                         This way, please.

                                     WILLS
                              (to Patty)
                         Order a drink. I'll be right with 
                         you.

               Patty follows Celia. Wills moves to the reservation stand 
               where John stands, stone-faced, flipping through the 
               reservation book --

                                     JOHN
                         Where the hell you been?

                                     WILLS
                         Splendid, how are you?

                                     JOHN
                         Where's Charlotte?

                                     WILLS
                         Deliveries on time?

                                     JOHN
                         Who's the broad? She looks like a 
                         Holiday-Inn hooker from Ohio.

                                     WILLS
                         Keep up the good work!

               Wills walks away.

               INT. DOWNTOWN BAR -- NIGHT

               Dark, smoky, and boisterous. FIND CHARLOTTE, standing with 
               Simon. She looks around disgustedly and shouts above the 
               roar --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Okay, I'm chugging Scotch, gagging 
                         on smoke, and losing my hearing! Now 
                         why is this so good for me again?!

                                     SIMON
                         That's just it! The great spiritual 
                         benefit in leaving one's room is 
                         that it reminds one of how odious it 
                         is to leave one's room!

               ACROSS THE ROOM

               FOLLOW SHANNON, coming out of the ladies' room. She makes 
               her way through the crowd--

                                     SHANNON
                         Excuse me! Excuse me! Sorry! Excuse 
                         me!

                                     BOY'S VOICE
                         No problem!

               She looks up and can't believe her eyes.

               BACK TO CHARLOTTE AND SIMON

               Simon, shouting above the music, speaks with difficulty --

                                     SIMON
                         There's one thing you don't know 
                         about Mr. Keane and his adultery and 
                         as painful as it is I feel that I 
                         should tell you!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (alarmed)
                         What? What is it!

                                     SIMON
                         That woman on the roof? That was no 
                         ex-girlfriend! In fact, no woman at 
                         all. It was I, Simon Loring, master 
                         of disguise! Willsy and I have moved 
                         in together!

               Charlotte laughs and slaps him. Shannon approaches hauling 
               by the hand ERIC BALES, 24, small, beautiful, long-haired, 
               glasses.

                                     SHANNON
                         Look what I found!

               Charlotte can't believe it either --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Eric! Wow!

                                     ERIC
                         Hey, Char!

               They hug and kiss with some slight awkwardness, then shout 
               above the music --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         God, long time no see! One night we 
                         show up to rent Eraserhead and you're 
                         just gone!

                                     ERIC
                         Sorry about that!

                                     SHANNON
                         It was such a drag! You know, having 
                         to actually start paying to rent 
                         movies!

                                     ERIC
                         I bet!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What's up? Ralph said you moved to 
                         Rockland County!

                                     ERIC
                         Yeah, I got a job working for my 
                         mom's new boyfriend!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What does he do?

                                     ERIC
                         He sells pot!

                                     SHANNON
                         Cool!

                                     ERIC
                         Not really. I was a driver! I got 
                         laid off when he got busted. He's 
                         awaiting trial!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         So what're you doing now?

                                     ERIC
                         Same thing pretty much. Only for 
                         Domino's!

               Charlotte laughs.

                                     SHANNON
                         Whoa, I don't believe it!
                              (to Eric)
                         She hasn't laughed in like a week!

               Eric smiles quizzically at Charlotte, wondering why.

               INT. ELYSIUM -- NIGHT

               Wills sits listening to Patty talk --

                                     PATTY
                         -- so everybody on the conference 
                         call starts introducing themselves. 
                         Ned Lewey, Paris Office. Takashi 
                         Matsuo, Tokyo Office. Whoever, the 
                         London Office. And then someone says, 
                         "Will the architect from the New 
                         York office please identify himself." 
                         And I pipe up and say, "Well, guys, 
                         I'm not a him or an architect. I'm 
                         Patty Strauss and I'm head of East 
                         Coast marketing." And there's like 
                         total silence. It was hysterical!

               Wills smiles feebly. He looks away and sees John holding the 
               TELEPHONE, urgently signaling to him. Alarmed, Wills jumps 
               up --

                                     WILLS
                         I'm sorry, would you excuse me?

                                     PATTY
                         Of course.

               AT THE RESERVATION STAND

               Wills, fearing the worst, hurries to John --

                                     WILLS
                         Who is it?

                                     JOHN
                         Nobody!

               John slams down the phone, grabs him by the arm, hauls him 
               through the reception area and out the door. Patty watches, 
               confused.

               EXT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS

               John walks quickly down the block, still hauling Wills --

                                     JOHN
                         Last time I checked I was your best 
                         friend!

                                     WILLS
                         So?

                                     JOHN
                         So after the party, no thank you! I 
                         call you three times -- no call back! 
                         And for six days you don't even eat 
                         at your own god damn restaurant! 
                         What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I 
                         was ready to call the morgue!

                                     WILLS
                         Relax, I'm alive.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, you sure don't look it!

               EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER

               John walks as quickly as he can with Wills struggling to 
               keep up --

                                     JOHN
                         I'll tell you why it's my concern! 
                         Because I had a god damn swimming 
                         pool! An ocean view! A fabulous lemon 
                         tree hangin' right over my Jacuzzi! 
                         And I gave it up for you, brother! 
                         Back to a life of concrete and dirt 
                         and sirens just so you could get 
                         your shit together!

               EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTES LATER

               John, walking a little more slowly now, cannot believe his 
               ears --

                                     JOHN
                         On my roof? You gotta be kiddin'! 
                         Not on my green chair! Tell me it 
                         wasn't on the green chair.

               Wills winces.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, great. Now how am I gonna clean 
                         that?

               EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER

               John walks slowly now, backward, listening to an anxious 
               Wills --

                                     WILLS
                         Look, it doesn't matter that she's 
                         sick -- she's still a kid and there's 
                         no way we should be together. It's 
                         unhealthy... it's... it's 
                         inappropriate...

                                     JOHN
                              (with disgust)
                         What the hell is that? Some sorta 
                         shrink talk?

                                     WILLS
                         Look, if she were just fun... just 
                         some sort of diversion... maybe I 
                         could justify it. But the worst part 
                         is that it's becoming more. Much 
                         more. It's embarrassing how much I 
                         like her. She gets to me. She affects 
                         me...

               He stops and leans back against a building. He looks around, 
               avoiding eye contact with John, as tears rise into his eyes.

                                     WILLS
                         And she's gonna be gone and... I'm 
                         not sure I can... I mean... I already 
                         think about her all the time...
                              (fighting tears)
                         Her smile kills me... and the 
                         thought... that it'll be gone... 
                         forever... that I'll never see her 
                         again... I don't know... I can't -- 
                         I don't think I'm that strong, Johnny. 
                         It's too much. I'd rather have it be 
                         over... over now. I'll start missing 
                         her now.

               Wills is still unable to look at him. John speaks softly --

                                     JOHN
                         Buddy, I hate to break it to you, 
                         but in the real world... where I 
                         live... there're only two kindsa 
                         love stories. Boy loses girl and 
                         girl loses boy. That's all there is. 
                         Somebody always gets left behind. 
                         You try to avoid that, you'll end up 
                         an old man toastin' yourself with 
                         egg nog in the mirror on Christmas 
                         Eve. You'll end up dying in your own 
                         arms.

               Wills lifts his frightened eyes. John pats him on the cheek.

               EXT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

               Wills stands with Patty in the driveway in front of the glass 
               lobby. He is distracted and terribly anxious. She looks as 
               though she expects, at the very least, a kiss --

                                     PATTY
                         Thank you so much. I had such a great 
                         time.

                                     WILLS
                         Good. I'm... I'm glad.

                                     PATTY
                         Didn't you?

                                     WILLS
                         Patty, I... I want to be honest with 
                         you... right now, from the start... 
                         so there's no room for 
                         misunderstanding. I didn't have a 
                         good time, but it's nothing personal. 
                         I just split up with someone and 
                         rather than admit to myself how much 
                         I miss her, I asked you out instead. 
                         And it's unfair. If I feel sad I 
                         should just feel sad and not try to 
                         use you... and your body... as some 
                         sort of painkiller, right?
                              (beat)
                         Anyway, I think you're a warm and 
                         engaging woman and I wish you all 
                         the best.

               Relieved to have unburdened himself of the truth, he shakes 
               her hand. Patty, utterly baffled, doesn't know what hit her.

               EXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- LATER

               The doorman Michael, smoking a cigarette, sees Wills walk 
               up, his expression pensive.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Mr. Keane --

                                     WILLS
                         Good night, Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You've got a visitor.

               Wills stops and turns --

                                     WILLS
                         Who?

                                     MICHAEL
                         She's been waitin' almost an hour. 
                         In the lobby.
                              (off Wills' look)
                         A little surprise for ya.

               He winks. Wills realizes that it's Charlotte. It must be. He 
               smiles and hurries inside.

               INT. WILLS' LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

               Wills bursts in and freezes. A WOMAN stands across the way, 
               studying an oil painting. She turns quickly. It's LISA. She 
               sees his excited expression fall. Beneath her rather composed 
               facade, Lisa is a chaos of conflicting emotions --

                                     LISA
                         Sorry to disappoint you.

                                     WILLS
                         No, no. Not at all. You surprised 
                         me, that's all. I didn't expect to 
                         see you... not here... not after 
                         your letter.

                                     LISA
                         Well, I didn't expect you to show up 
                         at my job.

                                     WILLS
                         I followed you in. I wasn't even 
                         sure it was you. All I have is an 
                         old snapshot.

                                     LISA
                         My boss thought you were a stalker.

                                     WILLS
                         I didn't mean to run off like that.

                                     LISA
                         But you did.

               An awkward silence.

                                     LISA
                         So you got my letter. What'd you do? 
                         Freak out? Burn it?

                                     WILLS
                         I saved it.

                                     LISA
                         I was just blowing off some steam, 
                         okay? I think I have the right.

                                     WILLS
                         So do I. Look, why don't we go 
                         upstairs.

                                     LISA
                              (uneasily)
                         No. I didn't plan to come. Peter... 
                         my husband... he agrees. He thinks 
                         it's a futile exercise. But it turns 
                         out I'm pregnant. Just a few months, 
                         but --

                                     WILLS
                         Lisa -- Congratulations. That's 
                         wonderful.

               His sincerity stops her. She softens slightly, mustering a 
               tiny smile --

                                     LISA
                         Thanks. Anyway, I guess it made me 
                         want to meet you. I've been a little 
                         sentimental about parent-hood.

                                     WILLS
                         Is that what you consider me?

                                     LISA
                         In a lousy absentee sorta way, sure.

               Pause.

                                     WILLS
                         How's your mom?

                                     LISA
                         Great. Nuts. She moved to Costa Rica 
                         last summer.

                                     WILLS
                         Why?

                                     LISA
                         A guy, what else? He owns a charter 
                         airline and wears sunglasses indoors. 
                         I think he might be a gunrunner.

               Wills chuckles. For the first time, Lisa relaxes enough to 
               take him in.

                                     LISA
                         You know, you're much better looking 
                         in person than in photographs. I 
                         always assumed Mom was exaggerating, 
                         but she wasn't.

                                     WILLS
                         Thanks. You're not bad looking 
                         yourself.

               Lisa smiles, and, much to her embarrassment, tears come to 
               her eyes. She shakes her head at how absurd she is, treasuring 
               kind words from a father she doesn't know.

                                     LISA
                         Anyway... I should go...

                                     WILLS
                         Already?

                                     LISA
                         I really just wanted to meet you 
                         and... maybe... I don't know...

                                     WILLS
                              (gently)
                         What is it? Tell me.

               She sniffles and looks away --

                                     LISA
                         Nothing earth-shattering. Maybe just 
                         to hear you say you were sorry.

               Silence.

                                     WILLS
                         I am. I'm very sorry.

               She stares at him long and hard, waiting for some more 
               palpable sign of remorse. It isn't forthcoming. Finally, she 
               nods.

                                     LISA
                         Okay. Thanks.

               She turns and walks away. His voice stops her --

                                     WILLS
                         Can I call you?

               She turns around, hesitates for a moment, then nods. She 
               continues to the door. But then she stops and turns --

                                     LISA
                         Before... when you came in... who 
                         did you think I was?

                                     WILLS
                         A friend.

                                     LISA
                         You must like her an awful lot.

               She smiles simply and heads for the door. When she is gone, 
               Wells slowly walks back toward the elevators, but then 
               abruptly stops in his tracks, deliberating...

               EXT. VILLAGE -- DAWN

               THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN SLOWLY from a view of the sun rising 
               in the EASTERN SKY to a TAXI gliding over to the curb in 
               front of...

               CHARLOTTE'S BROWNSTONE -- DAWN

               Charlotte, looking tired and a little pale, pays the driver 
               and emerges from the taxi. She makes her way up the steps.

               INT. BROWNSTONE -- CONTINUOUS

               Looking down from the second-floor landing, we see Charlotte 
               enter and walk up the stairs toward us.

               As she reaches the landing, she feels a STABBING PAIN IN HER 
               CHEST and stops walking. Wincing, she waits for the pain to 
               subside.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Charlotte enters wearily, drops her purse on the floor, then 
               turns and GASPS.

               Wills lies sprawled in an armchair fully dressed, sound 
               asleep.

               Charlotte is offended by the intrusion. She hurries over to 
               awaken him. But then she stops. Her face softens slightly.

               She studies his face... touches his cheek with the back of 
               her hand... traces the lines at his eyes with a fingertip.. 
               smooths back a wisp of hair.

               Finally, snapping to, steeling herself, she jostles him --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hey.

               Wills wakes with a violent start. When he sees her, he drops 
               his head back. He closes his eyes again and murmurs sleepily --

                                     WILLS
                         Where were you? I was worried.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         So worried you fell asleep. What're 
                         you doing here?

                                     WILLS
                         I've missed you. You have no idea 
                         how much.

               She crosses coldly to her closet and, half-shutting the door, 
               blocking his view, starts to undress.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How'd you get in?

               He sits up, rubbing his eyes in the morning light.

                                     WILLS
                         Dolly. We watched TV. She fell asleep. 
                         What time is it?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I didn't know I had a curfew.

                                     WILLS
                         Where were you?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         None of your business. So what is 
                         it? What do you want?

               Wills sits forward, more alert now. He exhales heavily and 
               begins:

                                     WILLS
                         To tell you that you were right. I 
                         do hate myself. But not so much that 
                         I can't see how stupid and despicable 
                         and --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Cowardly.

                                     WILLS
                         And cowardly what I did was. And 
                         even though there's no excuse for 
                         it, I want you to forgive me.

               She turns and looks at him. She feels herself relenting. She 
               turns away and continues undressing --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why should I?

                                     WILLS
                         Because, for better or worse, I'm 
                         falling in love with you, and the 
                         thought of our not being together is 
                         unbearable to me.

               She stops, then glances at him with a flash of pain and 
               longing. Determined not to surrender to her feelings, she 
               crosses to the bed and throws open the covers.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Let's sleep.

               She crawls into bed.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         In the morning, we'll talk about 
                         what a gigantic asshole you are.

               Wills, relieved, crosses to the bed and begins to undress. 
               He asks casually --

                                     WILLS
                         So where were you?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         With Shannon and Simon and Eric.

                                     WILLS
                         Who's Eric?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         An old friend who used to work at 
                         Blockbuster.

                                     WILLS
                         What'd you guys do?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Talked and drank. Simon and Shannon 
                         finally went home. Eric and I hung 
                         out.

               Thinking nothing of it, Wills nods. He slips into bed. Her 
               back is to him. He drapes an arm around her and pulls her a 
               little closer.

               He smiles contentedly and closes his eyes. But then something 
               occurs to him. He opens his eyes --

                                     WILLS
                         Hung out where?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Stop. We'll talk about it tomorrow.

                                     WILLS
                         Fine.

               He closes his eyes again. A few beats later, they open.

                                     WILLS
                         Talk about what? Is there something 
                         to talk about? What happened?

               Charlotte, eyes still closed, breaks into a sly, amused smile.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST -- DAY

               Wills and Charlotte, collars turned up against the brisk 
               wind, walk together. Charlotte wears a backpack. Wills tries 
               desperately to appear casual --

                                     WILLS
                         No, honestly, I think I have a right 
                         to know.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         And I honestly think I have a right 
                         not to tell you.

                                     WILLS
                         You're being unreasonable.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You're being nosy.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY

               They move down a winding walkway beneath barren trees --

                                     WILLS
                         You know, in this day and age it's 
                         not so outrageous a request. I mean, 
                         I don't know this kid. I don't know 
                         where he's been.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (laughing incredulously)
                         You're worried about where he's been? 
                         Give me a break!

               EXT. WOLLMAN RINK -- DAY

               Wills watches as Charlotte laces up her figure skates --

                                     WILLS
                         It requires balance and I have lousy 
                         balance, okay?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, come on, what's the worst that 
                         can happen?
                              (beat)
                         Well, I guess you could break a hip.

                                     WILLS
                         Look, I'm not in a sporting mood!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How come?

                                     WILLS
                         I'm jealous, okay?! Is that what you 
                         want to hear? Are you satisfied now?

               She burst out laughing --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Not even close!

               EXT. WOLLMAN RINK -- DAY

               Wills paces the bleachers, furious, while Charlotte skates 
               nearby --

                                     WILLS
                         All I want is a simple answer and 
                         you're torturing me! And I resent 
                         it! It's cruel and juvenile! And I --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (exploding)
                         HEY!

               Her anger startles him. She skates over quickly and skids to 
               an abrupt stop --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's not! It's adult! It's revenge! 
                         And if you think it's bad not knowing 
                         what I did -- well, it's even worse 
                         knowing exactly what you did!

               She turns and skates away.

               EXT. WOLLMAN RINK -- AFTERNOON

               Wills sits on the bleachers, miserably brooding, while 
               Charlotte gracefully glides by, laughing and chatting with 
               THREE YOUNG MALE SKATERS whom she's just met.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- NIGHTFALL

               They walk together in silence. Wills is sullen. Finally, 
               Charlotte takes his hand and speaks gently but firmly --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do me a favor, okay? Never ask me 
                         again what happened with Eric. Just 
                         accept the fact that you'll never, 
                         ever know. And if that hurts, then 
                         think about it next time you want to 
                         cheat on somebody.

               Wills reflects.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Charlotte and Wills are little more than silhouettes, lying 
               entwined in the rich darkness, conversing in whispers:

                                     WILLS
                         I wish I were exaggerating, but I'm 
                         not. I slept with every one of them. 
                         Really. Look through Dolly's old 
                         photo albums... or any movie 
                         magazine... visit Aspen at Christmas. 
                         I was on a mission. And until recently 
                         I really didn't think I had a problem. 
                         Or if I did, it was definitely the 
                         most pleasurable one I could imagine.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What changed?

                                     WILLS
                         My house in Malibu burned to the 
                         ground.

               Charlotte laughs. Wills smiles with sad irony.

                                     WILLS
                         I know, it sounds funny. But it must 
                         have triggered something because the 
                         next thing I knew I couldn't sleep. 
                         I'd lie awake at night absolutely 
                         terrified. Like a kid left alone in 
                         the dark.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What were you scared of?

                                     WILLS
                         How quickly time was passing and how 
                         adolescent I still felt. How 
                         meaningless all my choices seemed. 
                         How lonely I was. So I liquidated my 
                         portfolio, sold my businesses, and 
                         moved back here. To start over, settle 
                         down, start acting my age.
                              (beat)
                         You were supposed to be my one last 
                         dalliance with youth.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, for your sake, I hope I am.

               He thinks for a moment, then smiles, and kisses her brow.

               INT. MACDONALD'S -- DAY

               Wills sits with John, Sarah, and the twins at a plastic table 
               overrun with food, wrappers, and squashed condiment tubes. 
               Sarah speaks to Wills --

                                     SARAH
                         Judge you? Why would I? Screw the 
                         age difference -- I like the new 
                         you! Before Charlotte came along, do 
                         you have any idea how hard it was to 
                         get you to sit down for a Happy Meal?

               Wills and John laugh. Molly, one of the twins, chimes in --

                                     MOLLY
                         Uncle Wills, how come you don't get 
                         married?

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, how come, Uncle Wills?

                                     WILLS
                         I want to, Carla, but --

                                     MOLLY
                         I'm not Carla! I'm Molly!

                                     WILLS
                         Well, Molly, I just haven't met the 
                         right woman yet.

                                     CARLA
                         What about Charlotte? She's funny-
                         pretty.

                                     SARAH
                              (aside to Wills)
                         It means funny and pretty. It's their 
                         highest compliment.

                                     WILLS
                         I agree.
                              (rising from the table)
                         She's also demanding.

                                     JOHN
                         Where're you goin'?

                                     WILLS
                         She's decided she wants her birthday 
                         present today.

               Wills gives both of the little girls hugs and kisses.

                                     JOHN
                         But that was last month.

                                     WILLS
                         The Dom didn't count. This is her 
                         real present. She chose it herself 
                         and it's not material.

                                     JOHN
                         Now you got me curious.

                                     SARAH
                         Yeah, what is it?

               Wills shakes his head and smiles, reluctant to answer.

               From the next scene we hear the sound of TWO DOZEN PEOPLE 
               BREATHING FURIOUSLY.

               INT. STUDIO -- AFTERNOON

               On a slightly elevated stage, HARI SINGH, 35, an American 
               Sikh wearing a white robe and turban, sits in the lotus 
               position before a lighted candle, softly instructing the 
               crowded class --

                                     HARI
                         Okay... breath of fire... now inhale 
                         deeply... hold the breath... let 
                         your heart lotus blossom... feel the 
                         energy rise... and exhale. Good. Now 
                         peacock pose.

               Hari rolls forward, digs his elbows into his midsection, and 
               pops up so that he is parallel to the floor with his legs 
               still crossed.

               ANGLE ON THE CLASS, all moving into the pose. In the center 
               of the class are Wills and Charlotte, wearing sweats. His 
               arms shaking, Wills is clearly in pain. He mutters --

                                     WILLS
                         When does the enlightenment start?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         When you realize that I'm God.

               Wills laughs. A moment later, Charlotte winces and falls out 
               of the pose onto the mat. Hari looks over, confused --

                                     HARI
                         Are you all right?

               Charlotte sits up quickly, smiling --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah. No big deal. Cramp in the old 
                         fifth shakra!

               She glances over at Wills. He sees that she's scared to death. 
               He helps her to her feet, speaking softly in her ear --

                                     WILLS
                         Don't worry. You're gonna be okay.

               She nods. They move toward the door. But after a few steps, 
               her eyes flutter, her body goes limp, and she slams down on 
               the mat, UNCONSCIOUS.

               INT. SPEEDING AMBULANCE -- AFTERNOON

               Charlotte lies on a stretcher near Wills and a PARAMEDIC --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's no big deal. I just 
                         hyperventilated. Really.

               But then she gasps as she's hit by a stab of pain. Wills 
               throws a grave look at the medic and squeezes her hand more 
               tightly.

               EXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT

               The building is brightly illuminated against the night sky.

               INT. ST. VINCENT'S WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Wills sits, anxiously struggling with a half-finished 
               crossword puzzle. He hears the click of a lighter. A GRUBBY 
               LITTLE MAN standing by the coffee machine lights a generic 
               cigarette.

                                     WILLS
                         Excuse me... do you have an extra 
                         one of those?

                                     LITTLE MAN
                              (eyes narrowing)
                         You a smoker?

                                     WILLS
                         Not for years.

                                     LITTLE MAN
                         Well, hell, if I'm gonna be the one 
                         to get you goin' again.

               Pause.

                                     WILLS
                         Thanks.

                                     LITTLE MAN
                         Don't mention it.

               Wills looks up and sees Dr. Sibley standing in the doorway.

               INT. TELEMETRY FLOOR CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

               Sibley walks Wills down the hallway --

                                     SIBLEY
                         The repeat MRI and CAT scan do show 
                         interval progression.

                                     WILLS
                              (uncertainly)
                         Which means the tumor's grown?

                                     SIBLEY
                         Yes. Yes, it has. Considerably. As 
                         for her loss of consciousness, one 
                         explanation is a disturbance in her 
                         heart's electrical function. We'll 
                         be monitoring her overnight for any 
                         arrhythmias. If we find something, 
                         we'll treat it. Unfortunately, the 
                         more likely explanation is that the 
                         tumor has begun to obstruct the 
                         outflow of her heart. If that's the 
                         case, there's little we can do. We 
                         could be speaking in terms of weeks 
                         not months.

               They arrive at Charlotte's room.

                                     SIBLEY
                         When she returns home, we'll want 
                         her to stay active, but don't let 
                         her overexert herself.
                              (off Wills' nod)
                         Don't stay long. She's been sedated.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- SAME

               Charlotte lies in the bed with her eyes closed. An EKG monitor 
               bleeps steadily in the corner. An IV drip hangs by her bed.

               Wills enters and sits down at her bedside. He touches her 
               hand. She opens her eyes and smiles drowsily --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hey.

               Wills is terribly anxious. His speech is accelerated

                                     WILLS
                         Are you all right? You're okay? How 
                         do you feel?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Stoned.

                                     WILLS
                         I'll let you rest. I should. You'll 
                         sleep and then --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (touching his hand)
                         Shhh.

               He nods and inhales deeply. His heart is racing. She murmurs --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You still owe me a birthday present.

                                     WILLS
                         I do not.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Just 'cause I fainted is no excuse 
                         for you to bail on your peacock pose.

               She smiles sleepily. Wills lifts a hand to her mouth and 
               whispers:

                                     WILLS
                         It ought to be illegal.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What?

                                     WILLS
                         Your smile. It's too pretty.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I've ruined you for other women.

                                     WILLS
                         You have.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         All part of my master plan.
                              (beat)
                         Do you wanna hear a story... a bedtime 
                         story?

                                     WILLS
                         Shouldn't I be telling you one?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Once upon a time, there was a woman 
                         on a ship crossing the Atlantic and 
                         her little boy got sick. Very sick. 
                         And she said whoever saves my boy's 
                         life... I'll name my next baby after 
                         them. Well, they got into port and 
                         they rushed her son to St. Vincent's 
                         hospital... to here... and they saved 
                         his life. And so the mother named 
                         her next baby Edna St. Vincent Millay.
                              (beat)
                         And Edna grew up to be, as I am sure 
                         you know, the second greatest female 
                         poet in American history.

                                     WILLS
                         The first would be Emily Dickinson.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You're a quick learner -- I like 
                         that about you...
                              (half to herself)
                         "It may be, when my heart is dull, 
                         Having attained its girth, 
                         I shall not find so beautiful 
                         The meagre shapes of earth, 
                         Nor linger in the rain to mark 
                         The small of tansy through the dark."

               Her eyes drift shut --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I am so pretentious...

               Wills laughs, then clears his throat, and looks suddenly 
               serious --

                                     WILLS
                         Charlotte, listen, I --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh-oh. Heavy, heavy...

                                     WILLS
                         I just think --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No. No violins. I'm fine. Go home... 
                         sleep...

               He considers for a moment, then, tears welling in his eyes, 
               he lifts her hand to his mouth and kisses it.

               INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

               Wills sits across from Simon who strokes Shannon's back as 
               she weeps --

                                     SHANNON
                         It just didn't seem real and now 
                         that it is, I hate it! It's so unfair!

               Dolores, sitting in her armchair, mutters as though by rote --

                                     DOLLY
                         Fare is what you pay on the train to 
                         Jersey. Fair is the place that smells 
                         like manure where, if you're real 
                         lucky, you win a blue ribbon for 
                         your home-made pickles. Fair is a 
                         sky without a cloud and a face with 
                         a mark. Fare is food. What fair isn't 
                         is everything else.

                                     SIMON
                         Well, I think I speak for all of us 
                         when I say that we've heard quite 
                         enough from Dolores.

               Dolores chuckles. Simon continues to Wills --

                                     SIMON
                         Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I 
                         believe what you're saying is that 
                         while the end may be in sight, it 
                         has not yet arrived.

                                     WILLS
                         That's right. The tumor's begun to 
                         interfere with the function of her 
                         heart, but she --

                                     SIMON
                         Then why exactly have you called us 
                         here?

               Wills falters, looking at him incredulously.

                                     SIMON
                         I cut short a lunch date, Shannon's 
                         missing her low-impact aerobics class, 
                         and Dolores has delayed the start of 
                         her happy hour -- surely you must 
                         have had good reason.

                                     WILLS
                         I thought Charlotte's health might 
                         be of some interest you.

                                     SIMON
                         It is. You could have told me all 
                         about it on the telephone.

                                     WILLS
                         I also thought it might be a good 
                         idea if we discussed ways to make 
                         her as comfortable as possible for 
                         the --

                                     SIMON
                         Charlotte loathes comfortable. I 
                         never sought to bore her with comfort 
                         while she was well, why should I 
                         start now that she's sick?

               Wills stares at Simon, his face ashen and full of contempt --

                                     WILLS
                         Tell me, are you really so cold? Or 
                         is it just a pose that you've 
                         cultivated?

                                     SIMON
                         It's a pose that I've cultivated.
                              (beat)
                         I chose it, as a sort of smoke screen, 
                         some time after attending my twentieth 
                         funeral in as many months.

               Pause.

                                     WILLS
                         I'm sorry.

                                     SIMON
                         It's quite all right. But, honestly, 
                         it shocks me how often you people 
                         forget. Our phone books have as many 
                         numbers crossed out as written in. 
                         So that while death is certainly as 
                         painful to us as it is to you, we do 
                         not find it nearly so... 
                         extraordinary.
                              (beat)
                         Don't misunderstand me. I adore 
                         Charlotte and when she dies, I 
                         would... were it not already in that 
                         state... cry my heart dry.

               Shannon looks at Simon and burst into tears again. Simon 
               holds her even closer, rubbing her back.

               MUSIC UP:

               EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHTFALL

               Wills emerges from Charlotte's brownstone, hails a cab, then 
               decides against it.

               EXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHTFALL

               Head down, eyes desolate, Wills walks uptown. The roaring 
               traffic, dense crowds, blaring music, flashing neon -- the 
               great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him.

               He can think only of Charlotte.

               EXT. HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

               Wills walks down a dark block, his jacket open to the cold 
               night wind, his cheeks and ears burned red.

               INT. HELL'S KITCHEN WALK-UP FOYER -- NIGHT

               Wills enters, checks the tenant list, then presses a buzzer. 
               He speaks into the intercom and a moment later is buzzed up.

               INT. WALK-UP STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

               FOLLOW WILLS, running up the stairs. He arrives at a door, 
               cold and gasping for breath. He hears footsteps.

               THE DOOR OPENS, but we do not see who is there.

               MUSIC OUT:

               INT. WALK-UP LIVING ROOM -- LATER

               Wills paces, speaking desperately to someone. He seems on 
               the verge of a total nervous collapse --

                                     WILLS
                         She's in the hospital now. She doesn't 
                         have long. Weeks maybe and -- She... 
                         Anyway, I have something to ask you. 
                         A favor. I have no right to ask. I 
                         know. I'd do it myself, but I can't. 
                         I'm too... I'm...

               He takes a deep breath to keep himself from crying.

               ANGLE ON LISA, his daughter, sitting on the couch, listening, 
               her face unreadable --

                                     LISA
                         What is it?

                                     WILLS
                         I want you to find a surgeon. Dr. 
                         Sibley told me... Charlotte's doctor 
                         told me... he said at some point, 
                         when it's hopeless, surgery could be 
                         an option. Heroic surgery, he called 
                         it. I want to make sure that when 
                         the time comes a hero is performing 
                         that heroic surgery. Do you 
                         understand? You'll have to make calls. 
                         I'll get names. Sibley will give me 
                         names.
                              (fighting tears)
                         I'm sorry to ask you... I have no 
                         right. But, you see, she doesn't 
                         want it... this surgery... I'll have 
                         to convince her. So no one can know... 
                         for now. And I trust you. You're my 
                         only family and I...
                              (beat)
                         You have every right to refuse me. 
                         After what I did. You were a child... 
                         and you needed me... and I was nowhere 
                         to be found. There's no excuse for 
                         that. I'm so terribly sorry!

               Silence.

                                     LISA
                         I'd be happy to do it.

               Wills, stunned, deeply grateful, allows himself a breath.

                                     LISA
                         Dad, I'm really sorry she's sick.

                                     WILLS
                              (almost inaudible)
                         I am, too. So sorry. I should be the 
                         one. It should be me.

               Lisa, flooded with compassion, wants to go to him, comfort 
               him, but she stays where she is.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. CARL SCHURZ PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON

               The darkening sky is swept with a brisk wintry breeze. Shadows 
               descend from the trees and towering rocks. AN OLD MAN sits 
               on a bench, reading a newspaper. A NANNY pushes a baby 
               carriage past.

               Wills and Charlotte walk together, bundled up again the cold. 
               Charlotte walks backward, her breath shooting out into the 
               cold air like smoke --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You never talk about my mother.
                              (beat)
                         Talk about her.

                                     WILLS
                         What do you want to know?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Everything. All I remember is that 
                         she smelled like vanilla, loved to 
                         read to me, and was really good at 
                         cutting up fruit. I couldn't believe 
                         she didn't cut her fingers off.

                                     WILLS
                         Well, I remember a little more than 
                         that. Let's see... she was blonde... 
                         about your height --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I've seen pictures, dummy.

                                     WILLS
                         Oh, okay. She... always ate her ice 
                         cream with a fork -- how's that?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Much better.

                                     WILLS
                         And she wrote great letters, but 
                         couldn't spell at all.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Neither can I.

                                     WILLS
                         She was a McGovern Democrat but also 
                         an incredible snob. She loved 
                         blueberries. She had the world's 
                         worst backhand. Her favorite singer 
                         was Stephen Stills.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Who?

                                     WILLS
                         Never mind. She was afraid of sharks. 
                         And, considering the times, she was 
                         pretty square. She only tried drugs 
                         once -- a lifeguard gave her a hash 
                         brownie and she threw it up all over 
                         him.

               Charlotte laughs.

                                     WILLS
                         And she laughed just like that. And 
                         she bit her fingernails. And she 
                         couldn't tell a joke.
                              (beat)
                         In short, she was a unique.

               Charlotte smiles happily.

               EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE -- MINUTES LATER

               Wills and Charlotte lean down on the railing, watching the 
               water purl and eddy around Randall's Island.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Did you know she was in love with 
                         you?

                                     WILLS
                         She told me.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Were you in love with her?

                                     WILLS
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why? Because she was the only girl 
                         in Rhode Island who wouldn't sleep 
                         with you?

                                     WILLS
                         That's how she got my attention; 
                         it's not why I fell in love with 
                         her.
                              (beat)
                         I fell in love with her because she 
                         charmed me senseless day and night 
                         for an entire summer.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Then why did you screw her best friend 
                         on Labor Day?

               Wills looks at her darkly. She smiles and shrugs --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's just a question.

               Wills sighs and looks away, reflecting --

                                     WILLS
                         I have no idea. The summer was over. 
                         Your mom was going back to Smith. I 
                         was moving down here to work on Wall 
                         Street. It was our last day together. 
                         She was crying. She told me, for the 
                         first time, that she loved me. I 
                         said I loved her, too. I promised to 
                         call and visit. A few hours later I 
                         was in a cabana with Millie.
                              (beat)
                         When Millie told me she was pregnant 
                         and that she wanted to marry me, I 
                         escaped to L.A... and I never saw 
                         her or your mom again.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (wryly)
                         Well done.

                                     WILLS
                         I think it's part of the reason I 
                         never came back.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But why're you like that? What is 
                         it? I mean, you weren't born that 
                         way.

                                     WILLS
                         I might as well have been. For as 
                         long as I can remember, I've always 
                         run off at the first sign of a woman 
                         wanting anything from me... relying 
                         on me in any way.

               She considers for a moment --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But I want everything from you, Wills. 
                         I rely on you in every way.

                                     WILLS
                         I know.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         So the only reason you don't dump me 
                         is because I'm sick? Because you 
                         know that it's all going to be over, 
                         anyway?

                                     WILLS
                         Maybe. But it doesn't feel that way.
                              (beat)
                         It feels as though I'm not afraid 
                         anymore.

               She looks at him and smiles. He puts an arm around her and 
               draws her close.

               INT. TAXI -- AFTERNOON

               Wills looks out the window, his arm draped around Charlotte 
               who lies nestled against him, eyes closed.

               He suddenly sees something. He thinks. Checks his watch. His 
               eyes ignite and he calls out excitedly to the driver --

                                     WILLS
                         Driver! Quick! Pull over here! Right 
                         here!

               Charlotte, a little sleepy, comes to. She looks out the window 
               and her face softens with happiness.

               EXT. THE BRICK CHURCH, 92ND AND PARK -- SAME

               On the steps of the old church a CHOIR sings Christmas carols. 
               All around them, a LARGE CROWD sings along.

               Wills and Charlotte get out of the cab. His arm around her, 
               Wills pulls her into the crowd. They join the carol. Wills 
               sings well. Charlotte is tone deaf.

               In between lines of the song, she calls out --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I didn't know you could sing!

                                     WILLS
                         I didn't know you couldn't!

               She laughs and continues to sing.

               THE CAROLS ENDS to cheers and applause. THE CHOIRMASTER steps 
               forward to a microphone --

                                     CHOIRMASTER
                         Well, you all know what time it is!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (confused to Wills)
                         No, I don't. Do you?

               He grins. The choirmaster nods at someone in the distance. 
               Then holds up a hand, fingers spread, and begins to count 
               down. The crowd joins in --

                                     CHOIRMASTER AND CROWD
                         TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX, FIVE, 
                         FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE!

               At that instant, ALL THE WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS on the trees 
               of the median from 96th Street to 44th Street POP ON 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY -- an enchanted fairy-tale spectacle.

               The crowd and the choir cheer and clap, cars honk their horns. 
               Charlotte's eyes are filled with happy wonder.

                                     CHOIRMASTER
                         HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

               As another carol begins, Wills wraps his arms around Charlotte 
               and kisses her. He pulls away, looks deeply into her eyes, 
               and whispers with passionate sincerity --

                                     WILLS
                         I love you, Charlotte.

               For an instant, her eyes flare as though she were surprised. 
               Then her eyes fill with tears. She tries to speak but she is 
               choked by a sob.

               She buries her face in his chest and cries. Wills smiles 
               with warm, almost paternal, indulgence. He strokes her hair. 
               She hugs him as though she'll never let go.

               INT. ELYSIUM -- NIGHT

               The restaurant is packed. John, overwhelmed by the crowd 
               waiting for tables, glances angrily away when he hears the 
               phone ringing and no one answering it.

               INT. ELYSIUM KITCHEN -- SAME

               Amid the Pandemonium, Wills watches as Charlotte teases HENRY, 
               30, the young chef, as he lays the beet garnishes on a fish 
               entree.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You call that a rose? It looks more 
                         like a hand grenade!

                                     HENRY
                         Mr. Keane, you get her outta here 
                         or, I swear to God, I'm gonna 
                         butterfly and stuff her!

                                     WILLS
                         I'll add it to the specials list.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (laughing)
                         No way! I'm too pricey!

               The door bangs open. John enters, looking angry --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hello, Sunshine!

                                     JOHN
                         You seen Celia?

                                     WILLS
                         What's the matter?

                                     JOHN
                         The matter is I got a half-hour wait 
                         and no help up front! You got a call 
                         on Two!

               INT. ELYSIUM OFFICE -- SAME

               Wills enters, picks up the phone, and hits a flashing button--

                                     WILLS
                         Wills Keane.

               INT. LISA'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING

               Lisa's face is flushed with excitement --

                                     LISA
                         I've got him!

               EXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- MORNING

               A TOWN CAR is parked out front. Michael, the doorman, chats 
               with the driver.

                                     LISA (V.O.)
                         His name's Tom Grandy. Harvard 
                         undergrad. Columbia Medical School. 
                         He's at the Cleveland Clinic. I know, 
                         I know. But don't laugh. It's one of 
                         the best in the world.

               Wills exits the building and gets into the car.

               EXT. QUEENS -- MORNING

               The town car speeds down the expressway.

                                     LISA (V.O.)
                         He did his residency at the Brigham 
                         in Boston... his cardiac surgery 
                         training at Cleveland.

               EXT. LA GUARDIA AIRPORT -- MORNING

               Wills walks quickly through the terminal.

                                     LISA (V.O.)
                         He was so good they kept him on and 
                         within three years he was chief of 
                         the program.

               EXT. CLEVELAND CLINIC -- DAY

               Wills gets out of a taxi and heads inside --

                                     LISA (V.O.)
                         He travels a lot. Spends lots of 
                         time lecturing. I got you an 
                         appointment tomorrow at twelve-thirty. 
                         Don't be late. He only has fifteen 
                         minutes.

               INT. CLEVELAND CLINIC CORRIDOR -- DAY

               TOM GRANDY, 35, long-hair, small beard, loose-limbed, wearing 
               scrubs, saunters down the hall, wearing a vaguely goofy smile. 
               Wills watches him approach with some apprehension.

                                     LISA (V.O.)
                         The surgeon that recommended him 
                         said, and these are his words not 
                         mine, "Don't let his appearance fool 
                         you. He's brilliant and has balls 
                         the size of your head."

               INT. GRANDY'S OFFICE -- SAME

               Wills listens to Dr. Grandy who speaks casually, more like a 
               benign hippie than a renowned surgeon. Charlotte's X-rays 
               hang between them in an illuminated view box --

                                     GRANDY
                         Listen, I'm not gonna bullshit you. 
                         If she were a baby, she'd have a 
                         decent chance, 'cause these sorts of 
                         tumors can regress like crazy, but 
                         she's twenty and... I don't know, 
                         man... I've never seen anything like 
                         it.
                              (pointing at the X-
                              ray)
                         I mean, look! It's wrapped around 
                         her vital structures like an octopus!
                              (sitting)
                         You know, just once I'd like to get 
                         sent something simple. A "cabbage," 
                         a valve replacement. Even a good old-
                         fashioned transplant. But it doesn't 
                         happen anymore. It's the downside of 
                         being good at my job.

                                     WILLS
                         Good? They say there's no one better.

                                     GRANDY
                         I don't know. I'm like most people. 
                         I do the best I can.

                                     WILLS
                         Can your best save her?

                                     GRANDY
                         Probably not.

               INT. CLEVELAND CLINIC CORRIDOR -- LATER

               Grandy and Wills walk together --

                                     GRANDY
                         In these sorts of cases, it's best 
                         if she signs a consent.

                                     WILLS
                              (covering)
                         No problem.

                                     GRANDY
                         Good.
                              (stopping at the main 
                              entrance)
                         The last time Charlotte passed out, 
                         she regained consciousness almost 
                         immediately. The next time or the 
                         time after, she won't. When that 
                         happens, call me.
                              (handing him a card)
                         Here's my service. They'll reach me 
                         no matter where I am. In the meantime, 
                         I'll coordinate with Dr. Sibley.

                                     WILLS
                         I can't thank you enough.

               Grandy smiles and pats him on the shoulder.

                                     GRANDY
                         I haven't done anything yet.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Wills sits up, wearing glasses, reading a book. Charlotte 
               enters from the bathroom wearing a flannel night shirt --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         By the way -- where were you today?

                                     WILLS
                         What do you mean?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         When you called I assumed you were 
                         at the restaurant, but when I called 
                         back later, Jesus said you hadn't 
                         been in all day.

                                     WILLS
                         I was in Montclair, New Jersey.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why?

                                     WILLS
                              (playfully vague)
                         An opportunity.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, really? Sexual or professional?

                                     WILLS
                         I was considering opening a 
                         restaurant. But the rents are too 
                         high.

               He smiles at her. And she smiles back.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- MORNING

               Charlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest. She opens 
               her eyes. The room seems strange. It's the light.

               She rises up and turns around. Her eyes narrow with curiosity. 
               She crawls out of bed and runs to the window and looks out.

               She can't believe her eyes. Central Park is blanketed by 
               deep snow and more is falling. She calls out gaily --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hey! How do you feel about Christmas?

                                     WILLS
                              (sleepily)
                         Bah humbug...

               She runs back, laughing, and jumps on the bed, rousting him.

               MUSIC UP:

               A SEQUENCE BEGINS showing Charlotte and Wills during a day 
               of holiday shopping. The deep snow has slowed the city to a 
               crawl but filled everyone with good spirits.

               Charlotte and Wills move from store to store; they buy 
               wreaths, garlands, ornaments, candles, and, finally, a 
               CHRISTMAS TREE and STAND.

               Wills starts to lug the tree, but when it's obvious that 
               it's too much for him, Charlotte spots a GROUP OF KIDS 
               spilling out of a record store.

               The next thing we know the kids are lined up, carrying the 
               tree over their heads like a battalion of ants.

               Wills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator 
               and squeeze in. There's no room for Charlotte. She'll take 
               the lobby elevator.

               MUSIC OUT:

               INT. LOBBY ELEVATOR -- AFTERNOON

               Charlotte, carrying shopping bags, ascends in silence with 
               Michael. She has no interest in chatting. He, as ever, does.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Will you and Mister Keane be goin' 
                         away for the holidays?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I doubt it.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I've seen so little of America. I 
                         don't care for airplanes, you see, 
                         and I have so little time to travel.
                              (beat)
                         Did Mister Keane enjoy his trip then?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What trip?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Why, just yesterday.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I wouldn't really call that a trip.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Perhaps not. But I've never been to 
                         Ohio myself. They say parts of it 
                         are quite lovely.

               Charlotte goes pale. The elevator stops and he opens the 
               door.

               INT. WILLS' FOYER -- CONTINUOUS

               Charlotte steps out right into the kids who are roughhousing 
               and laughing. Each holds a five-dollar bill --

                                     MICHAEL
                              (calling out)
                         All right, you little hellions! Get 
                         in here!

               INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

               Charlotte wanders in. The tree stands erect. Wills, on all 
               fours, tightens the screws on the stand. He crawls to his 
               feet and studies it.

                                     WILLS
                         Straight?

               Then he sees her grave expression and freezes.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I thought we had a deal.

                                     WILLS
                         I'm sure we do. About what?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Lying.
                              (beat)
                         You were in Ohio yesterday.

               Wills stares at her for a moment, then explains without 
               apology --

                                     WILLS
                         I met with a heart specialist. He's 
                         willing to operate.

               For an instant she is surprised, but then her indignation 
               takes over --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But you know I don't want that! You 
                         know I've signed papers that --

                                     WILLS
                         Well, maybe I want it.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It isn't your decision!

                                     WILLS
                         Of course not, but if you'll hear me 
                         out --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No! I told you right from the start 
                         how I felt and you went behind my 
                         back! You lied and --

                                     WILLS
                              (exploding)
                         Oh, Christ, knock it off! You're 
                         such a god damn saint, so above it 
                         all, but you're scared to death! You 
                         do want to live! And if you were as 
                         honest as you say you are you'd let 
                         the doctors do whatever they can to 
                         help you!

               Her face shuts like a trap. She walks toward the bedroom 
               door --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I won't give people hope when there 
                         isn't any.

                                     WILLS
                         Why not?! Maybe we want hope! Or 
                         maybe we just need to know that we 
                         did everything we could! Maybe I 
                         need to know that... if I'm going to 
                         be able to live... to go on without... 
                         without --

               Suddenly, a sob catches in his throat. Charlotte, on her way 
               to the bedroom, stops and slowly turns around.

               She speaks matter-of-factly, without judgment or feeling.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Now I know why you hurt so many women. 
                         Because you always knew if you held 
                         on to one of them, you'd never let 
                         go.

               She turns and exits coldly to the bedroom. Wills sinks into 
               an armchair.

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- LATER

               In grey afternoon shadows, Charlotte lies on her side, fully 
               clothed under the covers, with her eyes open, thinking. She 
               hears something and looks back.

               Wills stands in the lighted doorway.

               She gestures for him to come. He walks over and lies down 
               next to her. She turns her back to him, so that he's spooning 
               her, but she takes hold of his hand, pressing it against her 
               chest and squeezing it like a doll.

               For a long time, they lie in silence. Finally, she murmurs 
               almost inaudibly --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         When we met, I was so lonely. But I 
                         didn't even know it. I'd been alone 
                         so long.. almost forever...

                                     WILLS
                         So had I.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But now we have each other.
                              (beginning to cry)
                         Oh, what would I do, Wills? What 
                         would I do if you weren't here? Where 
                         would I be?

               Fighting his emotions, determined to stay strong for her, he 
               holds her close.

                                     WILLS
                         You don't ever have to worry about 
                         that.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'll do whatever I have to! I'll 
                         tear up the papers! Whatever you 
                         want! Tell the doctor! Because... I 
                         really do want... I don't want to 
                         leave you!

               The dam breaks and she is wracked by sobs. Wills closes his 
               eyes, holds her even tighter, and rocks her in his arms.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- THAT EVENING

               Charlotte, still fully clothed, lies sound asleep. She slowly 
               awakens and sees that Wills is gone. She gets up on one elbow --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Wills?!

               She waits, hears hurried steps, then Wills sticks his head 
               in --

                                     WILLS
                         Yeah?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How long was I asleep?

                                     WILLS
                         A couple of hours.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Wow. And I'm still tired.

                                     WILLS
                         That's all right. Relax.

               Charlotte senses something odd in his tone. Her eyes narrow 
               with suspicion.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What're you doing in there?

                                     WILLS
                         Nothing.

               She laughs and starts to get up --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Liar!

                                     WILLS
                         Don't! Don't move! Just one more 
                         minute!

               He closes the door.

               INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- SAME

               Wills runs back into the room. The tree is fully decorated 
               now. He dashes back and adjust some lights along the base.

                                     CHARLOTTE'S VOICE
                              (from the bedroom)
                         What're you doing?!

               He runs over, inserts the plug and the TREE LIGHTS UP with 
               LITTLE WHITE LIGHTS, but for the STAR AT THE TOP.

                                     CHARLOTTE'S VOICE
                         Oh no! You didn't!

                                     WILLS
                         You were just going to tire yourself 
                         out!

               He grabs a chair and fiddles with the bulb inside the star.

                                     CHARLOTTE'S VOICE
                         This I've gotta see!

                                     WILLS
                         Just hold on!

               THE STAR LIGHTS UP. He jumps down and puts the chair away. 
               Then he runs over and dims the lights --

                                     WILLS
                         Finishing touches!

               He runs over and adjusts a garland. He runs back to the dimmer 
               and adjusts it again --

                                     WILLS
                         Almost!

               He runs back to the bedroom door and flings it open.

                                     WILLS
                         Voila!

               He looks into the room and freezes in the doorway. He backs 
               up a step, then, crying out, lunges into the room.

               MUSIC UP:

               EXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- NIGHT

               Charlotte, lying unconscious on a stretcher, wearing an oxygen 
               mask, is rushed into a waiting ambulance. Wills, beside 
               himself with panic, is gently barred by a MEDIC from jumping 
               in with her.

               INT. NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL LECTURE HALL -- NIGHT

               In the reflection of a projected slide, a hand offers a 
               CELLULAR PHONE to Dr. Grandy, standing at a lectern in front 
               of a group of doctors. He stops his lecture and takes the 
               call.

               EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT

               The ambulance rushes, light flashing, sirens wailing, 
               downtown.

               INT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

               Charlotte's stretcher is rushed into the emergency room at 
               the same time that Wills' cab pulls up.

               EXT. NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL HELIPORT -- NIGHT

               Grandy is rushed into a MEDICAL HELICOPTER.

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Wills looks up and sees Dolores and Shannon arrive.

               EXT. SKY -- NIGHT

               Grandy's helicopter speeds toward the City.

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Wills comforts Shannon. Dolores looks up and sees Simon 
               standing in the doorway. Then a CORONARY CARE NURSE appears. 
               She asks to speak to Wills.

               INT. MEDICAL HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

               Grandy looks out the window as the helicopter swoops down 
               toward the lights of lower Manhattan.

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT PRE-OP -- NIGHT

               Charlotte lies, semi-conscious, on a gurney. Wills appears 
               in the doorway with the nurse.

               EXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL HELIPORT -- NIGHT

               The helicopter lands and Grandy jumps out.

               MUSIC OUT:

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT PRE-OP -- NIGHT

               Wills sits down next to Charlotte's bed. He touches her hand. 
               Her eyes open then close again. Her breathing is heavy and 
               labored.

               Wills pushes a lock of hair off her brow, then whispers, 
               half to himself --

                                     WILLS
                         Time cannot break the bird's wing 
                         from the bird. Bird and wing together 
                         Go down, one feather. No thing that 
                         ever flew, not the lark, not you, 
                         Can die as others do.

               Charlotte's eyes open dreamily. She shows a faint smile at 
               the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What have I done to you?

                                     WILLS
                         Ruined me for other women.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No... I saved you for them...

               Her eyes close. Wills takes her hand and presses it to his 
               cheek.

                                     MALE VOICE
                         Is she type 'n' cross for six units?!

                                     NURSE'S VOICE
                         Yes, Doctor.

               Wills turns around and sees Grandy standing in the doorway.

                                     GRANDY
                         What're we waiting for?

                                     PRE-OP NURSE
                         Just you, Doctor!

                                     GRANDY
                         Then let's move!

               The NURSE rushes over to the gurney and in an instant 
               Charlotte is gone -- wheeled with a bang through SWINGING 
               DOORS into the operating room corridor.

               MUSIC UP:

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Everyone is there now -- John, Sarah, Celia, Simon, Dolores, 
               and Shannon. Wills enters silently. He walks to the new 
               arrivals and greets each one with an embrace.

               INT. CORONARY CARE OPERATING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Charlotte lies on the table. Grandy's eyes, visible above 
               his mask, are fiercely focused on his work.

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Shannon lies with her head in Sarah's lap.

               Dolores, ignoring the sign, smokes a cigarette.

               John and Celia sit side-by-side in silence.

               Wills stands at the window. He looks over and see Simon 
               standing close by. Simon looks at him, his eyes sad but eerily 
               calm. Wills shakes his head --

                                     WILLS
                         It happened so quickly. We'd just 
                         talked about the surgery. She agreed 
                         to it. But I thought there'd be time.

                                     SIMON
                         I've had friends who weren't expected 
                         to last till morning who lived another 
                         seven years. Another ran a marathon 
                         and died the next weekend. It's all 
                         so terribly random the way life 
                         actually works. I take nothing for 
                         granted.

               A light enters Wills' eye. He smiles as he remembers --

                                     WILLS
                         You know, it's funny, the first time 
                         I saw her, I --

               But then Wills hears something. He turns and there's Grandy 
               at the end of the long hall, walking toward the waiting room.

               Simon looks and sees him, too.

               Wills looks at Simon with alarm. It's impossible. How could 
               Grandy be finished so soon? Wills looks back at Grandy.

               SLOW-MOTION

               Grandy moves with long strides down the corridor.

               One by one, as they notice, Charlotte's loved ones react to 
               the sight of Grandy.

               Shannon rises from Sarah's lap, looks at the doctor, then 
               covers her face with her fists, holding her breath.

               Dolores crushes out her cigarette, her expression falling.

               Celia touches John's back as he rises and walks over to Wills.

               Simon's face turns to stone.

               John reaches for Wills, but Wills advances a few steps toward 
               the corridor, almost defiantly, his eyes riveted to Grandy.

               Grandy's head is down.

               Then, ever so slowly, Grandy lifts his head and in one 
               decisive move YANKS OFF HIS SURGICAL MASK and THROWS IT 
               AGAINST THE WALL.

               CLOSE ON WILLS' FACE as he realizes.

               His mouth opens wide as though to cry out, but no sound comes.

               INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- DAWN

               Wills stands in the center of the room wearing his overcoat. 
               He is pale, exhausted, his face expressionless.

               John stands, also wearing his coat, in the hall archway, 
               unsure whether he should stay or leave.

               Wills looks at the Christmas tree, whose lights still burn. 
               He slowly walks over and pulls the cord from the wall.

               The lights go out.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SPRING AFTERNOON

               A COUPLE walks down the same walkway. They are deep in subdued 
               conversation. All around them spring is in full glory. Melted 
               snow. Trees exploding with green. Birds singing.

               The man is Wills Keane, but he has markedly changed. His 
               dress is not so impeccable, his hair has gone grey at the 
               temples. His face, though still beautiful, has gracefully 
               turned the corner into middle age.

               Walking at his side is his daughter, Lisa, now well along in 
               her pregnancy --

                                     LISA
                         Actually, to be honest, Peter's more 
                         than a little freaked. I mean, how 
                         could he not be? He's twenty-six. 
                         His first child. A baby girl, no 
                         less. Nothing really prepares you 
                         for it.

                                     WILLS
                         I guess not.

                                     LISA
                         He said it's the first time since we 
                         got married that he's actually 
                         realized what marriage is. That it's 
                         forever. That he can't just pick up 
                         and run away to Nepal or something 
                         if we have a fight. That he's part 
                         of the cycle of things now. That 
                         he's gonna die some day. That it's 
                         the next generation's turn to take 
                         the stage.

               EXT. ANOTHER CENTRAL PARK WALKWAY -- LATER

               Wills and Lisa walk together in silence, enjoying the perfect 
               afternoon. Then Lisa smiles crookedly and slaps his shoulder --

                                     LISA
                         So what about you, Mr. Keane? You 
                         ready to be a grandpa?

               Wills looks over at the spot where he first saw Charlotte.

               He smiles with wistful confidence then, a little awkwardly, 
               puts his arm around his daughter.

               She is surprised at first. But then slowly, trustingly, she 
               rests her head on his shoulder.

               And they walk.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
